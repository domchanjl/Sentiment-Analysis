"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,1867,0

I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked,"So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. 

When she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.

So fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.

TL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.

Edit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things.",t2_2cd736ed,712,0

My friend committed suicide half a year ago. I think about him alot.,"I think about those last two weeks before he went missing.

I wonder what he was thinking and feeling.

I think about the time he was caught on CCTV footage slumped in front of a building window. Was he fighting tears? Was he trying to tell himself to stop? Was he trying to talk himself into continuing to walk to the bridge.

I wonder if he was hoping someone would talk him out of doing it those two weeks.

I try to remember what I was doing the day he went missing, I had only found out two days later.

I just can't stop thinking about him.

"Even when you warn people about your depressive episodes, they think you're joking","My last relationship was a mess but partially ended because of this. He said something like ""when we first met you were so fun and now all you do is cry."" I try to warn people. I'm honest. The winter is a really hard time for me. REALLY hard. The seasonal depression has me crying all day that first week of daylight savings. Sometimes I feel medium and when I'm medium I'm ok. I'm good at acting like things are well. And I'm a very affectionate supportive person. So people see me as a really positive vibrant figure in their life. When I go through depressive episodes every 3-4 months or so, people are appalled. With relationships, I'm very open. I tell them ahead of time. Like hey, I have panic attacks sometimes and I can't control them completely. Hey, I have depression and sometimes cry for no reason and lay in bed all day. Hey, the winter is hard for me and I cry a lot during it. And they are like sureeee ok. And then when it happens, they abandon ship because people are awful. People say they care about mental illness but they really do not. They don't want to deal with mental illness because it's a burden to them. They want me to be vibrant and supportive 24/7. They want me to always be fun.

Life's is a constant downwards spiral,"Everyone close to me is leaving me. My family makes fun of me or yells at me. Past joys don't bring much happiness.

When I finally felt good about how I look I decided I would try to get a girlfriend for the first time but she said no. Now my self image is lower than ever. A friend of mine killed himself but I'm so dead inside I didn't care. 

My only distractions are music and sports but the seasons are over and I don't have much time to listen to music.

When I told the closest person to me, who was very helpful for me in lowering my depression, that I selfharm she said I am looking for attention. 

Fuck this, and fuck looking for attention, is this what I get for asking for help? and who would cut themself for attention?

I can’t tell my family because they will make me feel worse. My brother attempted suicide and now my family is hateful to him, and mistreating him.

"Just a small venting, if you dont mind","These last 12 months, my whole life kind of flipped. It turned out for the better, and I couldnt be more thankful. I'm getting a nice promotion soon, I'm more independent, I'm more in control of my finances, and I've made some really good friends this last year.

But damn if it isnt difficult going through with every day. I'm exhausted mentally. My fault, since I've established myself as the comedic relief of those that I know at home and at work. 

It is difficult trying to keep others from feeling what I'm feeling. It is difficult just keeping up the feigned happiness. Yeah, I'll feel joy sometimes, but I'm so emotionally dead. I think I'm starting to abuse smoking weed, even though it also helps me medically for muscle weakness. I'm constantly high, trying to keep myself from the crushing sense of self hatred and depression. 

It's a lot. It's too much to handle sometimes. I'm slowly learning that I'm not even actually living, just existing. I work all of the time, and when I'm home, I'm doing nothing. I'm surrounding myself with games and entertainment, but still finding myself idle and in bed...angry, sad, confused, lonely, and empty. My thoughts scream at me to do something, and then when I do it, I find myself trying to distract myself into something else. 

I'm just tired. Its almost as if I am always wanting to go home, but there is no home to go to. I'm lost and I'm frustrated. I'm tired. But I'll keep that smile on my face..

I mean, I wish I could believe it all because I sure don’t. I have moments where I might feel a bit confident, but it fades so quickly. I just wanna feel like I’m in this with someone else.

Has rendered me stunned, dazed

I can’t seem to remember when it began

But here I stand, deadpan

Beckoning for me to walk blind

Lost and alone

Cold shivers pierce to the depth of bone




This melancholy heart 

Has begun to fall apart

Nothing has yet to sway

These unkind waves of absolute dismay

How can one person make you want to die .,"I have this “friend” and I really am starting to hate her. I’ve really only been nice to her. We were both in a friend group and when the friend group split up she was having trouble finding friend so she stayed with me because we didn’t have any beef unlike the other people. And I had quite a lot of friends, but when she came she kinda took them from me like they started not talking to me and started texting her and talking to her lunch. So now I am really alone. For her birthday I wanted her to know I still liked her so I got her a lot of stuff, and she gave me hot sauce packets from the lunches. She is pretty rich, so I don’t see why she couldn’t have given me something that actually has value, since I gave her $30+ worth of stuff. And I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, and she just me 10x worse. Her thing is if she doesn’t get what she wants from you, she whines for a bit calls you mean then goes and talks behind your back. That’s how I lost some friends, because I didn’t pay for her stuff. She didn’t have enough money, and I only had enough for myself. She got all pissed and started her whines and shit. I’m done with her, but there is no escaping her hell, she has all my closest friends in her palm. One word said about me I’ll lose all of them. She thinks she’s better than every one else, prettier, skinner. Her being 85 pounds still saying everyday “I’m so fat omg”. She always says her hairs bad and her face is ugly and round everyday. She always says she doesn’t have friends when she took all my friends making them dislike me so she can have more friends. She has probably 50+ friends now, always has someone to talk to, always texting someone. Gets a lot of bday and Christmas presents. Likes to rub it in that’s she’s better than me.   You are probably like, “just find some new friends!” You see I can’t, my school is small and has little people. And everyone else are ghetto girls and “hot Cheeto girls”. I’m stuck in this hell for 2 more years. My family is messed up, my parents hate me, think I’m a disgrace. They ignore me everyday, all they do is send me to school, pick me up. And they manage to do that without saying a word to me. My grades are horrible, I will probably never get in college which will upset my family even more. I have no talents, nothing to live for. I have no real friends, but I’m scared of loneliness. I want to escape this hell. I want to die. I feel like I won’t live past 20.

Depressed with good reason?,"Hello all.

My story made as short as possible.
40 yrs old

6 or 7 find out I'm G/R colorblind

7 find it I'm dyslexic as well

Up till about 11 I was sexually abused by Ann old family member

14 parents separated father became part time

17 first spine surgery for a herniated disc groom a MVA in which I was a passenger

20-24 I underwent 4 mite some surgeries, and then was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at 24 yrs old (turns out probably didn't need all of those surgeries as it was MS symptoms not some issues for some things)

36-One highlight in the last 20 years or so is I achieved a bachelor's degree which was something I very much wanted to do. Sadly I'm indebted for eternity and no better off for it outside of its something I wanted to do. 

Now I'm 40 have zero savings on soc sec and don't see much of a future. Once my land lady dies (she is 95) I'll likely end up homeless. 

I'm fucking depressed. I live in a society that has little sympathy for the chronically ill. I'm constantly in pain from the spine surgeries I probably didn't need. It's just wrong to have to live a life of indignity because I was born with fucked  immune system.

Your ‘impossible task’,"https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/depression-impossible-task-symptoms-sadness-twitter-a8515436.html%3famp
Do you have an impossible task? Have you been able to get past it? How?

For me it’s applying for jobs. I currently work 2 12 hour night shifts a week. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but night shift when you’re already dealing with MDD, anxiety, OCD and anorexia is horrific. Not to mention I’ve had to deal with so many awful people who have destroyed what limited confidence I had to begin with. I feel scared before every shift, and my dread begins all over again the moment I walk out of the lab. I’ve been at the job two years, over which time the MDD has gotten far worse and I’ve tried to kill myself twice, landing myself in hospital against my will three times. EVERYONE in my life has said I need to get out of it. 

The problem? CV and cover letter. That’s it. I can work 12 hour night shifts. I run marathons. I starve myself for days on end. I attained a degree in Biomedical Science. But sitting down for 1-2 hours to write a cover letter? Impossible. I just can’t. And I can’t explain why. The only reason I got this job is because I did heaps of work experience with them first. And before that I did conservation work at a wetland during the Australian summer despite having severe allergies and cholinergic urticaria. I knew it would be hell physically. But I went for it simply because it didn’t require a cover letter. That’s it. 

Do you have an impossible task? Have you been able to get past it? How?

In addition, I don’t know why, but i started to feel attraction towards other guys and it terrified me. I felt so guilty about it that i had to let chris know. I felt like i was falling out of love and didn’t want him to be stuck in a relationship with me that would be unfair to him as well. I felt like he deserved someone who also loved him in the same way. During this time, we would still hang out in the same friend group. He still wanted to be friends with me, so i agreed. He even let me stay at his place still, when he had friends over (this is my first mistake, I should have said no, but i also still loved him as a friend so it was always nice to still be with him, selfish of me). During this time though, he got super protective over me and still expected me to be his girlfriend, even though i made it clear that i didn’t feel the same anymore. I thought my relationship with his friends were platonic and harmless (and some of them i was friends with on my own accord). But he was so mad when he found out that I would hang out without him (even though, I would plan on seeing him later with them as well) he would get mad if I wouldn’t be back at a certain time. It was my fault for allowing myself to stay over. I probably gave him the wrong ideas. But he would get so angry and lash out at me, and curse at me and call me names. I’ll admit, my intentions weren’t alway pure. I would invite him to things with our friends still, but lowkey didn’t want him to come because I wanted to be independent without him. I wanted to know what it would be like to be single without his presence. He would get so mad when I wasn’t responding this one time. I invited him at first out of courtesy, but it was fucked up of me to not respond or respond late because I couldn’t decide if I actually wanted him there. Totally my fault and I feel awful about it. I was being selfish. The next day when I saw him, he was so angry and vehement, he threw his phone across the room and it accidentally hit me. It made a gigantic bruise on my thigh and i got scared. Later on, we went on a group tahoe trip. He was complaining that I wasn’t paying enough attention to him, but that wasn’t the case, he just wanted to believe what he wanted to and made a huge scene and hit the wall. I was so angry because it felt like he wanted to control me so i would purposely go out, when he would be in the room and vise versa just to show him that i didn’t care. We were already sleeping in the same bed, which is what he requested from me so i complied (this was a vicious cycle of feeling bad for him and not thinking about the implications of what it meant to say “yes”). I’m stupid and should have just cut off everything from him since i knew he still had feelings. For some reason i thought it could somehow still work if we were still friends somehow which was naive and dumb of me. I finally moved into my own apartment and stopped staying at his place. But he would still force his presence and drive to my apartment without my permission. During this time, i didn’t realize it, but i had feelings for one of his friends. I felt awful about it, and didn’t know what to do. I knew he liked me too, because he confessed to chris that he did and felt guilty about it. I felt the same way, and told him how i felt. We ended up becoming a thing and this is when i started distancing myself from chris. I would see him every now and then during group gatherings and other obligations. I knew if we were still going to be in the same friend group i had to tell him that him that the other guy and i were a thing. I ended up sending him a letter telling him that I have feelings for the other guy and that i'm incredibly sorry that i feel this way (i didn’t want to tell him we were already a thing because i was too afraid to hurt his feelings). When i told him, he drove to my place and told me to get in the car. During this time, he went beserk. He drove the car around like crazy, threw my phone out the window and threatened to end my life, leak my old nudes, and expose me to my parents. He dug his nails into my skin really hard out of anger. He ended up feeling bad and found my phone and gave it to me. After this i stopped seeing him. However, me and the other guy that i had a thing with ended up not being compatible. He ended up sexually assaulting me. He would come back to my place several times that night and was hitting the windows multiple times to try to get me out, even though I had fled to my friend’s place. My roommate texted and warned me about this. I would report this to the police the next day. That night, the other guy also ran into chris at the gym. He was drunk and belligerent and ended up telling chris that we had been a thing. chris called me in panic, I told him we had been seeing each other, but no other details. I was so disgruntled and had no one to turn to that I also told him about the assault. After hearing this, of course, he was furious and went to go try to beat him up. The other guy called me and told me to lie about the assault and to tell chris that i didn’t, so he wouldn’t get beat up. I felt so awful, this was definitely the lowest point of my life so far. chris felt bad and offered me to stay at his place for comfort and even told me that he doesn’t expect me to get back with him. I eventually told him that him and i had been in a relationship and had intercourse. This broke his heart and he told me that to make him feel better about this that he wanted to do it with me and in a sense “reclaim me.” I accepted this because I felt like it was the least i could do in order to make up for hurting him like this (i know, this was a really messed up way of thinking). Afterwards, everything was so fucked up that i told him that it’s probably best i didn’t stay at his place anymore, even though i appreciated his offer so much. After this, the other guy reached out to try to apologize properly. I agreed to see him to receive this apology, and he did apologize, but not really in the way that i wanted to. He kissed me and i fell for it. I thought he was genuine. But the next morning, i realized he wasn't. After i went to edc with my friends, i actually met up with chris because we always dreamed about edc so we thought meeting up for a day would only be proper. After coming back from edc with my friends, i realized that i was an idiot, completely stupid, and believed in the other guy when he wasn’t sorry at all. I texted him calling him out and saying that i’m better off without him. I blocked him from everything. chris found out about this from another friend and went beserk again. I don’t blame him, it was my fault again. He went to my house at 2am and told my parents everything that’s been going on.

One of the biggest things that i’ve learned from this experience is to just be more considerate of people’s feelings. My whole life actually, i’ve been a really nice person and super considerate of others, so it just shocks me to my core looking back how i didn’t consider chris’s feelings as much as i should have. I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life. I made mistake after mistake because of selfish reasons. I’m trying to move past this, and i think the first step is writing it down. A lot of my anxiety has come from the trauma that these events caused. I hope that by writing this down, I can be more honest with myself and understand these feelings of mine. For a while i was running away from this guilt, but I need to own up to it so that i never make these mistakes again. I hope that by materializing these thoughts, I can also make a more active progression to change. I have been dealing with so much self-loathing and hate for myself because i just know how fucked up everything got. Just reading this leaves me in bewilderment.

After things settled down, chris and tried to give our relationship another chance. We’ve been trying new things to work on attraction, and since he’s been so nice to me, it’s been progressing. Despite everything, i’ve known him for almost 6 years and i care and love him so much that life seems unbearable without him. He has forgiven me, but i can’t seem to forgive myself just yet. I want to be a better person, and i want to not let these acts define me (but what if i deserve to let it define me?). But sometimes, it’s hard because my anxiety from all this comes back. I feel sometimes like i don’t deserve chris. I fucked up, so i should live with the consequences. I feel so worthless that i get anxiety attacks. I have overcome this a bit through time, but it seeps back every now and then. This is interfering with the current relationship that I want to work out because if this guilt is always plaguing me, I feel like i can’t fully be present in my relationship now. I know most of you might not be able to sympathize with me, but i just need advice. It has been almost a year since all of this transpired. I have a much better support system of friends that i've never had before that i can convincingly say i know got my back, and am in a better place, so I do feel very grateful about this. I just feel so down about myself at times. Prior to all of this, my life has always been non-problematic and i've always had a good moral compass on my shoulder. However, i just can't help but feel so worthless at times. But any words of encouragement would help if you see fit. Sometimes it still feels like im hanging by a thread here.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: BIG SIDE NOTE. The worst part about everything is that I lost my entire group of friends that i made through them. I was dishonest at first about me and the other guys’ relationship because i was scared. But after they found out i was in a relationship with him and that i got assaulted, they all just blamed us for keeping our relationship a secret and didn’t think much of the assault just because we were in a relationship already. This was a big part of why i wanted to die for a while as well (should have added this in). It propelled me into feeling more worthless and unheard than ever before (please any advice on getting over carrying resentment for this would be amazing). I also think that i just have this undying love for chris because of how long i’ve know him, and try to understand him because i just feel so guilty of everything i inflicted. I want to go to therapy but right now it’s not at option so resorting to reddit. A thousand thank yous to people who took the time to read - you're amazing.

I really struggle to find enjoyment in things and i just don't see the point in being alive most of the time,"I don't know why i feel like this, I'm 21 and most of my friends are enjoying themselves and getting fucked up on the weekends. I just can't find it in me to enjoy anything , I try to at least work out regularly and i have a couple of close friends I've made throughout my life but other than that i just don't see the point in being alive. I can't shake the thought that it doesn't matter what i do with my life because one day I'll die anyway, truth be told I'd probably have ended it a while ago to speed up the process if not for the intense fear of death. Its hard to discuss this with people as they mostly assume I'm either being dramatic or nihilistic. It's almost like my fucking brain just doesn't allow itself to be happy like a regular persons.",t2_q3sbm,6,0
I wish i had friends,"(To start off I’m 16, male, haven’t been to school for a couple years for these reasons) So idk if this belongs here it’s just a rant pretty pointless but recently I’ve been feeling somewhat depressed, a few years ago I ended up developing social anxiety and isolated myself from the littlest of friends that I had at the time.
Recently I’ve been seeing a therapist and I’ve started feeling a little better and started leaving the house, only issue is idrk how to interact with people so it’s pretty hard for me to make friends  especially with not being in school

Not too long ago someone I knew on Snapchat ended up being a real dick and told me no one would ever want to be friends with me for reasons she wouldn’t say (?) so that has made me feel like total shit for about a week.
Anyways I went out yesterday and I came across someone I used to know as a kid, wasn’t really ever friends but we knew each other. We talked for a while and he put his number in my phone. The thing is, the number isn’t in service and he typed it fast so I’m not sure if he gave me a fake number or fucked it up by typing it so fast.

I was in that area this afternoon and I decided to leave a note in his door saying that the number said it wasn’t in service and left my number at the bottom. It’s late at night now and I still haven’t heard from him. 

I’m probably overreacting and he probably did just put it in wrong, but he did it really fast so idk. I feel like he gave me a fake number but he’s the one who talked to me and offered me his number, so idk why he’d give me a fake one 🤷‍♂️

Ugh I just feel like no one likes me or wants to talk to me and it’s been making me feel more and more depressed, I just feel like I’ll always be lonely and live a shitty life. I look good, I have a great personality, I’m fun and easy to talk to, so idk why I can never make or keep friends ☹️",t2_5u7u5b6q,9,0
What is happening to me,"Trigger warning: non consensual touching

Recently I was non consensually touched by one of my closest friends. We were drunk but he thought I was asleep when he touched me. Ever since, even though I have told school and my family and friends know, I haven’t been able to be truly happy. Nothing feels the same anymore, I shut myself off and don’t talk to anyone. I literally only reply to my boyfriends messages with “okay”. My parents are supportive but I can’t tell them what I’m feeling. I just feel so empty inside and making myself sad is so much better than the pure emptiness and nothingness that I usually feel. I have thought about hurting myself, and I searched my room for something to use but I couldn’t find anything. I don’t want to be that desperate to hurt myself again but it will happen. Please any advice will help I don’t know how to get help or find support.",t2_5vskwbbw,3,0

Nothing satisfies me.,"Growing up i allways felt like an outsider. It would take me allot longer to interact with other kids, as if i was first observing behaviour and judging before i could relate and connect with them. Everything felt like it was missing a piece and just because ""things happen"" wasnt acceptable to me. So i grew up analyzing soo much so so much that i lack that guillable and ignorant way of enjoying little things in life... I actually envy one friend in particular in which i deem the dumbest of us.. He can blabber, get amazed, shocked, worried about relatively nonsense things HE CAN actually small talk. So ive allways known i have a different perspective in life i am Now im 25 and feel like i got a hold of myself... To a point but in was in my highschool years i went through the typical crush then gf then betrayed scenario (happens to almost every1), that my out of the normal rational spiraled out of my control. Kept analyzing Every Single Detailed that happened day by day, in the hopes that id find paterns to correct myself. It felt like i was talking to myself saying ""you're in this sad state, and its only you're fault. You're the one who keeps getting into this... How about you unfuck yourself"". And so to avoid putting myself in situations in which i didnt feel comfortable i turned to educating myself HARD.. On how to read peoples posture, body language, tone of voice. Some would say it completley messed me up as a human, on the bright side though, i am confident enough to sit at a poker table, whilest cocky enough that i wont loose. And so about 3 - 5 times a year i get into unsatisfying state where theres nothing i can do which causes pleasure. I can now feel creep on me. Tend to start masturbating more, spending more money, sleeping more, reading more, playing video games more. I know how to handle it so i can damage control, tend to sleep more and educate myself with youtube or reading articles so i can indulge whilest keeping it away from my pocket. And while i can somewhat handle it i cant actually neither prevent it or end it. like its coming, so brace for impact. Its here, so deal with it. Its gone, try to enjoy anything... While you still can. And i feel like its getting progresively worse. I am currently running in this state which i got no name of it, and really needed to express myself in some way or to someone... I apologize if this isnt the sub to do such a thing.",t2_1567ie,5,0

"I’m having one of those nights where i feel like dying rn. I [24f] hate myself and a lot of my depression and anxiety stems from this.

Do you feel like there should be a word for something worse and deeper than depression?,"I feel like I've been at all different levels of depressed at some point in time. I can feel the differences, they're easy to recognize. But, sometimes, like now, there becomes a point where I'm so far past all the stereotypical depression stuff that I almost wrap back to ""normal""-ish... except... everything is far from normal. I function but I'm not really living. My mind is blank. I don't think about dying nor living. I'm exhausted and can't put into words how I feel about one thing or another because I don't know.

Im not in a state to help my suicidal friend,"For context, im 16 years old, my friend is 19 and lives on her own in another country so keep that in mind. 

Almsot 3 days ago she texted me that she was going to kill herself, she was very clear about how she was going to do it, how im should let her go, how "" it's not respectful to ask someone to live if their life isn't liveable"", you know, the whole ""im going to take all the pills- it's not working i didn't take enough- im gonna try stabbing myself- I'll sit outside until i freeze to death "" line. Ofc i was calling her and i actually texted her ex to call an ambulance( he's the only person i can contact in her country and he knows where she lives) but he didn't read it and i deleted it once i realized she'll survive. She's alive obviously and is acting like nothing happened.

Now this isn't the first time, it's actually probably the 5th time ( that i know of ), everytime it's like this, everytime she talks that way. Im usually not scared as i have been where she was multiple times, but this recent time? It triggered me, i feel exhausted, i want to harm myself which i haven't felt in months. She doesn't want professional help , im her only trusted source of support and i genuinely can't anymore. This is a cycle, she find someone to date, things are seemingly well and so is her mental health, it doesn't work out, she's suicidal, after 2 weeks, she starts talking to people again and doing risky things. She got drunk as fuck, she said she's meeting with a guy at his place and i think he's from tinder so that's not safe. Im tired, she's always dismissive of her feelings or expresses them in very concerning ""jokes"" ( i get it, coping mechanism but it's harmful if that's all you do). Im tired, im dealing with my own issues and have been suppressing them for months for her, i lose sleep ( time zones) for her, i genuinely take my phone everywhere and grab it st every notification because im so worried about her. Its a cycle, i know that i need to have a serious conversation with her but i know she'll make it into a fight ( we never fought but i know her) and will lose trust and probably attempt but the way things are heading?

Numbness,"For the whole month of February I was stressed out and would start crying at any time or place ( embarassing lol). I was in a really stressful situation and when I finally got out of it I couldn’t feel anything. For the past two weeks or so I feel no emotions. I try to distract myself by going out or spending time with friends, watching things that usually made me laugh but nothing sparks in me. When I’m out with people I have to force myself to smile or look interested because I feel nothing and I just keep zoning out. Even when I spend time with loved ones I feel out of it and I feel bad because I am not reciprocating the feeling at the moment because of this numbness.

I know my mental health has negative effects on those around me, but I cant give a shit. I'm not going to make their lives easier by pretending I'm okay; I'm not. I cant give a shit about the millions of people dying everyday, I cant give a shit about all the disasters that go on. I just have become numb to anything that doesnt directly involve me.

I have no one to talk to.,"I grew up the OutKast. I’ve never had friends or a group of friends and I was emotionally abused by my family. I resorted to music to deal with my issues and ended up getting far in the music business. I’m 22 and signing to interscope in May. I want to keep this anonymous for obvious reasons. I had a boyfriend but he doesn’t understand me anymore. My mom doesn’t understand either. I’ve had depression for about 7 years now but I am just now understanding that is what has been wrong with me. My ex boyfriend always blew my depression off because he thinks I have everything. Because of my career. But the truth is I really don’t have anything because I can’t find happiness. My management only cares about the way I look and how much money im going to be worth. I broke down today working out because I find it very sad that I have to look a certain way to have a successful career. I know it’s a part of the job but sometimes it bothers me. I just want to share love in the world but at the same time I feel so distant. I have music but have no one to share a connection with. I’ve been strong enough to stay away from drugs and alcohol but I’m scared my depression will get worse especially with more pressure on myself and with the business I’m in. I guess I’m just scared for my future. But I will keep fighting until I can find self love and happiness.

this is where i get off,"i think it’s really time for me this time. i can’t do this anymore. 

i was born in an abusive family, i don’t really feel like providing extensive backstory, but it was bad enough and weird enough that many people throughout my life don’t believe me, and those who have believed me don’t know what to do with me or what to even say. i have been suicidal since i was 7 years old. earlier than that i can remember not wanting to exist but not really being able to articulate it. now as an adult i’m in a terrible, very long term relationship with someone who’s also abusive, in a different way. i don’t go a day without arguing with him several times. it’s always the same shit. it’s practically scripted at this point, i feel like i live in a fucking mirror funhouse. it’s like i can’t get him to give a fuck about me or be considerate towards me. i’ve tried reasoning with him, begging, being basically verbally abusive but he just doesn’t care. nothing changes. he says he loves me but it’s clear that he just likes that i take care of him like i’m his mommy. i’m disabled and in chronic so i can’t hold a real job. couldn’t finish uni because of it. i have crippling social anxiety. this means i’m at home all the time and all of the responsibility falls on me. all of his problems are mine to fix, and my problems fall to the wayside. my whole life people seem to think that putting a roof over my head should be enough. i feel like no one really sees me. i don’t have any friends, my life is so depressing that i’ve fallen out of touch with everyone, or people just stop talking to me because i never have anything positive to share and my life is going nowhere. i used to be a high achiever and now i have nothing. fuck, i don’t even have health insurance now so i can’t even afford my medication. i’m engaged so i could easily change that, but the thought of getting married feels like a nail in the coffin. at least where i am i can fantasize about running away somehow and starting over without having to get a divorce... of course, i couldn’t run very far anyway, without real work experience, a family, a safety net of any kind, or a body that lets me do manual labor. 

anyway, we moved in with my in laws a couple of months ago because a rare, nigh invincible pest took over our apartment and it spiraled out of control. i’ve had nightmares every night and panic attacks every other day since i got out of that infested apartment, because i’ve been terrified that we brought the pest with us despite my level of care and vigilance because again, my fiance doesnt give a fuck and acts like a child all the time. honestly, it was largely his fault that the pest got out of control as i took it upon myself to contain the infestation and came up with a whole plan that he disregarded completely because he felt i was being “overdramatic”. of course, that ended poorly. doesn’t matter. tonight, i found hundreds of tiny bugs crawling all over a vacuum here. we clearly brought them over somehow, i don’t know how, but they’re here and it’s the last straw. i have a phobia of insects, these spread and breed like wildfire, and my in laws are not particularly clean people (not to mention they don’t think anyone is good enough for their son and don’t believe a word that comes out of my mouth). it’s a recipe for disaster and i can’t take it on top of everything else. it feels like a sick fucking joke, that i can’t have friends, a family, or a purpose in life and now apparently i can’t even have a safe place to lay my head at night. i’ve been hiding in the bathroom crying in the shower since it happened and i don’t think i’m going to make it to sunrise. my life has been a fucking series of ridiculous, totally absurd, horrific occurrence after horrific occurrence and there’s nothing i can do about it. i constantly feel like i’m screaming at the top of my lungs in pain in a room full of people while they stare at me blankly and shrug. i’ve felt so, so completely alone since i can remember and so helpless. the only thing i have control over is whether i live or die. i was never meant to be born anyway, my mom was practically raped and wouldn’t have an abortion. she always used to tell me she should’ve thrown me in the dumpster outside the hospital or given me up for adoption. the first time she told me that i was 3 years old. she was probably right, even then.

Going to a psychiatrist for the first time to deal with depression,"I have suffered from depression on and off for a few years, but it's never been this bad. I am typically the social butterfly of my friends and no one would ever be able to tell I was depressed until recently. Something happened and I began excessively drinking from November till February, not taking a day to be sober. My friends began to worry and reaching out more. It was not until I wanted to commit suicide about two weeks ago for a week straight that I realized it was getting bad. I still constantly go to sleep and never want to wake up. As someone that has never done this before I am just looking for advice on what to do going forward. I am looking to get on medication as I have lost all motivation to do literally anything or socialize with anyone, considering I used to be able to talk to anyone at anytime this is the most noticeable difference in my personality. 

For reference I am a 22 year old guy that takes adderall during times of high volume while in school. If there is anyone that also takes adderall and anti-depressants, do you know of anything I should look out for? Just some advice would be nice as I am scared my depression will get worse and I am worried the suicidal thoughts will also get worse. I want to feel like myself again I haven't felt like that since September and I have began to dread social interactions. Also, I do want to continue drinking as I am in college and enjoy getting drunk, obviously will only drink socially, but want to know if I should or should not drink while taking the medicine? Internet says no but I am also not supposed to drink on adderall and I do it anyway.",t2_wfyv3,3,0

"I relapsed into self-harm, please give me some upvotes, I'm sorry","I'm feeling very low, the new medication was working like a charm for the first 2 weeks IDK why, like the effect was immediate, and eventually the positive effects wore off and I was landed deeper into my depressed state. I was prescribed 20mg of Viibryd btw.  
I use to carry a stash of benzos in my backpack and my mother knows it. VERY VERY RECENTLY, I tried some tapentadol once and I liked it. NOW, my girlfriend is suffering from some lung infection that the doctor can't put his finger on, ultimately he prescribed her a Codeine syrup to lessen her cough, she pays around 15USD (800 Indian rupees) for prescription and the bottle costs like 120 INR (2 USD) for 100ML.....  
She has already been through 3 bottles, so, I being a good boyfriend, bought 30x 30mg codeine + 650mg APAP pills from my friendly pharmacy dealer beyond the counter. 

Now, I wasn't feeling well one night, very unwell, very very very unwell mentally. I took my benzos (like 3mg Klonopin-Clonazepam) and like 500mg Tapentadol if I remember correctly. If anyone of you knows, THESE ARE VERY HIGH DOSES, I have a huge tolerance for benzos but not for opioids, thankfully, Indian pharma is shitty quality, 500 was more like 300 IMO. 

Back to the topic, I took the pills, tried avoiding the mental and physical agony I was feeling while waiting for the pills to kick in after like, uhh, almost 2 hours, both pills were in full effect but I was still feeling very very very very very very very very very low both mentally and physically, I was just numb, couldn't slow my brain down enough to sleep or get into my senses. I tried youtube, Netflix, everything but nothing was diverting my mind. If I remember correctly, I popped 2 of those codeine pills (first time ever in my life).

I went to my kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife, went back to my room and starting cutting...... my arm. 16 cuts in total on my left forearm. I didn't tell my mom until I reluctantly showed her tomorrow morning after taking a bath. Her reaction? Oh good, you should cut your entire body. You should stop taking your meds if you are going to do this never the less. Shouted at me, didn't comfort me or feel sorry, just screamed at me. She bandaged me as if I was a street dog and not her son, violently, saying negative stuff about me all along, about how she handled my father for 25 years and she'd not think a single second before kicking this 'nuisance' out of her house, that she's not weak, she's strong and not weak, etc.   
Next day, I went to my room, opened my bag and took 2 codeine pills because the cuts were hurting, my dad saw me go into my room and he told my mom. My mom took all my pills and she asked me what these open pills are, I told her it's codeine and APAP that I got for my girlfriend. She counted the pills and said that there are above 20 pills here, how many does your girlfriend need? I said 8-9.  
She said I'll put that person in jail whoever the fuck is giving you these large amounts of banned medicines over the counter dot dot dot. I said that I asked the pharmacist for the medicine and he had 25, and he told me that nobody buys these anymore so it'd be better if you take 25 (I told her that he had 25 left) I took 2 for the pain and here we are at 23.

She didn't buy it, calls me a codeine addict, pills addict, can't handle my life, kinda grounded me but not exactly tbh.   
Earlier, I told her that in my 2nd year of college (currently I'm in 4th), I smoked weed, and after my panic attack in 3rd year, I can't smoke weed anymore, I don't enjoy drinking and I have tried a lot of other things with my roommate once for the sake of trying. I told her all this before all these cuts and the 'codeine addict' part... She made me flush all the pills into the toilet btw after the dad and pill incident.

I self-harmed again, fewer cuts but deeper, very deep tbh, almost needing stitches, she doesn't care, looked me straight into the eye and said "" so this is what you want, you want to emotional blackmail me? it won't work. I can see right through you. I'm going to call your girlfriend's parents and sue her for mentally torturing my son"".......  
wtf, my girlfriend doesn't do this, my mother is 50, yea, she's been through a lot and no one is listening to me in my family, not even my sister. I'm being treated as an outcast.  
After my second self-harm incident, I went out to my friendly pharmacist with one of my friends and bought some tramadol and APAP painkillers, they had 37.5mg tramadol and 300mg APAPand me weighing 220 lbs, I popped 4. My mother said no more painkillers for you, you won't even find paracetamol in this house anymore (she literally hid all the meds.....) and again called me a painkiller addict because she saw 4 tablets missing from the blister.

I did talk to her about her calling me an addict, I said that this is the first time and I've literally told you everything about my past drug use, etc, etc, at least you should believe me and trust me if you want, I'd stop taking any pills but stop calling me an addict because it hurts. This is the first time something like this has happened regarding me. No effect still continues with the taunts...

Can't Understand Why People Would Like Me and Self Doubt.,"I'm not sure if this is a symptom of depression, but after talking with someone I met for a while, I start to second guess myself and think they actually don't like me. I just think they're talking to me to be nice, so I don't feel bad. I recently met this girl and we started talking, but I just don't see why she could like me as a friend. Is this normal? I feel like everyone has ulterior motives, and I'm just sitting here questioning whether people actually like me as a friend and person.",t2_16qndi,2,0
Sobriety,"It’s weird how I view my sobriety, and how I have to handle my depression now without some sort of crutch. So recently I got a gift from my boss, it was a bottle of sparkling wine. It was a gift  for my help with the recent fundraiser for the non-profit organization I work at. I didn’t mention to them that I’ve been sober for almost 2 years. I was thankful and appreciative for the gift, in total honesty, and took it home and gave it to my parents. It’s weird how as time passes I forget how long it’s been since I had any alcohol. Before this I was on a 2-3 year binge of just drinking as much as I could. It didn’t matter what time if the day so long as I could mask my mental health problems I would do it. If it could shut the depression and anxiety up, I was up for it. I’ve felt weird when I’ve been with friends being the one that doesn’t drink, but I just can’t do that again. I still struggle to want to live now, like I did with drinking, it’s just a different struggle. My problems still exist as they did back then, I’m just not trying to destroy myself like I was. I tell myself that I can’t drink because I don’t want my family and friends to see that. Deep down I question if I lived alone would I just grab the bottle again. Do I care about myself enough to not drink if nobody would witness it.",t2_qh9w7,5,0

After breaking up with my girlfriend my depression has been returning back to me steadily,I’m in a confusing part of my life. I have been depressed about 2 years ago then I finally got my first girlfriend and she kinda broke me out if it. The relationship was miserable for a lot of it but I was focusing on something else rather than my mental health. We were together for a year and a half. We broke up about a month ago and it’s been coming back.

"Need everyones opinion, a dating site, or a site/app intentionally focused on matching people with similar life views and also mental health conditions (handicaps per say) (more in description)","I often see, and for myself, people who have been depressed for many many decades. I am curious if there would be an interest in a dating/just meeting friends app that is specifically targeted towards people who are looking for people who may also be depressed, anxious, introverted, etc.

I know that if you’re introverted, maybe an extrovert partner can benefit you to push you outside your comfort zones. 

But also, some people are introverts, or depressed, or socially anxious, and aren’t really interested in putting any more time into being a social butterly, or going to bars/parties, so maybe finding someone who likes to also spend their free time indoors not with many people would skip the incompatibility of an extreme extrovert needing social contact and an extreme introvert who likes to spend their time alone or with close intimate relationships.

For example, it gets really tiring to be depressed, whether that is because of your world view (everything is meaningless, people suck, I dont want to work my life away in this capitalist society), or because genetics, upbringing, brain chemistry, financial status, social status, whatever! It gets tiring to be around or in a relationship with someone who doesn’t relate to the mental illness(es). 

Would these be a bad idea?

He’s been to jail, rehab, the whole 9. I’m 22, in college and live by myself now. He reached out to apologize and I drove an hour to go visit.

I'm going to be 21 in a couple months and man I gotta say, life got really dull. I pay little to no attention to details of the world that surrounds me. I feel like routine is making my life monotonous. I can't recall the last time I had a dopamine rush (except when I gamble or have sex but that quickly goes away, don't ask why).

I don't know, I often have those horrible thoughts that life will remain that way and those exciting times will always be a thing of the past. That I'll die without having  another chance to re-live my childhood, which is unevitable cause you know, time travel aint a thing yet.",t2_57xpt1xx,3,0

I discovered exercise ends depression almost always. By accident.,"In my 40s and been diagnosed and dealing with this for 3 decades now. Therapists, psychologists, Rx. Very serious trauma-the kind that freaks doctors out was/is part of it.

I accidentally stumbled into riding bicycles, then got really into it, then started jogging, then swimming. I cannot do the gym-I hate it. I have to be outside and so far I prefer being solo.

The further I run, ride, or swim the better I feel. The less I care about the past or future. The more I enjoy the present. My apt is cleaner. My taxes are in order. Everything I used to put off is done. 

I didn't know how bad, dangerous, cloudy, and self perpetuating my own thinking was until just recently. I was stuck in a cycle for years.

Now if I'm having a bad or depressed day I can just go run or bike. Had a brutal week recently. Rode a serious uphill mountain. Got home but mind was still not well at all. I ran 6 miles and was good to go. Even at mile 5 I had to pickup the pace because of what was bothering me-but I got so exhausted I didn't care anymore. 

I had massive anxiety about-I know this sounds funny but it's true-about dealing with government beauracies. Sailed thru the DMV like a cake walk last week.

I don't try to make friends or do anything social-ever. Tonight I walked into a room full of strangers-all triathletes-and kept up with them for and hour and half spin class. I would've never done that a year ago. The social aspect of going to an event and knowing not a single soul was a huge ""I'll pass"" for me for decades.

If I am having a personality conflict with someone at work I just exhaust myself before work and I'm too tired and have too many endorphins floating around to care.

A couple months ago I was riding long distance and this Frenchman rides up besides me and as we ride he explains how cycling saved his life. He explains to me what is happening to me now. He has ridden all over the place now-across continents. He was enjoying his day and I apologized for being lost in my thoughts-he replies ""That is why we cycle. It saved my f*©✓ing life!"" Hilarious-all in a thick French accent.

I am starting to really enjoy life for the first time in years. There are occasionally even amazing moments. It has gotten to the point when I don't feel like going to exercise I go anyway because it always works.

I didn't plan this and I didn't decide to do it. I went for a bike ride and enjoyed it. So I bought a used road bike because faster was more fun. I never tried to do anything besides a longer distance. Same w jogging. And swimming. I just said ok last time was half mile this time add a quarter mile. I'm down 20ish pounds so far. The opposite sex makes comments about it. 

I get along better with people who normally irritate me. I don't get as worked up about near as much. 

I wish I would've known this in my late 20s but I'm glad to know now.

After about 6 months I started surprising myself. One day I randomly rode 55 miles when planning on doing 20. One day I rode 3700ft up. I was struggling with jogging more than 10 minutes so I quit for two weeks and woke up and ran a 5k straight one morning. Within 3 weeks that had turned to 6 miles.

I told my psych and he said ""THAT will do more for you than anything I can ever tell you or prescribe.""",t2_3igge28g,2,0

I suck.,"I didn't go to class AGAIN today. I haven't been in a minute. I woke up on time (5:30 am) and it's not even like I wanted to go back to sleep. I just... sat in bed, staring at the clock for an hour and a half until I'd already missed my bus.

I'm not happy at college. I was for the first year but this year has been extremely hard for me. Everything at home sucks. My mom is depressed and either taking it out on me or not talkinh to me at all, we're behind on bills and our hot water was out for a while, I can't sit down for 5 minutes because I'm the only one in the house who actually does chores. And then I go to school and I just get berated by everyone. ""Why haven't you done homework?"" ""Why do you look so tired?"" ""Why can't you understand this simple subject? I've explained it three times."" I can't keep up with what I'm supposed to be doing and I can't fucking focus and everywhere I go there's always something fucking wrong with me.",t2_5ugv8s8h,1,0

Help- Wellbutrin and speech/language problems?,"Hi guys. So, I’ve been noting since I got my dosage of buproprion XL to 300 that words in general are “farther away.”

I’m a writer and my vocabulary should be pretty darn large, but I struggle expressing myself vocally now. I feel I can barely string together a coherent sentence, and during conversations this makes me fumble and be unsure of what to say, or I say stupid stuff.

Wellbutrin is the only medication that seemed to do much of anything for me. But now this. I barely want to live anyway, so if my cognitive ability is going to get stuck in grade school, and my conversational skills are going to take a dive, why be on anything at all.

I’m on currently:
80mg Prozac
450mg XL bupropion (wellbutrin).

TL;DR: I’m thinking of going off all my meds right now. In response to this particular symptom. 

Can you all please give me advice of whether I should or not? If yes, can I stop taking all my meds tomorrow morning and not have long-lasting brain damage (obvi still going to go through withdrawals).

Maybe I’m just fated to be miserable and alive.",t2_3y2fxrju,4,0
I don't know what to do,I've been depressed for a while a few years. I started seeing this girl I've known for a couple years. She's also damaged.

Please someone talk to me!,"I thought last year was the worst year of my life after losing my best friend and having no one to support me. I'm not gonna lie, it's turned me quite bitter. Well this year hasn't been any better and I feel like things are taking a toll. It all started when I had to move back with my ex because my old roommates werent responsible. This ex was cheating on me when my best friend died- cheated other times before. But makes me feel like hes still doing me a big favor by letting me live here. Well, about a month after living here I ended up getting punched in the face where my face was almost destroyed. (This was 3 and a half weeks ago) cops were involved. Nothing was done since I had no where else to go. I would go to a shelter if I didnt have to be separated from my dog, but idk how they work. Well, I cancelled plans for weeks because of how bad my face was and I didnt want anyone else to know since the cops didnt even help much. (It was the first time of him hitting me after knowing him for 2 and a half years, I was stunned. I havent been hit like that since I was a kid by my mom.) Well my birthday was the fifth of March, and my aunt died the same day. I went to a benefit to raise money for her burial, and my uncle I loved all my life ended up calling me hot and upset I changed my hair. (I went back to my natural.) It made me feel disgusting. He gave me the strangest hug there and it was so feely it made my stomach drop and feel empty. We were alone and I was so happy a stranger came out. He tried telling me my step dad had the hots for me too, when my step dad is literally my only family member I can trust. I havent spoken to anyone because I feel so betrayed and disgusted. I don't want to type detail because my mind is running a mile a minute. I don't know why he had to call me hot, not only once three times. Before it was just him and I, it was a whole bunch of older guys he's friends with saying the same thing. It makes me not like guys almost completely now. 

I found out people don't want to hang out with me because they don't know how to help or react to my issues and it hurts me. Its hurts me sooooo much. I've been alone since my best friend died, even my birthday,  and I can't handle all of this! I want the words that came out of my uncle's mouth gone. I don't even want to exist anymore. I came here because its anon and I need someone to give me advice or help me. I've been on so many meds they don't help. I just want someone older than me to actually mean and tell me  that things will be okay eventually. Because I cant take anymore! I'm a female that just turned 24. I feel so dumb because of my choices I'm just trying to survive. If my ex never kills me anyways since he suddenly wants to start hitting me now.  Please, can someone please talk to me? Any other women who have been to shelters, could you sleep with your dog and have them with you? My dog is my only comfort now and family. I can't go anywhere with out him.

I just wanna give up,"
It all just feels so pointless. I'm either depressed the entire day or anxious and in the rare occasion I feel neither its all just extremely dull.

I suppose I should be happy, I've got a few great friends. I'm graduating in a few months and my parents do their best. But meh I don't feel happy. At least not for long. I know last week was quite good, had a holiday so I didn't have to go to my internship so I could just stay at home and get some rest, do some of my hobbies and game for a bit. Friday and Saturday I went out with friends. It was great and especially seeing those friends again over the weekend really made that week but as soon as I got home Saturday evening the shitty feeling I had before the vacation came right back in its own new way and hasn't left me since.

It's just that as soon as I have to go work again it feels like I won't have time to do ""fun"" stuff again. Work's fine, apart from one guy who mocks me sometimes the people are nice and I enjoy it. If I can focus I won't be depressed but if not its going to be a long day where I can't get anything done but no matter what, as soon as I leave work at the end of the day I'll start feeling like absolute shit. I'll go home and know that I won't really have time for myself to really relax. I have like 2 hours before I should go to bed and it just feels like that's not much time to do anything. At the end of the week I'm exhausted so I don't really know what I should do in the weekends. Besides that I don't really know what interest me anymore, I'd like to pick up a hobby I can either do alone or with others but I don't have any interest besides programming and gaming. Sure some stuff related to programming but none of my friends really care about it.

Just knowing that if I don't fix my issues it will probably stay like this for a very very long time sucks. I think I know what my problems are yet I don't have a solution. I know that some of these vents sometimes help with getting my thoughts in order and relieve some stress but doing so on reddit is really hard and the other option is venting to a friend but that gets me so anxious.

It's just too much. I want to take it on one step at a time but I need like baby steps. I mea I feel like I do yet even getting out of bed without feeling like shit seems like taking one hell of a leap forward and every single day starts the same way and ends the same way and that shit feels so dull. Knowing the next long years will all look the same and probably get shittier with each year just make me want to give up.

Sometimes I feel like crying. Today I was at work and after some frustration I just felt like resting my head on my desk and just cry it out but ofcourse I can't do that.  Other times I just am not able to and I feel like its the only real way I can let out way too much bottled up emotions.

I don't really know how much of what I said makes any sense, sentence construction might also be a bit weird since its just a bit too hard to focus.",t2_3qzlvxl8,5,0

Hangover,"what do you do 

when you feel like it is over ?

when all you feel is blue 

like it’s a bloody hangover 





when being out and about 

turns into pain 

when you feel like there’s no way out 

and you’ve got no one but yourself to blame
 



  
what do you do 

when your salad days are gone.

when all they can do

is force you to move on.




when the beauty of innocence and pure youth

gives its way mercilessly to the so-called truth.

when every nook and cranny of former bliss

turns into something you don’t even miss.


  

what do you do

when that whisky no longer helps.

when each and every part of you 

is on the verge of facing potential death.



 
when it is not amber nectar 

that causes incessant hangover 

when it is the pain,the misery ,the neglecter 

that won’t let you be sober.

I feel like i have a weight on my head thats dragging me to the floor. 

idk if anyone can relate but it feels like a heavy headache, my head doesn't hurt so its not an actual headache i guess but it feels like my head is hurting... and my chest just feels heavy but not as much as my head does. i feel like the voice in my head telling me to sleep is sabotaging me. 

I have a friend at school who i have opened up too a little, they know i just have a hard time and they used to try to talk to me. they used to ask me whats wrong and we would talk everyday and when i was tired i would just hang around them and stay quiet(cuz thats what i usually do when im not feeling well) but im not mad at them or anything and i try to make it clear. like i still want to talk and be a friend even though i feel heavy i still want to have a friend to talk to. but i feel like i have annoyed them by being so sad all the time. they say that im always welcome to hang out with them and it doesnt bother them that sometimes i stay quiet at lunch with all of our friends, but that was a while back and i feell ike things have changed, im losing my only friend because im just so miserable and i dont know what to do, 

i feel like with the people that dont know how miserable i feel its so easy to act normal and be happy and laugh but with people that know i feel like i cant act happy at all, its harder for some weird reason and i feel SO bad for being so miserable in front of them. i try not to express my feelings anymore when they ask because i feel like its not anyone elses problem but mine but i dont know if thats whats pushing them away because i just cant open up anymore. like when i hang out with them i try so hard to be happy and normal but they just dont reciprocate like they used to and when i see them to talking to someone else they are so excited and happy. they havent said that i annoy them but i feel like i do so now i just try to distance myself to make it easier because i dont want to annoy them but i cant tell if im pushing them away more because of this or helping them so i dont annoy them. im just confused. any advice? can anyone relate?",t2_5oue307u,1,0
I ruined my life plans two years ago and am still recovering.,"Two years ago I was “kicked out” of the Army because I got a DUI right after I returned from my deployment. I was 24. I joined when I was 18 (2012) and was loving it. Everyone got along with me. I felt like I belonged. I had goals, both short term and long. People would complain about the Army but I always looked at it as the best thing to happen to me. My father and both of my grandfathers served in the Army. My first duty station was in Germany when I was 18. I started partying and drinking a lot there. It was such a change of what I was used to. I got in a little trouble there. Moved on to a base near Seattle in 2015 and kept my partying habits. I was doing great with my military career, though. I was getting the highest scores on fitness tests and getting promoted rather quickly. Stayed out of trouble for the most part. Then I deployed to the Middle East in April 2017. Returned in January 2018. Nothing traumatic happened during my deployment. No combat engages or anything, but my drinking seemed to just get worse when I got back. I got a DUI three months after I returned to Seattle. Two months later, I was packing my bags headed back to the house. I got an honorable discharge and even get disability for my injuries sustained during my service, but that’s not the point. My whole life revolved around the military. It fit me. I could “play the game” as much as they wanted. I respected my superiors and they respected me. I had role models and I was a role model to others. I had a long list of things I wanted to do in the Army, spanned out over the next twenty years.

Since I have been out, I went to school for a few months using my GI Bill. Drinking was still a problem. I hated the jobs I had because it wasn’t the same as the military. People didn’t act the same. Everyone seemed much more selfish and I lost the feeling of esprit de corps (pride shared by members of a group). On top of that, I lost contact with most of my friends from the military. I felt like they looked at me different now. I felt ashamed. I can say I have a few that stuck with me till this day, but a lot just cut me off. I got out in July 2018. In March 2019 I used heroin for the first time. I have been addicted and have been burying myself in debt and a shit credit score since. (Long story short)

Last week I came clean and confessed to my friends and family that I had been addicted to heroin for the past year. Before that, no one knew about my addiction besides my drug dealer. I feel like that is the first positive step I have taken since I got that DUI. It seems like it’s been downhill these past two years, and I still miss being in the military terribly. I just hope I can find happiness elsewhere. I climb cell towers now and the guys are pretty cool. Some of them are veterans. I told them I had been using heroin as well and they are going to help me stay clean. I just hope things get better this year. I might even start going to church. I have been depressed for too long. 

This post turned out longer than I intended, and I am sorry for that. For anyone else going through something, I truly hope it gets better for you. Thank you for reading

Question on suicide,"Just wondering abt this qn for years: is it true that people who have attempted suicide, could have already been planning the action in their heads for months and even years? Because im sure having suicidal thoughts would fuel such behaviour in some way or another. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years, and everytime I've killed myself a million times in my head. I think about scenarios of myself jumping off a building, taking pills and no one will ever know I'm dead. Even right now, if I tried to kill myself and it succeeded, no one would know or care. The worst thing is when its not successful, I would end up handicapped and live with it for the rest of my life. So taking my own life becomes a huge gamble.

I need a distraction but I can't muster any interest in anything.,"I quit working last week because I'm pregnant and due at the end of this month.

I'm already bored out of my skull but I can't get excited for anything.

I've played a few of my go to video games but I lose interest or get way too frustrated way to easily. I can't find any new games that spark any excitement.

The internet, especially Reddit, is flooded with political discourse and only serves as a reminder that I'll be bringing my daughter into a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, suffer, die, and the middle class lives in blissful ignorence with their heads firmly up their asses. The guilt I have over this is intense.

My husband tries so hard but there's nothing he can do. So he just kind of lingers waiting for me to come up with something, anything that he can do to help. Cue more guilt.

I know I need to get help but I'm in this awkward position where I've only managed to stay qualified for government health insurance because I'm pregnant. After my baby is born I likely will get kicked off again but I still won't be able to afford private insurance. Even the cheapest plans have deductables in the thousands that I'll never reach short of getting hit by a bus.

Even if I get help now, I'll likely lose my insurance in the next few months and have to quit any therapy or medications. Last time this happened and I had to quit my meds cold turkey I wanted to kill myself for 3 months straight before I balanced out to my normal level of depressed.

I just don't know what to do with myself except hope that this baby comes sooner than later and the drive to give her the best life possible will keep me going.

Edit: But wait there's more. As I'm laying here being miserable I remember more miserable things. Yesterday I actually mustered the energy to do some cleaning. I spent a good portion of my day cleaning my kitchen and dining room. I cleaned and organized cabinets to make room for baby stuff and scrubbed from top to bottom.

I feel completely confused a lost,"I've been dealing with depression and PTSD since childhood. I recognize that I'm very sensitive to what situations I'm in and that it effects my mental health. I'm a strong willed person and no matter the cost, I'll always remove myself from whatever situation that's causing me more pain and trauma.

Whether I'd have to move, lose a job or lose a relationship- I'd put myself first because I knew my kids needed me to be strong.

About 2 years ago, something happened to me that really turned my whole world upside and made my depression and PTSD worse than anything that's ever triggered me before. It's hard to function. I invested the small amount of money that my husband left me when he passed (this isn't the incident I'm referring to) into moving to a town I never lived in before, for work. A couple months later, the small local company I was working for, closed down.

My bills all have disconnect notices and my rent is now going on 11 days late. I'm going thru a process to get a new job but it's in a secured building so there's lot of backgrounds checks and clearances etc, so it's taking forever. I'm just at a loss. I can't even buy myself feminine products. It's to the point were I'm emotionally unravelling more and more. I've applied everywhere else for a temporary job, McDonalds, stores, gas station, anything to keep me going. No one will hire me and believe me, I put on a happy face and am a completely friendly person. It's not like I walk in a depressed mess.

I'm so terrified that I'm gonna end up homeless when I'm so close to actually achieving something. I've been a complete insomniac for about 4 months. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days. I feel like I'm going in circles. I can't stand anything. I'm praying this job comes thru and that I can function. 

Does anyone understand what I'm saying? How do you pull thru this? I honestly can't take anymore. I barely shower or bother getting dressed. It's like, ""Why dirty the clothes when i have no money to wash them?"" ""Why waste the soap when i can't buy more?"". I'm fuckin tired of it all.",t2_5t0zgqta,2,0

My life feels meaningless,"I know this has been said a thousand times over. But I guess it just feels better to write my own post. 

I’m (20m) in 1st year of university. I’ve felt the lows of depression, but now I’m at a point where I almost feel nothing.  Nothing interests me. I used to love playing video games, going home and laughing with my family on weekends, watching Netflix. But now nothing feels worth doing. The only time I get excited is when it’s Friday and I can drink and maybe do a line of blow or 2 to actually give myself some happiness. I don’t have a drug problem or a drinking problem, but Friday and Saturday nights are the only time I actually feel excited....

It got worse when I met this girl, who actually made me excited to go out and do things. To just be with her made me happy and smile.  But to add even more shit to my already meaningless life she constantly gets super close to me, we kiss, sleep together, laugh together. and I’m so happy, but then she’ll push me away, hard. She’ll act as if I don’t matter and has zero disregard for me or how I feel... I’ll tell myself that I have to cut her off, but then she’ll come onto me and I just can’t resist.... This girls toxic, but thinking about how happy I am when I’m with her, and comparing it to every other thing in my life, just dulls everything even more.  

Every single day is another dull, grey, boring experience and the only thing that brings any relief is sleep.  I don’t know what to do or who to turn to cause even trying to explain it doesn’t do the dread I feel every day justice.",t2_5wge2scw,2,0

Can't find a gf,"Hey fellow anonymous Reddit people.

I kind of need to just rant to someone and talk about how I truly feel since I have nobody I can tell this to in real life 

But the truth it I'm honestly depressed, I used to look down on people who say that. Like why are you depressed that sucks but get over it, etc. But now it's come around and kicked me in the ass. 

I'm really losing motivation in life, I'm getting pretty old I'm 30 now, I've only had 3 relationships in my life they all didn't last very long. And everyone I see now is married or has a bf/gf and it drives me insane.

My thoughts are the worst, 
- am I not good enough, 
- is it my skin color ? (Tan) it seems like all the girls I want only want white guys. 

And then on top of that I'm envious as hell
I can give you 1000 examples but I recently fell in love with (or at least have a huge crush on) a girl who is married. I can't help it she is perfect in my eyes. I see her 2-4 times a week and we hang out for a couple hours each time. Sometimes she tells me about her relationship issues. I just wanna tell her break up with that dude and be with me but I know that would ruin the friendship we have. Then the worst part is like right now 1 am I can't sleep , and just thinking we'll she's probably getting fucked right now. 

What makes me mad is when people try to give me advice, a friend just texted me like ""oh you have to just wait until someone comes to you"" or other people like ""God has the perfect girl for you in his plan"" or ""there are plenty of girls out there"" 

Well what the hell if all that is true I wouldn't be 30 and single when I'm not working or doing something I think about how every girl I've ever had a crush on is dating somebody else now in bed with somebody else getting fucked by someone elae, would they even care if I was gone.

My average grade would still be a 61/100, so passing, and I have enough compensating grades to lift that to at least a 75/100 so whatever.

I wanted Freedom,"When I was a kid my father ruled the family with an iron fist.

I wasn't allowed to go anywhere but school and maybe church. 

I had to beg to go anywhere else. I had to ask permission to go to the bathroom, eat, or watch TV.

If he let me go anywhere he would go with me. I had a couple friends in school but they weren't allowed to come over and I wasn't allowed to go see them 

I never went anywhere without him. NEVER 

He treated my mom the same. If she cleaned and missed a spot he would open the cabinets and take everything on the floor. She also had to beg for food.

When I was 5 he took all my toys and burned them in the backyard. I had a favorite uncle that had died a few months before.  He gave me a rainbow Brite doll that I cherished. He burned it too.

That was the night I told my mom I wanted to go to heaven and be away from him. I remember swallowing a bottle of asprin. But it only made me sick to my stomach 

He knocked up my babysitter and when my mom found out he hit my mom because she got mad.

I remember praying to God to either take me or my dad. I felt guilty for praying for my dad's death.


I hate him for fucking up me, my mom, and my childhood.  He's dear now and I was always told not to speak ill of the dead. But because he's dead doesn't change what he did to me and my mom",t2_589qz4gi,3,0
Smartphones and the internet are a direct contributor to mental health,"I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago.

I feel in the age we are now living in, everything is connected and i feel this plays a huge role in peoples moods and overall mental health. Arguably, people seemed happier and more content without all this information being thrown at us from every angle. Ok, pre-internet days there wasn't enough awareness for certain things, the internet does have it's good points but i feel how much internet you use has a massive impact in your over-all mood especially with the amount of information we digest when we go online, our brains have to work twice as fast and twice as hard to process all this information.

I'm on a bit of a weight loss journey at the moment and i need a lot more positivity to keep me focused and people who have done internet detoxes before have said they felt there mood improved and were able to do more things without constantly wanting to go online.",t2_2s3zrr9x,6,0

How to deal with numbness causing for lack of creativity and joy?,"Naturally I'm a pretty creative and sensitive person. I love art and everything creative in life. Actually, when I'm feeling good I can get pretty spiritual. I always feel like wanting to make *something*. Unfortunately I suffer from a lot of mood switches and I feel numb quite a lot. So please understand me good, I'm not sad. But I'm not happy or joyful either. I'm just numb. 

This also has a **lot** of effect on my creativity, joy and obviously motivation. I don't get the good-good feelings from doing something I actually LOVE. For example I absolutely love music, listening and making music. But whenever I'm feeling numb or depressed, one of the first things I stop doing is anything related to music because it doesn't please me. And that bothers me quite a lot actually.

IM BECOMING DANGEROUSLY DEPRESSED ABOUT MY HEIGHT.,"People who are taller have it easier in a lot of areas of life. Being an athlete, aesthetic purposes, ability to be the alpha male of a friend's group (weird one I know but still true) but the one that is the affecting me the most, is being in a relationship. I'm 19 and I haven't been in a relationship that's lasted a month. Now however, it could also be down to my 4/10 (being kind) looks or my shitty, boring, unsocial personality but I'm pretty sure it's my 5'6 (5'7 with shoes) height. There's nothing more I want right now then to meet a girl and just be with someone all the time and maybe it doesn't work out but I literally don't know and want to experiment. And what is another ABSOLUTELY HUGE factor, is how EVERY single one of my (over 5'11 btw) friends have girlfriends or have girls after them. I'm literally not talking to One.

I'm just waiting for the moment when everyone else finally realizes how worthless I am.

\---

These are the things I whisper when I'm asleep. These are the thoughts that try to bury me in a protective shell. These are ingrained beliefs formed by experience. They make me want to curl up and isolate. To protect me from the despair I feel when I have to face the truth: nobody in the world loves me, so I must not be worth loving.

The typical reaction to that is doubt. No, your parents love(d) you. I hated hearing that growing up. When I went to live with the youth ministers from church, I was 15. They took me in because I had dropped my at-risk-youth hs/college program classes. This was due to my mother telling us that we were going to get evicted as she couldn't pay rent. She said this while she was on a 72hr pysch hold. She had been put there after she called the suicide hotline. The social workers came, it was dark out. She had been in her room sobbing uncontrollably. Lying on the floor (her bed really, we didn't have mattresses). She had stolen money from her job to go to the casino. Her plan was to win and replace the money before Monday, nobody at work ever knowing. Like most nights, she lost.

I began living with them in October/November. Fast forward to winter break. They ask me if I want to go home for Christmas. I say no. They say it's important to see my mom, she misses me. ""No, she doesn't"". You're just saying that, you need to go for her. Alright. I go. I see her for maybe five minutes over a week. Christmas passes, I go back. They ask why I'm back. I said I went till Christmas, saw her, mission accomplished. They drove me back. Got another five minutes, in passing over the final week of break. They didn't have to take me in, maybe they changed their minds and it was easier to pretend. For me, that said everything. It wasn't long before I was tired of their rules and decided to move back home, to help my mom out, because she loved me.

I now know better. I'm on the path to healing. To accepting myself, even when I fail. Failure is especially difficult because it feel like confirmation of all those thoughts. So I try to avoid it at all costs, but inevitably, I fail there too. I'm becoming OK with that. Learning how to accept and love myself, one moment at a time.

and then i just told her that screaming and shouting isnt making me feel better and that i just dont want to talk and she kept asking is it the mind or fever or and like shouted back and then she basically blamed it on my lack of desire and will and said god cursed her with this and cursed me with this and blamed my attitude for everything and then she just kept screaming that god gave me this life and 
like basically she accused me of always being so nice and talking to my doctors and stuff and like how i promised that i would tell them stuff when i wasnt feeling good but now im not keeping my word but like when u see someone like that DO U REALLY HAVE SUCH LOW FUCKING EQ that you cant like give them space and time and just BACK OFF. why does everyone fucking assume that if depressed people dont talk about it, they’re repressing shit? ITS NOT SO SIMPLE.

I talk. When I want to. When I’m comfortable. and if you dont fucking make me feel comfortable then DO U THINK I WILL TALK. and being comfortable is more than just being nice or like asking gently. it’s just knowing how to talk about it.

im not religious and she knows that and the therapist even told her don’t talk about religion with me but all she can do is scream at me and say that god says if i think i will live i will live but if i think i will die i will die and that im basically not doing enough. even though ive opened up to my therapist, my friends and my doctor",t2_1lp297ei,1,0

Because I want to make the world a better place? The universe has made it loud and clear. It’s telling me I can’t make the world a better place. There’s no point in trying. I’m not here to do that I am here to be tortured no matter what. Be happy? Torture indifferent? Torture. There is no hope. I hope I die soon because I’ve never felt this broken. I am truly numb and somehow that hurts even more.

Should I go to group therapy tomorrow? I’m terrified?,"
I’m 19. 

I started going to therapy last month because I thought I was bipolar. I see my therapist once a week. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder and social anxiety and seasonal depression. Not on any medication. There is a DBT group therapy of 6 girls (19-22 years old) that started at the end of February. The first meet was the 26th and then last Wednesday. With another therapist who I’ve never met. I didn’t show up at the last two (they didn’t put me on the list though so it didn’t matter but this week they did).

I currently don’t have a job or any friends (haven’t had friends or a job in months, can’t keep either). And i sit in my house most of the time or take my dogs for walks sometimes (but that causes anxiety if it’s crowded on the walking trail).

I am supposed to see my therapist Thursday and group is tomorrow and I got a group text message as confirmation that group is tomorrow and there’s other girls replying. I never said anything. Someone is bringing their cat and snacks for the group.

I’m scared there might be people I went to school with there at group (I was bullied a lot and virtually had no friends all 4 years and sat alone at lunch a lot, I have RBF so I guess that doesn’t help and a strong fight or flight response and tend to come off rude when I feel uncomfortable and I shut down). There is someone in the group named Rachel and I knew 3 Rachel’s that went to that school that absolutely hated my guts for no reason and made my life hell.  Idk if it’s her because I don’t know the last name. 

I’m also scared they are going to judge me (you know the looks on peoples faces to know they are judging you, that certain look and then the way they look at others after looking at you or if they start whispering) and won’t like me for whatever reason.

I’m having massive anxiety thinking about it, my therapist thinks it would be good for me to try it out so we can use some of what they teach me there in our 1 on 1 sessions and so I can potential try to make friends. She also told me about meet me.com meet ups and I’m too scared to do that, I don’t trust people and I hate driving. Driving gives me massive anxiety.

Hell going to the grocery store is a complete nightmare which is why my parents go most of the time for me. I always feel like people hate me.",t2_3ciycb9m,2,0
I feel like a side supporting character in everyone else's story.,"I have tried to hard to ""create my own story"" and every time it has failed, setback after setback after setback, inevitably I will try again, but I will always be overshadowed by people's success.

I hate not being remarkable, I hate having nothing to show, I feel useless in this world, all I ever wanted to do was make people happy (sounds like a horribly cliche Joker comparison, but there is no anger, just despondency and being jaded at life)

I still hold out on the hope that it will ""be my time"" and I will make something of a mark on the world.

I feel like I have been molded into someone who is destined to fail by people who wanted their own success.

I don't have a relationship, or a child, or my own home, my family and friends are always so busy.

Meeting my dad and my paternal grandparents for the first time.,"I am currently 20 years old and I have lived my entire life being raised by my mom and her family. For a long time I had no interest in seeing my dad but that changed last year when I found a letter from my grandma addressed to my mom from 2002! Since I was a kid my mom told me that my dad and his family didn't want anything to do with us because my dads side of the family said she was having an affair with her boss. The letter kinda shook me because I felt lied too by my family because it proved they did want to meet me. Things escalated when I took an ancestry DNA test seeing that I matched with one of my aunts on my dads side of the family and actually got a message from a second cousin on that side of the family and things have been escalating since and now I am talking with my first cousin who is trying to get me to go to the Easter dinner, but I don't know if I want to go or what I would even say to them.

Not having a dad in my life is something I always felt self conscious about and it was a source of a lot of my depression when I was younger. It turns out he lived in the same town me and mom lived in until I was 12! My mom was also sick for close to six years and he wasn't around for that and never made an attempt to reach out to me or my mom.  I can't go into all the details of this last year and some of the things my mom told me but right now I am feeling a mixture of joy, fear, anger, excitement, but mostly a deep sense of sadness. I am worried my dads side of the family won't like me and I was thinking I should just meet my grandparents cause I've learned my grandfather has stage 4 cancer and I want to at least meet him before he dies. It's a messy situation my mom thinks I should do it but I still don't know I recently lost my grandpa to a stroke and this might just be more stress in my life.

How do I tell my parents I’m struggling again?,"So, I went through a depressive/anxious episode in high school, during which I went on medication and attended therapy and eventually felt better. Now, I’m in my 4th year of college, and I’m starting to feel the same way, only now, I have the freedom to not go to class if I don’t feel well enough to attend. It has gotten to the point to where I am most likely going to fail all of my classes, and I’m too afraid of judgement to tell anyone I’m struggling. I feel like my parents think my depression/anxiety was a phase that I got over, so I’m too nervous/embarrassed to tell them that I’m struggling again, because I don’t want them to tell me that I’m just lazy or incompetent or that I have the tools to get me out of this hole. I also don’t have the money to attend therapy without my parents paying for it. Basically, how do I tell my parents I’m struggling with depression/anxiety again without them thinking that I’m just lazy or experiencing senioritis?

On the verge of despair.,"Hi everyone! Thanks for reading.

I have been battling depression my whole life, but lately it's been harder than usual.
I was on the verge of suicide about 2 weeks ago, even though I'd vowed never to do it (I have a child). But I felt so low and hopeless. I feel unloved, under appreciated, taken for granted. I feel stupid (as in intellectually inferior), and I am starting to doubt my ability to make reasonable decisions.

I was a smart kid, school was always easy and I alway had good grades. I was always interested in psychology and philosophy, but I also had a passion for the Arts (film, photography and painting). I chose the arts route and have a degree in Fine Arts. Best years of my life for sure, but that didn't put me on the path of a good paying job! I was delusional, thinking I'd somehow make it as an artist.

I have no self-esteem, no confidence as an artist, so that never took off. I'm 38 now and all the jobs I've had are in office administration. A year ago, I got my license in real estate and started working for a realtor as his executive assistant. Within 3 months he promoted me to associate realtor, meaning I get to show clients properties and write up contracts. However, I've made a lot of mistakes (which is normal), and I've lost 4 clients in the last 2 months, one of which just tonight, so I'm really starting to feel as though I'm not very good with people. 3 of those clients were leads I was trying to convert, I'd only exchanged a few emails after meeting them at open houses. I like to joke that they ""Broke up"" with me, or told me they were ""seeing other people"". But the one client I lost tonight was someone I'd built a relationship with. I'd shown her and her husband multiple properties and I felt as though we'd ""clicked"". Sadly her husband passed away 4 months ago and she's now realized she doesn't want to move to my city anymore (completely understandable). It's a shame because I was really looking forward to seeing her again, and to find her a home here. Also, I don't have many leads and I thought this one was solid. 
I know this one is not personal, but the other 3 said they decided to work with someone else, so that hurts.

I'm starting to wonder if it's because my energy is low that I'm repelling people? My boss hired me because he felt I attracted people, not the opposite, and it did work for 2019. 

I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose my job or quit. I don't feel capable of anything else. I don't want to go back to office work. I want to be an artist, but I am so hard on myself, I always think my art is mediocre at best.

I left my country and moved 6,000 miles, 7 years ago, to marry a man I fell in love with, we have a child together and own our house. Yet I feel utterly dissatisfied with my life. I feel useless. I miss my friends and family, I'm isolated. What a stupid idea it was to leave them!

My miserable life,"Hello,

I've been here for a couple days and finally decided to tell how bad and sad is my life.

First of all im french so sorry my writing is bad and i don't want to waste anyone time so don't force yourself to read my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything began when i was still in elementary school , i used to have anger problems when i was a kid, especially in school, i wasn't hurting anyone or anything like that but i used to be really mad about small things, at that time people in my school used to bully me and make fun of those anger problems and my look, i was still a kid this was a huge impact for me, everytime i go back to my house i used to cry and the only thing i wanted is to change school, sadly it did not happen but it got worst, i used to be kinda depressed at that time and i remenber trying to tell my parents and my sisters (i have 2 sisters who are older than me) but nothing, they all rejected me and didn't help at all, they we're just screaming at me or didn't care.

Years after i finally was in middle school, i changed quite a bit since my anger problems started to stop which made me happy because i thought that people would stop making fun of me cuz of it, but i was wrong actually it was worst, i was still getting bullied and even worse people started to beat me up for absolutely no reason, i was 12 years old at that time and i was thinking about suicide a lot, but after days of thinking i knew it wasn't the best idea to suicide, i was always alone most of the time or with some buddies that didn't really cared about me, those years we're rough but i managed to go into high school !

Before going in high school when it was summer, i was always crying before sleeping, i really didn't want people to bully me again. You aleardy know that i was wrong...

So yeah, first day in high school was pretty much normal, after a few days people never spoke to me and i didn't, im really shy for a guy, 1 or 2 months later when we started to know each others it started to be bad for me, i forgot to say that earlier but when i was 12 i also started to have a deep voice which occured people to make fun of it, that's what they were doing and of course they also started to beat me up, everyday its like that and i feel like this won't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my daily life in school, being a victim in front of everyone :/

Even when im home nothing good happens my parents always argue, and when i say always im not lying, basically every day they start to argue for dumb reasons, and i can't do anything about it, i aleardy tried but nothing happened.

I don't really do things in my life, im always bored and enjoy talking to people but people don't seems to enjoy me a lot, i aleardy helped some people in depression too but they never helped me too which made me think that im really nothing in this planet, i aleardy told my story to some people but some of them trashtalk me, i guess they don't like depressed people much :/

Other people don't care or they know how i feel but they rather use their time to talk with other people which i understand.

I'm still young i'm 17 and soon 18 but i just want to die quick, i'm not gonna commit suicide or anything but i'm just waiting for my time to come, i only listen to sad music everyday and do nothing just watching life through my window hoping someone talks to me, but no it never happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate my life, i hate violence and i hate using bad words, im sensitive for most of the people, i don't fight back im just a victim who does nothing and who is worthless, no one wants to help me the only thing that i can do is listen to music, cry and help other people instead of helping myself.

And that's basically it.

Sorry if it was long, sorry if i annoyed you, sorry if i'm a bad person, i think i don't deserve any love from anyone but myself, but even me cannot love myself, i just want to make people laugh, im smilling but deep inside is just tears and tears dropping down, im not attractive which i don't really care, i don't judge people from their looks, i'm just waiting...

i think my life is a waste,"I don’t know how long this is going to be, or if anyone will even read it. I just want to say some things because I think that maybe if I can say something out loud (or type it) then it might go away.

where do I start? about me?

I’m 20 years old, my birthday is in 2 days. I live with my girlfriend, but she pretty much hates me (at least it seems that way). I never met my dad, and the one side of family I *do* have doesn’t talk to me. I’ve been on my own since high school because my mom always treated me like shit and I couldn’t handle it anymore so I left. 

I don’t really know why I’m still here.

For the past year or so, my life has seemed to just kind of happen. I constantly feel like I’m a passenger in my own body while I watch everything around me go by. I feel like shit about it, but I don’t even have the energy or motivation to try to change it. I don’t know how. I don’t even know why it started. Was there a specific time when it did? Maybe it’s always been this way and I only became aware of it in the last year. I don’t know. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to be alive.

Why? Let me walk you through every day in my life. 

I wake up at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon after a combination of shitty sleep, bad dreams, and staying up too late. I lay in bed for another hour or so and stare at the wall and contemplate whether or not I should eat. Eventually I get up to pee and eat cereal. When I open the door to the bedroom, my girlfriend (sleeps in the living room) is usually mad about something and wants to take it out on me, so I deal with that for the next half hour. After I finally eat, I wind up back in bed on my laptop scrolling through the endless amounts of people who I can potentially work for on facebook or reddit (I do “freelance” design/ music because I’m not good at anything else). By about 7 to 9 I’ve found a way to make like 50 bucks or so for the day, and then I lay here, in bed, where I am right now, and think about how much I hate this. I think about going places and doing things that could entertain/ excite me, but then I remember I can’t afford it. “Oh, well I’ll just get a real job so I can have money for those things.” But then I realize I don’t have a car and nobody would give me a ride anyway - not because people aren’t nice enough to do that, I just don’t have any friends.  

So then, after a few hours of that, it’s about midnight or so, and I figure maybe watching some YouTube or looking at memes can take my mind off of things. And I’ll admit, it does, but it’s only temporary. Everything is temporary. Everything but the constant looming cloud in the back of my mind that reminds me that my entire life is probably going to be spent like this, and as far as I know, there’s nothing I can do about that. 

Every day in recent memory has been a repeat of the day before and I can’t break the cycle. I don’t know how. I feel helpless. I know it sounds like I feel bad for myself, but I really don’t. I feel like this is all I’ll ever have, and as much as that sucks, I guess I’ve accepted it. I figure if I’m 20 now, and life has sucked for the last 2 years, and the average life expectancy is 80, I’ll only have to do this all like 30 more times before I go out from natural causes. Either that or I can take care of it myself and save the time/ trouble. I bought a gun, I’m just too scared to do it right now because when I was 6, my mom’s girlfriend did the same thing. So there’s that keeping me from doing it, and there’s a small part of me doesn’t want it to be this way. I just don’t know how to get out.

By the way if you don’t want to read all that, long story short: I have no money, I have no car, my girlfriend hates me, my family hates me, I have no friends, and every day of my life sucks. I have no motivation and no energy. I don’t even know where that stuff is supposed to come from anymore.

I don’t know what happened to me. I used to have dreams and aspirations but they died out over time and now I have nothing to look forward to. Since I was little I always wanted to be a big and famous musician, which, I know, is a stupid expectation. But it was always what I wanted to do in life. So I started playing guitar and singing when I was 8, and I was sure that was going to be my way of life. Slowly, when I grew up, I realized how unrealistic and dumb that was, but at that point, it was too late. I was about 18 when that hit me. 

Maybe that’s when it all started - when I was little. I mean, I had no role models in my family/ life in general, so the only places I found inspiration from then were the artists I looked up to. I mean, that lifestyle seemed so much more appealing than being a middle-aged single parent who didn’t want the kid in the first place (mom), a 70 year old alcoholic who is still bitter over a wife that left half my life ago (grandpa), or a 65 year old pillhead who makes money by lying to the government and getting disability checks to fund my pill addiction more (grandma).

&amp;#x200B;

I know this all seems like I’m finding everyone else but myself to blame for this, and maybe that *is* what I’m doing, but I literally have no other idea what it could be. My dreams died out before I could even reach them and now I’m just stuck. I’m stuck here. In this house. In this relationship. On this computer. On this planet. 

I need to know if things can get better, and if they can, how the fuck do I start?",t2_16svbtup,3,0

"I want to be ok, I can't hide it anymore.","Last year I witnessed someone commit suicide at a train station, I didn't know the person but it has really fucked with me. It has been hard to talk about (i haven't even talked about it much) but it feels easier to talk about it compared to opening up about my depression. I have been struggling for 3 years and haven't told anyone. I don't know why but it feels as if I don't have a valid reason to be depressed, and I haven't told anyone for this reason. I just say I'm fine because I don't want to bother other people with my problems and I feel like I am just being annoying. It is easier to talk about what I witnessed because people expected it to mess with me but I still feel as if no one cares except my family. They have helped me so much and I am going to open up to them tomorrow over a phone call. I want to tell my friends as well but I feel as if they don't care. I've missed lectures and one of my friends asked if I was alright yesterday but he has been ignoring my messages for the past couple of days (he would leave my messages unopened but he would half-swipe them on Snapchat) and he didn't open my message saying it was sort of because of the anxiety so I deleted it. I haven't talked to anyone properly for a few days. It has been really hard recently and all I have done I lay in bed for 4 days whereas normally I can function and hide it. I don't want to exist but I would never kill myself because of my family. I want things to be ok. I feel so alone.

Why do I love the wrong people,"I seem to fall in love with the wrong people, but not in your usual ""they treat me badly""; they are wrong for me because:
1st they never, ever love me back.
2nd, loving these people and my feelings going public always imply a huge sabotage to my personal life for some reason.

I want it to stop, as if I don't have enough problems to deal with, I also have to deal with the fact that even though I find people with whom I can feel like myself for just 5 minutes, I can never ever be with them due to either of those 2 reasons mentioned above.

"Frustrated by the phrase ""happiness is a choice""","I don't subscribe to the idea that anyone who has truly suffered a depressive episode actually believes that happiness is a choice. The implication of that phrase is that victims are *choosing to suffer*. It's victim blaming at its very core. We can't choose our thoughts any more than we can choose the weather. Happiness is a not a switch that can be flipped at will, but every time I hear ""happiness is a choice"", I only start to think that something must be wrong with me because I can't find the switch. But of course I can't find the switch, because **there is no switch**. Negative thoughts are intrusive and undesired--they appear without our consent, and we have to actively fight them. That takes effort, and sometimes a *lot* of it.

The only thing I think we can choose is our actions; or rather, choose where we apply effort. That can take the form of just doing a little bit of work in our daily lives (making your bed, folding your clothes, cleaning your room, etc.), but in the end, we still only get to choose to apply effort *in spite* of unhappiness. We don't choose unhappiness.

I'm curious if anyone feels differently, though. What is your take on the phrase ""happiness is a choice""? Do you agree or disagree?",t2_alwbh,669,0
Appreciation Needed,"My husband doesn't appreciate that even though I've felt suicidal (Mostly passive wishing I was dead, but was thinking about stuff I'd like to say in a note and how to get my pet to my parents without them knowing the reason why so a little active) I've been doing chores and trying to make the house livable. He doesn't appreciate that when he's depressed I help him do actual self care behaviors like helping him have a clean environment, but when I'm depressed he doesn't do any of that. Last night he said if I don't change he's going to divorce me in a year. I want a divorce so badly but I can't afford to be divorced. I wanted to make my house a home, now it feels like a prison.

Ignore this post.,Nothing makes me feel better than being productive. Whether it be creating or working or just doing menial tasks it gives the moment meaning. At night all of that goes away. After about 10 o’clock I’m bombarded with difficult thoughts I’m forced to process. Life is unfair and I’m forced into this cycle of living for life. It’s impossible to just exist. I have to force myself to want to. These thoughts are cause for insomnia and most of the time I have trouble sleeping. When I’m intoxicated it easier. All I want to be is subdued. I don’t want to process what life actually is I just want to enjoy it. I get into this habit where I’m drinking/smoking myself to sleep which is honestly fantastic. The only thing that makes life worth living is when I forget that I’m living. I’d rather live in a cartoon or book where there’s a happy ending. I’m so desperate for someone to care. I hate being the “depressed” person so I never share it but honestly I’m lonely. So lonely. I’m tearing up as I write this. I feel like having someone would be the strongest drug I can get.

"Just ruined a friendship, no fire to keep building my business, I get up and do stuff but it feels pointless, idk maybe someone can spark something to help.","Hey guys/gals. I have been having a rough couple months. At this point I have started taking the steps I know I need to do just to try to work on this. I am going to be going to bed at 10/10 30 every night, wake up at 6, work put/eat till 7 and then get ready and be in my office by 8. I am giving up video games till at least the end of the month and trying to do more social events all to try to break this cycle. But at the same time I feel like I am just going through the motions because it's what I need to do to build my business and hit my goals, but I don't have any drive, any passion, or really any feeling (other than occassionally feeling motivated or at peace) other than sadness, anger and loneliness and it feels like I am just going through the motions.

I ended a 2 year relationship in october because I didn't see myself being with her down the road. Then I started dating my boss in November and after 2.5 months we separated. Around this time I really started to notice my depression was kicking in and we were still trying to be friends. it was killing me seeing her every day and my mind was making my emotions go haywire and today the straw broke the camel's back and she said she couldn't handle it anymore and we can't be friends she can only be my manager.

The past few months I have been building my financial advisor practice yet have been working without a paycheck. Luckily my parents just offered to support my Bill's the next couple months because I have some clients coming in and things are moving forward slowly but surely so finances aren't a huge issue. But at the same time I am always beating myself up for not being perfect, I am being super negative and critical of myself and even though I love what I do for people, love the meeting with clients part and how financially rewarding this can be, it's a grind that I need to get up and fight to see people every day and I sometimes just don't have the energy.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no one I can lean on because I am always just too much of a burden, I feel like I'm just on a time till I get to the point I can't prove myself anymore, but I also can't go back to a 9-5 boring ass job that won't allow me the same financial freedom and work life balance this one can provide.

Idk, my hope with posting this is something will be said that might spark something for me to just give me the strength to push on. But that's my rant for the day.

Help,"I have been completely normal and high functioning my whole life, no past history of abuse, struggle, or mental illness in me or my family. A little over a month ago, I realized I was sweating profusely, and my sex drive was gone (very uncommon for me). It got worse when, at school, I could feel my heart pounding through my chest. I went to the nurse and my blood pressure had skyrocketed(160/80), yet my heart rate was very low (41 bpm). My BP is concerning because I play sports and exercise often, and eat a healthy diet. It has remained steadily above 130/60 since. Soon after, I started having severe panic attacks at least once a day. And I have never even had to deal with stress before. As crazy as it sounds, I get completely convinced that my life is over when I have a panic attack. My brain feels like it’s being squeezed and I have no control over it. I don’t think I’ve ever cried throughout the past 4 years, but these past 5 weeks I’ve cried more than I have in my life. I am constantly worried and in despair over absolutely nothing. I’ve lost all appetite for sex and food ( I’ve lost 20 pounds without even paying attention). My eyes have become oddly puffy throughout the day. Another very odd thing is the migraines I’ve been getting. I’ve never once in my life experienced a migraine, but I’ve been getting them left and right recently.

Coronavirus screwed literally all of my plans this summer/year,"Granted, not many were super huge plans, but it was something.

My state declared an emergency today after we got five new cases yesterday. Schools have panicked and cancelled all field trips for everyone in the county, so I'm pissed off about that. My summer internship I applied for is likely to get cancelled because it's through the school, and my internship starting in August will probably be cancelled too. The cruise ship, while not cancelled, my family has decided not to go. According to my father, we're no longer going to travel anywhere for my 16th birthday this September. I just started a babysitting business and if the virus spreads too much by the summer I won't be able to babysit (which is the only way I make money + I really like it).

And that's just the things that I can name off the top of my head. If I think long and hard I betcha I can come up with a ton more. 

This virus is she stupidest thing ever. Literally the worst possible thing for a person with depression who's actually trying to make themselves feel better for once. I was so excited to get out and do something other than video games this year/summer, and THIS happens.

I dont think I'm depressed but what should I do?,"lately, I have been feeling down for no reason. I don't know why and can't even explain it but I just am. While talking to a friend I realized that I don't do anything that makes me happy and could really use a hobby or something. The thing is, where do I start my search of something that I don't know. Again, I don't think I'm depressed as I often feel happy and content but recently I have had trouble doing the most basic of things. I'm posting this here cause I know many of you are probably experienced with mental health and maybe have some good suggestions.",t2_2p5tozu4,1,0
I've been feeling so depressed lately and I can't find the time or space to heal,"I've (21 M) been depressed for a while now. If I were asked where I thought it would stem from I'd say its my childhood &amp; family.

I grew up in a pretty well off family, enough money for needs to be taken care of. But that's it. Growing up, I didn't really speak to my parents. I was practically raised by my grandparents up until my grandma died (father side). Then everything took a turn for the worst. I had to go back and live with my parents. My dad is abusive both physically and emotionally, my mom is the type to throw people under the bus to save herself from my dad. My mom got into trouble a lot because of the stupid things she'd do for fun. Example: my mom would go to the mall, if my dad found out he'd start screaming. My mom would then pin the blame on me by saying I wanted food from somewhere so she went to get it (i didn't ask for anything, I don't even talk to my parents) then my dad would direct his anger to me and Id get punished for it. (punishments ranged from getting the belt on the mouth all the way to walking to some place nude, they could get pretty inhumane and they get worse). My brothers and sisters are the type to hide even when they know that what i was being accused of wasn't true. In our family, no one defended each other. and shit gets worse. When I was grade 6 I was stopped being provided with money for food and clothes (but my siblings still got) so I had to work. at one point they stopped providing for my education (while they were funding my siblings and bought a ticket to fly out except me) so I had to fund myself. 

Apart from family, my social life was a little better but enough trauma to fuck me up. I was a relatively fat kid who was often bullied in school. I'm not that bright, nor am I physically gifted. I had a a few neighbors I was close to though, so that brought me a lot of comfort knowing I'd still be fine since I have a few friends I could turn to.  FF to our adolescent years 3/8 people in our circle of friends died by suicide. And that hit all of us hard to the point where we don't know where each other is or what they're doing anymore. Just heard recently one of them died by suicide too so that makes it 4/8

My granddad became my scapegoat. He'd help me escape from my family. I would just stay in his room and talk with him and maybe play chess while he keeps me company as late as he can keep me before he lets my parents take me home. however upon entering college he got a stroke so I don't have that safety anymore.

I tried running away. I tried buying my own apartment. They intervened with the contractors, companies, and persons and stopped them. I tried buying a one way ticket to some other country. They had airline connections and stopped me from being able to board and had my passport cancelled. I tried going to a forest so that I cant be found. They asked the local government help to track me down and had a search team look for me. When i get home, same thing. I'd get beaten &amp; abused ( I have marks all over my body that I always cover up so that people wouldn't see). No treatment change whatsoever. 

I'm in 5th year college now  ( 4 year course but had to slow it down to make time to earn money) and I'm still pretty much going through hell. I have to deal with my parents abuse at home, I have to work to pay tuition (sometimes my brothers' too) and rent (my own parents is making me pay rent for the house they bought and live in) bills and my grandfathers medical bills (my dad refuses to pay his share and ended up making me pay for it). And the current hell I'm living in, I see no end in sight. I keep trying to get some space to heal but I can't get that space or time because when I think I have the space and chance to, something mad happens.

I'm pretty much in the shits right now and don't know what to do. I've contemplated suicide several times already and it's becoming more and more a very appealing option as time passes. The past 2 attempts I had, a guard found me and stopped me forcefully.

My question now is, what makes life so great that its worth living until the end? Because as things stand, I don't see anything worth staying longer for.

TLDR: Im depressed and want to die already. Whats a good reason not to die even when the whole  duration of being alive I was suffering",t2_2mv6d1oy,3,0
Lonely. Unwanted man,"So throughoit the last few years i've started to feel more lonely, more depressed, sometimes even suicidal. I'd say that last 2years have been the toughest. So i've had friends all my life. Some have come and some have left. Few have stayed, but 2years ago i was having the best time of my life. During the summer i got really close with a girl. I hadnt had a relationship before that and unfortunately it didnt become my first one either. I was hanging out with alot. We went shopping, out to have a dinner etc. The way she was acting made me feel like we have something although she had said sometime before that she would never have a relationship with me. But when the summer ended she got a boyfriend and disappeared for me. I tried contacting her through messenger but the answers were short and meaningless. So i was like okey, thats wierd. I thought that maybe after some time she will start chatting again but no. During that time a lot of my friends were getting into relationships and i was the odd one out. No matter what i tried i would never get a girl to like me more than a friend. And believe me i tried many times. I workout, i go out(although many times i feel very lonely), i drink reasonably, i have a stable income, im really friendly, im told i have a big heart and its in the right place, i underatand humour of every caliber. But it seems that im just ugly, or not rich enough, that im a virgin, that i dont have experience. Every girl that i have been interested in hasnt shown any interest in me. The way that they talk to me is so much different to my friends, alot different. Every one of my friends, parents, grandparents just keeps asking where is your girlfriend, and saying that time is ticking(im 22). I understand their concerns beacause im concerned about it aswell. Funny thing about it all is that every close friend that is in a relationship is thanks to me. I brought them together with they girlfriends. Now they go on doubledates and im basically left to be alone. They have invited me and i have joined(thirdwheeling) them but everytime it has been very awkward for me and very depressing and lonely. And it seems that im destined to be alone, destined to help other and its eating me from inside, it has become unbearable to the point that i have been feeling suicidal. Nothing makes me happy anymore...

I’m so tired,"I’m so tired of thinking this way, I’m so tired of not being able to sit in my room without having a breakdown, I’m so tired of failing, im tired of the panic attacks, I’m tired of feeling lonely, im tired of the self harm, I’m so tired of being so suicidal all the time. No one notices my contorted and down expressions that obviously show I am not okay, but everyone ignores it.

I'm gonna die soon... but I do not want to.,"Hello everyone,

I finda kinda weird to explain my personal history, but I do not know what the fuck to do.

I was born in a normal family. Not rich, not poor. An overprotective mother made me kinda insecure about things. I always have been little, yet really agressive as a child, plus having a huge self demand on myself.

I live in a hard country to grow up. I was bullied all my entire life. When I was 12, I was bullied or ridiculized by everyone in my class. They put spiders on my desk (I am afraid of them), they kick the shit outta of me, they throw away my food always.

I was the ""bullied smart guy"" of the class, but I get sick of it; in my teenage years I started to ""try to be"" the cool kid that goes with the ""cool guys"", but I ended being a weird sidekick, that still was bullied by a lot of people. Nothing weird though. Not responded love on my teenage years, and shit like this.

But I slowly started to develop a depression. I think in my 15-16 I started to feel weird. You know, shit like that. Not like ""ugh, life is sad, I feel depressed"", just a bad chemical reaction on my brain. Thing was going shitty, but I could take it.

Then, everything was going downhill (like at 17-19). I was pretty OK in martial arts (I was stopped being bullied too, lol), but I suffered a lot of injuries; I had to stop. I had my first girlfriend... yet, she commited suicide. I started university, yet all my friends only were one course with me. Some of my best friends just dissapeared of my life from one year to the other; others, just fall in ""bad life"" (drugs, problems).

Then, at 20ish my father died, just without any context. He was a special man, a good, humble, charming and really inteligent man. I love you so much dad. I fuckin' miss you, and I know that with you everything would be great.

With my dad alive, everything was kinda ok. At least I have my family; I was raised a lot of times with my granny, and I had a special connection with my little cousin (she was like my daughter, she only has her momma, and I am the only man on the family), as when she was born I was like 18 years old or so.

My dad died of stress, but everything was fucked up from there on: all my family turned my back on me and my mom because of the fuckin' money. I had no side to choose, as I had no money and I was living with my mother... and yet my mother started to blame my father for all the troubles. My mother, some one that almost did not work in her entire life, started to say bad things about a man that DIED because of his stressfull work (he was a police chief, and those night-shifts are mortal).

But gladly, I still had connections, things to go on. I had university, I had a girlfriend, then I had work, then I had sports again...

Yet things went really ugly, again. I finished university, I started to work, I get a new girlfriend, I started to do sports again... but everything ended.

My ex broke with me, and she doesn't wanna know ANYTHING about me. All because I was a closed guy, because I do not want to ""paint dark days in her beauty life"". I am desperately wanting to at least ""end everything in a good way"", yet I am a fuckin monster in her eyes.

At my hobbies, I couldn't train for months because of my late depression. And I see everyone getting better, and I am just getting stuck, and everyone surpassing me. And I am just a letter in a book, an ant in a colony.

And by work, yeah, my work is kinda stressful. I am the director in a company, yet I suffer from pressure from the ""ground workers"" and from my superiors. It is cool that I do not have to go to a normal 40h job, yet that kind of solitude kills me.

Just imagine my life;

In circa five years,

\- I lost my girfriend due to suicide

\- I do not have any friend because either they are too afraid when I open my ""pandora box"", or they go away because I am a closed human being.

\- When I asked for help to my family because of my mental problem, a lot of stigmas were into me

\- I was locked into a mental health hospital for months with 20 years

\- I lost my father

\- I was thinking to form a family with my exgirlfriend (3 years together), yet she dumped me because almost no reason

\- I lost all my family, only I have a manipulative mother and her stupid snob boyfriend. She is just a fucktoy to a rich man.

\- Everyone that I knew is against me. Even my mother talk bad things about me.

\- I have a fucked up brain.

&amp;#x200B;

And I could go on, and on, and on... but the hardest thing is that I could be one, two, three days, weeks or even months without sayin' anything and no one would make me a call. No one would come to my house and hug me. No one would smile at me, say something nice without wanting anything in to return.

It's not just my mental health. It's not only my shitty live. It's that nobody really cares.

It's the fact that, why I should fight?

Why I have to struggle with all this, everyday?I have NO ONE on my side. No one to talk, no one to hang out, no one to go to the cinema. No one to have fun, no one to eat some day. And that counting if I would like to.

Someday, my life is gonna end. And I know it it gonna be kinda soon, yet I do not want. I cry to sleep a lot of nights, because my mental pain, because my life... and because I am scared to die.  


Yet, there is no cure. I cannot hide all my past, all the pain. I cannot hide all my mental problems. 

What the fuck I am supposed to do? 

Hi Ted, yeah let's hang out. Ohhh  so you are sad because your dog is ill? Well, today, 5 years ago my girlfriend commited suicide, and 10 years ago some jerk in my high school broke all my teeth and was applauded by my entire class. Ah besides that, I might be a psycho and I have depression and anxiety, ALL FUCKIN GOOD TED",t2_5wg6w7p9,1,0
I ruined it,"**Forewarning, I have ZERO relationship experience, I made this clear to her in advance, but I cant help but think that I did or said something that caused the wrong idea.**

I met the **most amazing woman of the face of the Earth about two months ago. She is super sweet, kind, smart, funny, drop-dead gorgeous, and a dream to spend time with.** We originally met just to hookup, however we connected and she became an amazing friend. **By far the best thing to ever happen to me in my entire life**, no question. We weren't bf/gf, **we were us**, no labels. We hung out, went on dates, explored the city, and generally just spent time together, and it was so fun and felt so good. Anyway, the other day I received a text from her that she thinks we shouldn't see each other anymore, that things were going too fast and she wasn't comfortable or ready for it. Two hours before this she responded to a cute meme I sent her that was a ""cuddle coupon"" and she said she would be using it a lot. How it goes complete 180 turn in such a short time, **FUCK MY LIFE**. Frankly I'm devastated, I never intended to rush anything, in fact I was more than content being friends. I can't help but feel that I did something or said something that ruined it, and **I hate myself for causing the end of the best thing that has ever happened to me**. I feel like I was being toxic or asking for too much without realizing it. I am in so much pain. Now I am planning on improving myself, mainly to try and numb the pain, also hoping that our paths cross once again. **I place no blame on her, if she thinks its over, then I guess its over**, I respect her feelings. But god I feel so bad and miss her so much, **I'm afraid to sleep at night because I dream about her and feel even worse**. I cant focus on work, or family or anything, I've basically been crying nonstop. I feel like such a baby and such a burden. ""Why would she want to hang out with me anyway?"" I think to myself. Its so fucking painful. **I was truly, genuinely, happy for once in my life and now its over.** I fucking ruined it.  **I would do anything to be friends with her once again.** Her birthday is coming up and I think I'm gonna send her a card, which is probably the stupidest fucking thing imaginable, but I want to do it anyway. Well yeah, I kinda just wanted to vent, but I'm interested to hear about what yall think too.

Dependent on cannabis for depression,"I have been diagnosed with depression and as the title suggests, am dependent on cannabis for my depression. I have lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, feel completely empty, and spend the vast majority of my days lying in bed or on my computer trying to force myself to enjoy something to take the boredom away. I struggle to get out of the house, and I use cannabis daily, most of the time multiple times a day, and its the only thing in the world that seems to take the depression away and give me clarity. Alongside cannabis i also use nicotine to ease the pain a bit.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on medication for depression, and the meds I am currently taking have helped a lot, but they can only do so much. I have been on a multitude of different meds to try and combat depression but the only thing that can consistently help is cannabis. The only problem I have is that cannabis is expensive and I use it as a severe crutch to the point where i don't know what I would do without it.

Please help..,"First post here, because I don’t know where else to turn to. I’m a 31yo man serving in the military, who’s going through the worst period in my life. I’ve been suffering from depression since my ex-fiancé left me back in 2015. 

So here’s my story: 

My most recent gf (LDR) just broke up with me on Saturday. We were only together for 3 months, and half of that was extremely rocky due to my own fuck up. However, I knew almost immediately this was someone I could spend my life with. The first week we spent together was the greatest relationship experience I’ve ever had. If we had worked out, I already was very open to leaving the military, moving to her country, and being able to get a fresh start on life that I desperately need. 

I thought the breakup was a good idea at the time, but now that it’s hit me, all I want is to have back what we used to have. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to have anything that good ever again in my life. I’m on day two of no contact, and it’s eating me up inside. I honestly don’t know how to recover from this, and it’s affecting me worse than the loss of an 8 year relationship with my ex fiancé. I used the gym as a coping method with her, but now I’m recovering from a shoulder injury so that’s not an option. 

Now I feel like my life is in shambles. I lost the only person I looked forward to talking to every day, I lost the chance for a fresh start in a new country, I don’t have many close friends, I don’t have any hobbies and no ambition to acquire any, I’m not happy in my career but don’t have any idea what else I would do outside of it. All I do on a regular day is watch Netflix and sit in silence with my cats and smoke weed (legal for military here). 

I’m currently deployed for the next 2.5 weeks, staying just 5 minutes from where she lives. I have limited access to my mental health resources back home, so I don’t really know who to talk to. I don’t really have many friends I’m comfortable turning to, and I don’t like taking to my family about these issues. I just feel like I literally have nothing left in life. I still want to leave the military, but now I have nothing to look forward to after it. I have no interest in any other career field, I don’t want to go back to school, but I don’t want to take a massive pay cut and settle for a shit job. 

I’m not suicidal per se, but if I could push a button to poof out of existence, I wouldn’t think twice about it. I just want all the pain to be over. 

TLDR; recently broken up with, and I feel like I have nothing left in life.",t2_btuys,2,0

Always think about death,"I feel like for years, with no exaggeration I have always thought about dying. Lately it’s not necessarily sad. I’m not crying or anxious, there’s really no emotional connection with it. Just the fact that I’m like “I wonder if I’ll die today”. Kind of like when you’re waiting for an important text from someone that you’re not sure will ever come. I’m anticipating it. I have really “bad” intrusive thoughts about it or ill just repeat in my head “I want to die”. It’s like an obsession. Everything is just really overwhelming and my automatic safe haven is just thinking it will be over soon. Is there a word for this? Is it suicidal ideation? But I’m not really suicidal I just wonder if/ hope God will do his part soon.",t2_2b0g7yb2,1,0
I feel like I'm faking it all as an excuse to be mean.,"   I've not got an actual diagnosis for depression but I kind of think I may have it. But I'm a minor, so it's probably just stupid teenage angst. My parents don't really care, and I assume they're right. I mean, they've know I've been ""depressed"", self harming, and suicidal for years now and they haven't done anything. The best they've done is Dad stole my knife like two days ago. So it's definitely nothing. I just wish I could get over myself and stop causing my family more pain than necessary.    
    
   I don't know if I can though. It's nice to think I am depressed. That I have an excuse to be so lazy, so annoying, and so self pitying. My family hates how much of a martyr I am. I've been actively stopping them from punishing me. Hiding my stuff so they can't take it/throw it out a window. Being completely dismissive when they shout at me for the fifth time in two days. I'm really mean to them because a part of me feels like I have a right to be when they've ignored my ""depression"" and not helped me. But I do logically know I don't. That I'm just being cruel and borderline abusive.  
  
   So, yeah. My dad says he's kicking me out of his house (my parents are separated) tonight and I should find somewhere else, but I've already pissed my mum off so she won't want me. I think with this, coupled with my fake depression, the best way for me to stop being so cruel and feeling so bad is to just kill myself soon. I just wish my dad would leave the house so I could be alone.

Getting Ghosted Sucks,"I was talking to this girl on a dating app and we really hit things off well. We were talking for a while and planned on meeting up for a movie at my place over the weekend and suddenly Friday afternoon she cancelled saying she had to go home as her mother was having surgery. This was not a lie and I know she was telling the truth and I wished her best of luck and said we'd reschedule. 

We talked for a bit during Saturday across both the dating app and Snapchat / Instagram. Suddenly I see she unfriended me on Snapchat and asked her why. She said it was an accident and that she doesn't really use snapchat anyways. I thought nothing of it because she seemed genuine but a lot of my female friends said it was a huge red flag and that a lot of effort is involved in unfriending someone on snapchat. 

I gave her some space and was going to hit her up today and ask how her mother was an suddenly she's vanished. She's nowhere in my conversation list on the dating app and blocked me on instagram and snapchat. Literally out of nowhere. 

I can't imagine why she felt the need to do me like that and if I was genuinely bothering her I wish she could have been honest about it instead of just ""accidentally"" unfriending me then blocking me a few days later. It really sucks because I've been in need of someone to cuddle with for the longest time - not even looking for sex and I made that clear.

I haven’t been happy for years,"I just can’t feel happy anymore. I constantly try to fake it by reflecting my friend’s happiness, but I personally cannot feel happy anymore. All I ever feel is varying levels of anger or nothing at all.

I will never find love (something I’ve been forced to accept under the knife since I’m too weak mentally, physically, and emotionally for anybody) and I scarcely make friends (it’s closer to people whose company I tolerate more than other people, as I personally don’t care about a soul on the planet including my family).

I constantly have horrid thoughts directed at either myself or others that I struggle to suppress daily, and crave nothing more than to suffer punishment through pain or death but do not have the courage to do anything myself.

My future is completely dead since I’m stuck in a college I can not afford because of my grandparents that won’t allow me to “waste my life” by not going to school (despite the fact that I don’t have any plans to live past 25) and all my backup plans involve being involved in some sort of criminal scheme since I know that standard working will just cause me to suffer even more. At least with crime I can buy drugs or something before I get shot and die rather than wilt away in a broken rocking chair growing even more resentful than I already am.

I think I was born depressed,"Before, I often used to wish so badly to go back to older happier memories when I was a kid. I held my past on a type of pedestal, only remembering the “better” me. Recently I found one of my notebooks from the third grade and looked through it. It was filled with scribbles describing everything I hated about myself. It repeated every negative or hurtful thing others have said to me and on almost every other page I wrote that I wanted to die. Then memories came flooding a back to me, and I remember that I was rarely ever happy then either. All my happy memories were the few times I felt ok then. I think I was meant to be sad honestly.",t2_4ttwl7fn,2,0

My wife and I are having marital issues as a result to me “not having any emotions” all the time. This has been an ongoing issue for over a year now, and I’ve tried to change for her but I just don’t get any joy out of anything. I don’t talk to anyone, I just observe and analyze facts rather than poor my feeling into anything. I’ve struggled with this feeling almost all my life, but lately it seems to be consuming me, and now affecting the one that I love.

"Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends.","I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...

I just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Anyone heard of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED)?,"Hi, first time posting. I’m a 24yo guy. I’ve had major depressive for years after having prolonged depression (I believe that’s what it’s called?) for years before that.

Wondering if anyone here has issues with seemingly random outbursts of aggression and irritability. Mine happen like clockwork about once a month and I get into a screaming match with my fiancé and then start talking about self-harm and breaking up and whatnot and then after I’ve said all my bullshit, I feel a little relief and calmness but then a lot of embarrassment and regret because I’ve said and done things I normally wouldn’t think of saying or doing. I have never and would never hit my fiancé or another human being, but I have gotten slightly rougher than necessary with a cat we own (she’s fine, and I obviously know I shouldn’t be doing that. I just get so irritable sometimes that any tiny thing the cat does sets me off and I swat at her).

Obviously don’t have enough knowledge to diagnose myself with anything but I have already been diagnosed with MDD, and I obviously do have symptoms of irritability with my depression. Just wondering if anyone else has issues with something similar or can offer literally any insight at all.",t2_ebc9c7,4,0

The thing is, recently I had a breakdown and because of it I decided to isolate myself from others.

I know I’m lucky, I have lots of people that care for me, but I don’t know what to do. Being like this feels much better but having your best friend ask you “What’s wrong?” with tears on her eyes and only being able to come up with “I just want to be alone” is horrible.

"Things have objectively never been better, but I am tired.","I moved, changed jobs, have a great boss and an amazing new hometown. But I also have ongoing struggles with brain injuries that I have been fighting for years to get treated for, and which got dramatically worse after an accident last summer. I’m normally extremely active and every part of my life has been limited by this pressure in my head that I can’t get anyone to address. TBI doc says neurology, neurologist says TBI doc. Everyone sees this apparently fit person because I’ve been eating very carefully, but they don’t know what I used to look like or how restricted I am. It’s frustrating being pressured to join them for runs, surfing, anything. Even getting up early to work out; it is physically painful in the mornings if I still need more sleep and I have to prioritize that. I’m military so there’s particularly high pressure to be active and not a lot of understanding when I look okay. I can’t drink anymore. I can’t do anything or be anywhere that will raise the pressure in my head, and I suffer from migraines on a daily basis, as well as some other physical issues I don’t feel like I can focus on right now. I also have PTSD, which overlaps and complicates things, though I don’t know exactly where or how. I do know I am triggered by these symptoms and dealing with doctors. 

Last week I had a procedure done and had a negative reaction that caused my system to crash. While they were working on me I felt like I was forcing myself to breath and thought, maybe this is my out. Maybe I can stop fighting and just drift away. I let go for a couple seconds but the pain kept me awake. I realize now the doctors wouldn’t have let that happen anyway. But I don’t have a strong connection to being alive. I don’t want to kill myself, but I’m ambivalent about being alive. I don’t have family and I don’t feel close enough to anyone who wouldn’t negatively impact my career. I’m hoping just talking here will help.

School is the one (homework), that is mostly restraining me from doing what I'd like to do to escape reality and be happy even if it's just a little. I just started crying just as I wrote about my medical problems because of the following: My parents already have spent over 1500$ for my teeth correction, that is still hard to maintain. If my gynaecomastia turns out to be perma, then the surgery will cost us 3000$+. Lumbar lordosis takes 1-3 years to fix with everyday exercise. I really want to hang myself.

into depression I isolate myself by exaggerating the flaws in my relationships with friends/family and using those as justification to distance myself from them. As I become more isolated I tend to perceive neutral gestures as more hostile. Everyone is percieved as the enemy. From an evolutionary perspective I guess that sorta makes sense. If a cave person were to be separated from their tribe they would be very vulnerable and it would be advantageous to percieve more interactions as threatening as isolation world mean constant danger.

I'm 25, have a dead-end part-time job and started going to college almost 2 years ago. I'm studying a short career related to IT, something like a bachelor degree. And in my free time I study programming to, to complement the career.

I feel like I wasted my life between 18, when I graduated high school, and 23, when I realized the mistake I was doing, and that my life was going nowhere.

Last year I was excited, I finally started going to college, I would make some friends there as I was quite a loner. Finally get a good job to move out and finally be independent, etc etc.

At the begging it was nice, talked to people, finally doing something with my life. Made a few ""friends"" in college, started to visit some extended family and made more friends, which invited me to clubs, to go out and experience thing I never did. Finally lost weight, started going to the gym, started running, to be healthy in general.

But then I struggled with some classes, mostly maths. After some months the ""friends"" I had dropped out or changed classes. I'm shy, and have some problems making friends so classes started to be quite lonely too.

I felt that I was ready to find some jobs related to IT so I started looking for them. Had a bunch of interviews, was the first time I had to deal with something like that. To compete with more people for a job, to promote myself, to interact with a lot of people. But I did fine I think, with some bumps here and there. 

In the meantime I got to know a girl in a family event, their family is friends with one of our relatives. Event though I'm really bad at being social, I decided to ask my friend to help me, as some sort of ""wingman"", to give my number to her and If she wanted we could start to know each other.

As my intentions were somewhat clear, I think it was easier for my to talk with her. I'm really bad with girls, as I went to an almost all boys high school, and have little to no experience with them.

Things went well, It was like I was another person. We went to a few dates, had some ups and downs but I think we are doing fine. She said she really likes me and, and I really like her too.

I feel like I don't deserve her, she is younger than me and started college like 1 year ago too. She is a nice girl,active, social,  sweet, family oriented and has her own hobbies and life. Its's like the opposite of me, I feel inadequate. But I want to be a good match, a good man. To be someone who deserves her.

But I'm still struggling, still got no full-time job. In one interview I did well and got a second interview which I did fine too. They called me because and told me that I was selected, and I had to do some medical studies, and some other things to be hired. I did everything they asked me to, they said everything was fine and that they would contact me again to tell me  the  work start date. I was really happy at that time, but this was like 3 moths ago, they told me they had some difficulties with the projects I was supposed to be working with, and barely keep me updated. I passed some opportunities waiting for them, and I feel like a moron, frustrated, disappointed. So in the meantime I looking for another job in the field again, and have an interview in some days. Not the best offer but I need something.

I feel like time is passing, that I'm going to reach a point of no return. That it's going to be too late for me.

I know that I started late, and it really makes me anxious when I see how some friends progressed and how far they are.

These past few weeks, as we haven't started classes yet, Ive been feeling down. Low energy, tired, started to eat like crap, not going to the gym and not running. Feels like all its going down.

I dont want to feel like this, I want to be excited about life again. To be active, to finally work, I want to go to classes and feel useful, that I'm not wasting my time.

Everyone says find a hobby.,"So I taught myself to play the piano. I can’t stop, it’s like a fixation. It’s all I want to do now. I never thought I would be able to play a song beyond Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. But it’s been a few weeks and I’m playing songs that sound beautiful to me. They may not be very hard songs or much of a real accomplishment, but I’m proud of myself. It’s inexplicably soothing and I’m in love with the feeling. I wish I could explain it better.

It’s been really hard these past couple of months. But when they say to find a hobby... I’m finding that it is really unbelievably helpful. I feel confident in myself knowing that I taught myself to do something that, to me, is so beautiful. On top of that, it’s also just something to do to entertain my mind so that the boredom of depression doesn’t eat me alive.",t2_5qdftt01,1,0
I'm in a weird place in my recovery,"I'm new to this site so a little tentative about it all.

I've been using another site/forum for quite a while but there were some limitations there so that's what brings me here. I'm very scared as I don't know anyone here! I am used to using an online forum but any tips from some of the regulars here would be welcome.

So I'll try to keep this short. I had a major breakdown a few years ago and a minor relapse a couple of years after that. I've been working hard at my recovery but I don't really know the next step to take.

Depression is definitely one of the things I struggle with but anxiety very much too. There's so much more I want to do but I'm feeling kind of stuck. Like sometimes I can't seem to move out of the mindset of being 'ill' into a better mindset where I even forget that I'm ill (does that even exist?).

I guess my biggest issue right now is finding a balance between online support and real-life support.

Anyway, I've written far more than I wanted to so I guess that's it for now. Thanks for reading.",t2_3zxrgvzi,2,0
[Serious] I'm lost -- does anyone have some advice?,"I've been subscribed to this community for ages now on my main account, but I'm never brave enough to post. But I need some advice, so I'm using a throwaway...

I'm 18, almost 19, and I've been depressed (with other mental illnesses as well) on and off since I was 10 when my life sort of started crumbling and it's never stopped. It fluctuates; I've had better months and terrible months. Life hasn't been too kind to me and I've lost a lot. I've lost family members, I lost every friend I'd had since I was little, I lost beloved pets...I've even lost any sense of self-worth or self-confidence that's turned into a pretty nasty case of self-loathing.

Over the years I've been suicidal and not suicidal. My first thought of suicide was when I was 10 when I seriously considered drowning myself in the pool of our school gym. My coping mechanisms range from outright disassociation and non-stop daydreaming to self-harm. 

The last six months have been pretty good ones with the odd low period here and there. I have a lot of emotional baggage and trust issues from multiple things from abuse to severe bullying that never seems to go away, but they haven't been as bad. Six months ago I also got my first girlfriend (I'm a lesbian) which I don't think was a coincidence. Even though the relationship was mostly long-distance, we both supported each other through good times and bad times. She made me laugh, she made me smile, I even stopped having to go to my therapist every single week because I was starting to be happy again. She was my support network and my best friend --- and I don't have any other friends. I live my life in complete solitude; no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to make friends. 

Because of my family's homophobia, the relationship was kept a secret. I told my therapist and one other person, but that was it. 

Friday night I was talking to her on the phone as usual and seemingly out of nowhere, she broke up with me. I think she was hoping the feeling would be mutual, we'd had a few communication problems over the last month or so, but I just thought that all relationships have their struggles. 

She said it was for my benefit, it was better that way. I told her that I'm 19 years old and I can make my own decisions; if I thought I needed something else I wouldn't still be trying to make things work. 

When she realized that that approach wasn't going to work, I guess she told me the plain truth: she can't handle my issues. 

She can't be there for me like I deserve, she says.   
She can't keep supporting me with all my ""problems."" The depression, the panics, the flashbacks, the baggage.  
It's not my fault, she says, she's being selfish and doing what's best for her. 

I love this girl more than anything, so I didn't argue. I will put her before myself, and if this isn't what she wants then I don't want her to stay. 

""You have every right to be angry,"" she said.   
""I'm not mad,"" I explained through tears, ""I'm f\*\*\*\*\*g devastated."" 

I cried that night.  
I cried the entirety of Saturday.  
I went to orchestra rehearsal on Sunday and ended up crying in front of people when someone asked if I was okay, and in one of my lectures yesterday, I started crying in front of my concerned professor. 

It's pretty safe to say that I'm basically shattered. In one night I lost everything, again.

I understand. I'm not angry with her at all; I get it. Loving someone who's as screwed up as I am is hard. 

But she made big promises to me that I believed, even though I knew better. I'm in shock, I'm devastated, I never saw it coming. I feel broken. 

And I'm angry. Livid. Absolutely furious...not at her, but at me. 

Here's the thing, I'm basically worthless, and I'm well aware of this fact. In life, I'm about as useful as a snowshoe is to a deep-sea worm. It was amazing to me that she would love me in the first place...and, well, I guess we're back to the point that gets proven every single time; it's not really possible to like me for very long. I learned a while ago that everyone gets sick of me eventually and runs for the hills. I just wanted to prove myself wrong. 

I guess the point to all of this is, I'm all alone and any self-worth I'd gained went straight down the drain. I'm angry at myself for being sick, even though I know it isn't logical; I look in the mirror and I'm filled with this...burning rage that I never feel toward anything else. I want to reach through the glass and grab the person staring back; I hate her, I loathe her, I want to hurt her, I want to make her suffer. When I look in the mirror I think horrible things that I've never thought toward anyone else. 

These last few days I've been rapidly deteriorating, and if suicide was an option I would happily take it. I dream of just closing my eyes and drifting off into nothing almost constantly. I couldn't tell you what any of my professors said in lectures yesterday because I just let the daydreaming take over and take me off somewhere where I wasn't hurting so badly. 

I barely remember anything that I did at work today except clocking in, and then feeling as though I kind of wandered around in a cloud of fog for a little while and suddenly someone was there to relieve me at the registers. Six hours passed and I don't remember them. I exist and yet I don't. It's like I detached myself from my own body so I don't feel what she feels anymore --- sometimes it feels like my mind and my physical body are two different people which is why I often refer to my body as ""she.""

I need some help. I need to figure out what to do; three days of disassociating and it's already affecting my schoolwork. I promised her that I wouldn't cut myself, but it's so hard not to pick up the blade and take the pain away. 

I'm lost, but some logical little voice keeps telling me that I can't go on like this. I'm afraid of what I might do to myself, not for my own sake but for the sake of my family; if I killed myself, it would destroy my parents. I feel like I want to strip away everything that makes me...me...since I'm not somebody who people want to be around. I'm just hoping that someone has some way for me to get through this without picking up a razor blade or just losing my grip on reality completely.

Let's make light of my crippling depression for a moment,"**Stupid thing to say No. 1:**""Just think about how lucky you are!"" ...Sweet Jesus. You've cured me....

Okay, I'm not going to start by saying I'm not actually lucky. I have a good life with a loving husband and a daughter in an area I like and blah blah blah. I guess I should acknowledge that I'm capable of ""seeing the bright side."" But that brain of mine doesn't give a flying fart in space about that when it gets rough. Instead it goes something like this:

""You're right our daughter is so cute and smart... Dear god I'm going to screw her up somehow. What if she turns into a crackhead?  God, I'm so selfish for having a child when my brain works like this. What if she goes through this? I love her so much I want to cry. I just want to hug her and play with her all day. But actually please be tired and go to bed because I'm having a mental breakdown. I'd love to get up and play with her but me needy the couchy and a nice warm blanket. And the shades drawn. And movies. And lots of cake. Do we have beef jerky? I'm going to eat all the cheese. Then I'll be happy.. for like ten seconds until I feel bad about everything I just ate and go into a food coma simultaneously. I think I'll start a cleanse and eat healthy. (goes to the store) Better buy oreos just in case! (Eats oreos and a pint of ben and jerry's) Dear god I'll always be this fat....""

You get the picture. Yes, I'm very ""lucky"" to think like this.... all day...everyday. I'm so thankful for my ability to turn positive things into miserable piles of garbage. No. It's not always this humorous.

So as I'm breaking myself down, people think its a good idea to remind me that I'm crappy at appreciating my life. I get why non-depressed people think that might be a good idea, but it is so, so misguided. Does anyone just go, ""Wow, I see that you are questioning your self-worth and disgustingly anxious. Let me just say you are really good at (insert something positive here). The world is a better place because you routinely do that thing.""?

No. No, they don't. They just assume that in the overwhelming chaos that is my brain I'm capable of forming a rational positive thought about my value on planet earth with that broad nonsense.

So what's depression like? Let's put it in perspective. It's like playing a game of freeze tag with yourself except nobody likes playing and its awful. 

**Actual depression freeze tag reviews:**

""I just couldn't stop playing!""- *Girl stuck in the well during the Silence of the Lambs film*.

Who the hell knows? I'm still worrying about it while I've become one with my couch. If you figure it out, feel free to reach out. I'll be here with my Ben and Jerry's in pajamas I haven't changed out of in two days not engaging in any part of society and ordering take out online because calling in an order or making food is too stressful and exhausting. ",t2_x5jhr,1,0

Making friends/being social is an impossible task,"Trying to make friends and be social is very hard for me. It's always been something I've struggled with. Systematically, I would either purposely ruin my friendships (behave oddly/irritatingly, refuse to hang out, not respond to messages/calls/texts, start finding reasons to not be friends, ect) or ghost people to the point of being strangers. When these friendships would die off, I'd have a little bit of sadness, a bit of relief, a bit of anger, and then it would fizzle out to a hazy memory. I'd almost become apathetic and *maybe* reminisce or lament the past but that's about the extent of it. I just don't know why it's always been like this but it feels like I just can't tolerate the idea of having friends.

It's hard because I do think (?) I'm lonely. Like I long to have platonic companionship but I just can't seem to make the effort. I've tried Discord, Telegram, Facebook, and other communities irl but I can never bring myself to commit. Or worse, I start sabotaging myself even if everything is going well. Even if the other person puts in all the work, I will not make the effort and I can't convince myself to do more than a polite refusal or a vague excuse. It's even worse in that I just don't even feel connected to the people who call me their friend so it's not like I'm so unlikable people avoid me but I still feel like I'm faking them out every day.

Hope.,"
I live by not getting my hopes up.

All that is out the window today, today I’m getting my hopes up, and praying everything works itself out.


I have had people reach out to me, possibly saving my literal life. They don’t even know how bad I need the help.


For me I always had to do it solo, no handouts, I was the person who was the helper.


It runs in the family.


Here today, I survived my first night!
17 more days to go.


I have hope that these people will help me!
Nothing’s promised, so I need to be planning for backup plans as well.


But, for a guy like me that has no one to help me, for strangers on the internet, I can’t believe people care. 

Why does the world feel so crappy, why does real life human interactions not feel like this?


I was almost 100% sure everyone was a bot or faking human interactions but now, idk.

Oh man, I can’t wait to pay them back tho, like, man I when I get stable again, I going to pay it forward LIKE NEVER BEFORE!

Ugh, why are my hopes so high...

Like I can see myself in the car, breaking down if I get let down, but then I can’t even be mad at being let down, because you got your hopes up!

But idk idk idk, when you don’t have much else to do but wait on other people your kinda in a bad spot.

Waiting 24 hours for “temporary housing applications “ whyyyy!!!!!

And then had the nerve to say because I’m 100% through the va, I might make to much for assistance? Seriously? I’m homeless.

Man I swear, the older I get the more see that people just have to push buttons or write on paper and things can happen. 


Just wish I had ONE FRIEND who owned an apartment complex and was like, my dude, I know your a good guy, so here you go a place to stay, Pay me when ur check comes in.

Love how it’s always “my fault”,"My dad is having money problems? That’s my fault. Cause he has to buy me food and provide for my overall well-being as his child. The house is a mess? It’s my fault. Even though it’s obvious both my dad and I are depressed and don’t have the motivation to do anything. But everybody teams up, I.e. my brother and his wife, with my dad, and blames it all on me. Saying I could do more and need to stop hiding in my room all the time. I don’t have my license yet? My fault because my dad would rather drink and basically drift in and out of consciousness all day, and then blame me for not getting my driving time in when I don’t wanna drive in the middle of the night with him barely conscious in the passenger seat. Not to mention the only time he wants to go and do driving is, of course, to buy more alcohol! Like he did tonight. He literally hides a giant bottle of vodka from me and takes swigs of it at the same time as drinking a beer or moonshine. And I guarantee you most of that is being bought when I’m at work or out with others. So in a way, I’m not looking froward to getting my license because I’m just gonna be his chauffeur for a “beer run” like three times a week. Cause that’s all I’m good for. And even then I’m not good enough. 

I hide out in my room cause I’ve got nothing better to do and don’t wanna be around anyone? Everybody must need to talk trash about me as a result. Instead of, you know, asking what’s wrong, how about talking about me behind my back and then screaming at me about staying in my room all the time? That’s what my dad and brother do apparently. My dad revealed in the middle of one his bi polar episodes last weekend, that my brother said I don’t do enough around the house and would rather team up with my dad and make me out to be the villain. I already can’t stand him so he really didn’t do himself any favors by doing that. Just further confirmed to me that I can’t trust him or his wife. Which I already knew but whatever. 

I just adore the fact that EVERYTHING, is my fault. And if I get mad about it? Oh I’m in for hell! I’m not allowed to get mad about anything my “family” does. Cause they’re all perfect, and so is their reasoning. Me on the other hand? I’m just your typical whiny teenager so who cares what I think? I look forward to the day, whether it be via killing myself or some other miracle, I get away from these “people” for good. Cause I’m beyond sick of them and their bs at this point.

This is just a venting on my current situation - jobs and businesses,"I'm not well. I still have those days where my ocd scares the shit out of me,where I spend hours on end ruminating my thoughts. I still feel like I can't find a job just yet.

My first and last job was during all June last year - after that my ocd exploded to where I couldn't leave the house. I spent so many months scared to find therapy because I was scared to be misdiagnosed.

I'm better now... Much better! But I still have those peaks of anxiety (according to my therapist) it's not panic attacks... I can't breathe during those moments and I'm afraid to be tossed aside by my peers.

Finding a job here is very complicated... It's so hard and no one wants to hire someone with social anxiety (they can see that in my face). I'm actually great with customers. I'm nice and people are open to me and chat with me. The biggest problem here is  coworkers. They are mean and sarcastic. And this is in any job! I don't understand... I truly don't. I just want to do my job but they are never satisfied... 

I worked in a supermarket for a whole month. It wasn't great. If I may say so myself I was the best at dealing with customers. I was very nice. I am a nice person! I don't show that annoyed face that my co workers used to show. People liked me and asked me questions because I had a nice young face... This is not to brag, just something I noticed. (maybe that's why they put me as a cashier a lot). But I was weak and not fast enough... And my co workers were mean to each other. I hated going to work... I loved working as a cashier because I like to do the same tasks... I was OK at it and whenever there was a mild problem Id solve it myself (illegally &gt;&gt; let's say I gave a lot of free stuff to people) but I was bad at everything else... And I was constantly afraid of not being fast enough or good enough and having to talk with my coworkers was a nightmare for me... It was really stressful but I wanted to endure it as an experience and to work hard. But I couldn't handle it... Also my dad was a big problem... He was so controlling that he'd pick me up at work and sometimes yell to my managers (there's a lot of stories arounf this but I want to keep this post as short as possible) so I couldn't handle to stay there more than a month. 

My family is forcing me to open a business of my own with their money. I feel so bad for that because I don't want to spend *their* money and be in *their* debt. It's not my money. It's theirs. I don't want to feel guilty for not working for that money if it makes sense. I feel like I have to suffer to be happy. Plus, I want to leave my family and live alone... I won't live here forever... I don't want to live in this city forever! I want to save money and go away with my gf to somewhere nice and healthy.

I feel like if I use their money, they will control me or keep me here... Not only that, it's not right to use their money..

I'm a terrible person... I love my family but sometimes they annoy me... And I feel bad for thinking that about them. My therapist has been opening my eyes to my ""not-healthy"" family and I have been feeling more defensive to them lately. I just hate my personality. I'm trying to change but for some reason I always come back to what I was.

I'm so afraid to not be good enough to my gf... She deserves so much better...

Edit: maybe I'm being lazy... I am lazy... I like to work but I'm so scared to not be good enough... I don't know",t2_55izlmzv,3,0
I feel like I want to kill myself again for the first time in a few years,"I've been having a hard time recently and randomly typed watched a video about suicide. It made me tear up and acknowledge how much I've been thinking of killing myself recently.

My last suicidal thoughts were a few years ago, and they were the worst since they came with a plan. I never felt so low and once out of it I never thought I'd feel this way again.

It's fucking stupid, my family are amazing and my friends are amazing. I love them stupid amounts. But I've suffered from depression for years. And it's held me back. My job at the moment, my colleagues are cool, the pay is fairly good, but it gives me so much anxiety. I feel at breaking point. 

For someone who has social anxiety, to be speaking to customers all day does me no good. And the system that tracks everything is flawed, my bosses targets are stupidly high. And his assistant, personally I get on with her and like her, but she has taken an interest in my figures and wants to bring up an inconsistency with what she reports and what I report. I've told you so many times that the system makes duplicates and the figures I've been trained to follow doesn't follow my call outs, but no one fucking listens and I feel like I'm constantly scrutinized and don't receive any praise. 

Yeah, if you have social anxiety why would you apply for jobs that involve speaking to customers? I couldn't complete university because of my mental health issues and it turns out majority of basic jobs that you don't need a degree for involve customer interaction mainly.

The thought of going back to work tomorrow is putting me on the verge of a panic attack or a breakdown. I've been thinking about killing myself. I've been at my job for a year now but if I feel like I couldn't be honest about my struggles because I'd be either told to get on with it or just take unpaid leave.

feels like i am stuck with the depression. i am not happy. should i just end it?,"so before i start with the problem i wanted to point out some background and situations that made me where i am currently at.

i'm a 26 y/o aspiring art person that wants to get into the film and games industry but due to current paperwork processing of getting my work permit i cannot apply to those jobs. 

i'm currently stuck working at a small real estate as an Admin member of the company for about 2 years now and i hated every single moment of it (although there are some small enjoyable moments).  When i started working at this company i was the only one that handles the majority of small to big odd jobs (examples: order supplies &amp; services, I.T works, Printer and Scanner work, customer services etc.)  work from a 9-6 schedule had made me stressed, tired and lost interest of making art or even having a proper eating habit/exercise schedule. 

eventually i got a notice that i need to get back to school to keep up to date with my paperwork. But the company wants me to stay with them and so i did. Working at a high stress work place during the morning while also studying at night had given me less than no time to relax. i started to hated myself of unable to do what i was intended to do with my degree. i get depressed and sad whenever the boss lashed out if things does not go out his/her way. i started to develop an immature habit in the workplace where my attitude of feeling unhappy would show throughout the day. i have discuss this with my parents about this but i do not think they understand of the current situation. I feel like if i were to keep pushing the more i am just one day going to break and just end it all. should i start talking about this to a therapist? or should i just keep on crying it all out and think that tomorrow will eventually never come.

TLDR: im depressed with where i currently am with my workplace and school to where i cannot enjoy doing art stuff or being like myself. should i start seeking help??",t2_12jcsl3w,1,0
How do I strip myself of the mask I wear?,"I am in therapy, I am working on this with them.  


My therapist just hearkened back to a personality trait that friends and significant others past and present have brought to my attention within the last 6 years: I am a good actor. I am an empath, I care so deeply for other people and their problems/joys, but when I am asked to open up in return I choose to hide my emotions away. I want to cry. I want to cry very often, and that's not socially acceptable, so I boxed it up a long time ago. Now I don't feel anything except the occasional overdose of fear or apathy.  


I notice that these emotions are linked- this happens frequently. I get numb in that I notice I am not experiencing emotion at all, and sometimes that numbness is so intense that I mistake it for embarrassment. My body heats up, my cheeks flush, I shake; it's almost like a panic, but I cannot think of anything in that moment, and I don't feel anything except fear.  


I was raped by my now-ex for 2 1/2 years, I lost myself somewhere in there, and I wore a mask to protect myself from my family when we were together. I wore it to protect myself from him, so that his rejection of things I wanted to do didn't hurt so much. I wore it because I lost my job trying to help a suicidal student when I was in college. I wore it to make that hurt and shame go away; the mask made it seem like I was confident to my superiors, they stopped second-guessing me when I wasn't a nervous wreck in front of them. My ex stopped being such an asshole when I complied; I saved face for so long.  


It goes back even further. I used to cry in elementary school for no reason. Someone would look at me and start to say hello, I would start crying. Someone brushed my shoulder? Crying. Walking down the hallway? Crying. I never understood why that would happen, but my classmates eventually brought it up to me in a derogatory way when I was in like...3rd or 4th grade. I had a crush on a boy and he rejected me because I was too sensitive. He didn't want to be with someone who cried so much.  


I wore it when I was bullied by a group of pretty girls in school, I was always bigger than they were, I felt like I wasn't as pretty. I compared myself to them often, and put up that mask to ward off their taunting; it made it stop hurting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wore it when my best friend group went behind my back and started a rumor that I was gay, and that I had touched my friend. I hadn't hung out with them in months, but when I went to school the day after they lit that flame, I was tormented. No one wanted to associate with me. I grew closer to my teachers instead, and that got me through the last of those months until graduation, but it was still hell. People shoved pieces of paper into my desk that said, ""Die dyke,"" on them. I was tripped and spat on at recess. I had a slushee thrown at me on picture day. I had food and a tray thrown at me, and the kid's mom only caught me throwing said food and tray back at her kid, so she made me pick everyone's trash up at that table, and then had the audacity to grab me by my arm and drag me outside of the lunch room to scold me. For something that her child deserved. The girl scout troop my mom had worked so hard to build disbanded because the moms hated me; they didn't want their daughters associating with a family like mine.  


When no one volunteered to sit with me upstairs because I broke my leg, I broke. And I placed my mask. I deadened my emotions so I wouldn't cry, so I wouldn't be hurt by the rejection I felt.  


I don't want to devalue these experiences, as much as part of me belittles them and thinks them trivial. I belittle them because I think you will, too. I'm anticipating your reactions so it doesn't hurt.  


I don't know if this is a rant or an inquiry for help. Whatever feedback you want to give me is fine. Thanks for listening.",t2_143x0g,10,0
"I lost my GF and everything in between, hope, suicide is not an option","Hi,

Long story short, I'm experiencing depression and major anxiety(social, physical) since 2017. The silent killer started right when I finished highschool, until then I thought that the national test, final highschool exam, before going to college is the purpose that we have since we are little, at least this was my experience, my parents and my teachers always told me: be careful, you re going to have your national final exam soon!

After I aced that test, I had no idea what I wanted to do but since half of my closest friends  were going to the country's capital to study there, I started going to law school since September, 2017. I was renting an apartment with one of my friends. In that same month, I met a girl from my local city who was also going to study in the capital. We talked for 2-3 weeks and then we met, had a couple of dates, I instantly fell in love with her, she was literally my dream girl, the only thing that I was a bit skeptical about was the fact that she was clinical depressed because her father died a few years ago. When it comes to girls, dates and all the things in between, I feel confident and playful. But I could not even lean in for a kiss or a hug with this girl on any of our dates, it was all about talking, we would talk for 6 hours straight without getting bored. I was feeling that she is very cold, I assumed she has trust issues or anxiety since every girl that I talked to or went out with tried to at least hug me, or slap me. But this girl had no reaction whatsoever whenever we would have met or when she had to go home, she would always be like ok i have to go, bye, not even in a rude way I could tell she is really shy and anxious. Eventually with the risk of being very needy I confessed my feelings to her, told her how much I like her etc. she refused me by explaining to me that at that time she would not have felt comfortable having a relationship with me because she didn t want to hurt me. I called that a bullshit, kept stalking her for a few months, meanwhile I dropped out of college because I had missed so many classes due to what I used to call at that time: laziness.

So I went back home, in my local city, over the next months I noticed that I am no longer able to breathe normally. Basically I did not know but I had every physical symptom of anxiety. My parents were dissapointed that I dropped out of college, they paid for my rent and food in the capital so I felt really bad for that. They are living in another country so I stayed with my grandma in my local city. So winter-spring 2018, I used to play video-games, did not take showers, would meet up with friends once a week maybe, could not breathe, got angry because of that so the result was that I could not breathe at all. Same thing, different days, I was a mess. In this period of time, I used to stalk that girl, I was ashamed of myself, how can I be so needy, buthurt etc. She would text me once in a while to ask me what's up, at the beggining I was trying not to care and to show her that I do not care anymore but I would have ended up being even more needy...anyway nothing happened she would ghost me, I would get upset and the conversation was gone.

July, 2018. I applied for a marketing degree, again in the capital, rented up an apartement with that same friend and another one who was also going to the same classes as I would go to. This time I attended classes, I had decent grades, this girl would still conctact me from time to time, same old story: cocky-needy-ghosting, met some girls, they would literally invite me to have sex with them every day, I never did go tho. All of my friends were making fun of me for refusing to go, but I could simply not explain to them that I do not feel confortable to do that because I have no emotional attaction to these girls even if they are hot. Long story short first year at that college was ok..I still had only 2 friends in the city, the ones in my apartment.

April 2019: This is the beggining of the end. I was in my local city for the spring break. That same girl that I could not forget texted me and wanted to meet up that night. I said ok, we saw each other, talked for hours, then she said she has to go, I took her to her place then I went home. She wanted to go out again the next day, and after that the next day and so on until she told me that she regrets not trying to get into a relationship with me since the beggining. Long story short we got together, I swear on my life that I would never forget April, June and July of 2019 because these months were the happiest months I have ever lived. I could share tear of joy. We would sleep at my place 5-6 days out of 7 right from week 2. The sex was amazing, the connection, the intimacy of just sleeping next to each other. We literally did everything together in those 3 moths, I felt like I finally get to be happy, I genuinely thought that she is my soulmate and that I want to marry her. Then things started to turn around in a bad way. Sooner or later we had to go back to the capital because the summer break was almost over. Since I spent all summer with her and some of my friends, I neglected the other friends who were my roomates. One of them decided to move in with another guy and the other one with his gf. This girl proposed to me to rent an aroatment together, I was a bit skeptical about this but I decided to go for it. The closer the autumn was getting, the less sex we had, and actually the more depressed she would be. 

September-December 2020 No sex, fighting almost everyday, she got more depressed because she had to go to work and at college at the same time. Her friends are rich, she would always get angry for not being as rich or as cool as her friends. I always told her that she is the most beautiful, smartest of them all but she did not care anymore about my opinion. I started to miss classes because I reopened the laziness mood for literally no reason, it just happened because we would fight 5 days out of 7. I was angry due to the lack of sexual life, she was angry that she has to go to work, college and to have a social life at the same time. She is obsessed with having social life, the perfect instagram, the perfect circle of friends, boyfriend with designer clothes, etc. She was always like this except those 3 months when she was genuienly happy. Eventually I dropped out of college because going to those classes would make me sick, she would also make me angry, the only thing that I enjoyed were the video games. Started playing a lot, she got upset, enetually broke up with me because of my lack of motivation, started talking with another dudes because I checker her social media account. The point until here is that this time I was the purposeless, depressed one who needed help, for 6 months everytime she would get just a bit depressed or having panic attacks, fights with her mother I would have came in seconds to protect and support her, I fell one time off the wagon and she literally dumped me herself. I had no friends, only her, could not tell my parents that I dropped out of college again so I got a job, she wanted to get back together, I agreed, still no sex, she would still be depressed because she has no materialistical things that she can enjoy in her life, over the last 2 months of 2020 she started going to clubs with her friends, she always asked me to go with her but she did not seem very interested to convince me to join them, eventually found out that she talked to another guy, and got excited because a popular rich guy who also likes clubbing wanted to date her, confronted her about it, she lied to my face, broke up with her, the next day I asked her if she also thinks that this was the right decision and she said yes. She would hug or kiss  me once a day now, she still looks very unhappy, at the moment we still live in the same place, we are stuck like this for 1 month or 2. I know it's a lot, its the first time i am posting, i did not mention everything because so much had happened. the point is that i  have no purpose now, i am literally heartbroken i can feel pain in my heart every night that i would think about the fact that this is over and she alresdy moved on. i am sick of crying every day, I legit wanted to kill myself the other night but i can never do this to my parents who love me so much, I love them but i can not live one more week on this earth. i am so sad, tired of this life. i feel like this girl literally destoyed me. idk what to do. if u cant give me advice its ok, i just wanted to share my story because i have no friends who i can talk with.

I need to vent or I'm gonna do something I cant take back. I cant keep doing this. Put me out of my misery.,"Last night I couldn't sleep so I decided to finally write my note.

Deep pain from reading horror stories,"I used to consume horror stories all the time. They transfixed me perfectly, always delivering fascinating chills. There's a certain stunning beauty in the slow decay and destruction of things, and the terrors of the unknown as well. For me, horror became compulsive, as I would sometimes get an itch for a little mystery and terror. I believe my depression was developing more at the time, and it's already known that horror has an effect on people.

Whatever the case, I fell in love with *Marble Hornets*. Perhaps it's kind of trashy, but I  spent entire weeks devouring the series. It enticed me and terrified me. Soon enough though, something happened. Sometimes it was too much and I had to stop. And then all I could do was lay on the floor in terror. Within me rose a feeling, or sensation of a sort. For hours at a time I'd be laying on the floor, motionless, and terrified of things that I don't understand. Even now I don't know if I can explain it. It was cold, unspeakable, crushed my soul and wouldn't let me go.

I'll try to express a bit of how it felt in text.

Imagine a long-abandoned, filthy room with yellowed walls and grime in every corner. To the left lies an old metal bed frame, jagged and rusted, with no bedding. Behind there is a doorway. You thought you saw a dark hallway, but you can't bring yourself to look. There's a window, but it's much too dark to see anything. And then you see it - the lead pipe on the floor. You touch it, you stare at it. You can't move. You're terrified of it and you don't know why.

I think that expresses it pretty well. I'm sorry if it's campy. I'm bringing back painful things to make this.

I don't know how my internet horror habits did this much to me. This is the closest I've ever gotten to my mind just snapping. In a classical sense, I was going insane. The insanity was miserable and terrifying, but intoxicating.

I promised myself to avoid anything horror. This wasn't so difficult. In fact, I'm not sure I could've made myself find those things if I tried. Still though, I was fascinated and perplexed about why this happened. In time, I never got an answer but I learned that all you can really do is leave it behind. Dwelling on it only breeds itself.

It took time. But I generally continued to become a lot better, and completely forgot about the whole thing. Of course I've never stopped being fascinated by horror. Some things happen, but nothing the same as before. I try to keep boundaries. Just one good scare will linger with me for hours, so I scarcely go on a binge.

My recent interest in horror brought this back, and I'm realizing an important piece of the history of my depression that I overlooked because of other big things. I'm not sure if horror's good for me or anyone who has depression, but it's a unique and interesting genre. It's probably based on the depressed person in question.

Thank you for reading. If you have any opinions or advice on safely doing horror stuff as a depressed person then I'd like to hear it. I hope you all do well.",t2_7vg6a0,2,0

Already put myself a date to leave this damn world,"I'm tired of struggling in life. 19 years old and life won to me. Congratulations, you won. I'm tired of fighting anymore. Moreover, I'm tired of losing everything, friends, interests...
I can't bear anymore the comments upon myself, about if I did right or wrong, can't take it anymore. I hate what I'm studying, I have no objectives, I have nothing to do, no one to care. 

But above all I'm tired of me, of myself, I'm done with my bad actions, with my potential mental instability, about everything I've done so far, it's worthless.

So coward, so useless, so bad... I deserve a bullet in my head and that is what I decided. This year on August will be the end of my path.",t2_3450ucyf,3,0
Regarding the selfish aspect of depression,"I don't feel like the selfishness of depression gets talked about enough. It's not direct or intentional selfishness, but rather a by-product. I mean, you spend almost all day consumed with battling your own thoughts and feelings, often to the point where you become completely disconnected from the rest of the world, totally self-involved, but in the worst way. It causes you to forget things like birthdays, that concert that your friend really wanted you to go to, spacing out and counting all the reason your boss thinks you're a loser while Jan from accounting is gushing about her upcoming ski trip. 

And if you live with it long enough, maybe you watch it cripple your social skills and intellect because you're so consumed with existential dread, guilt and despair that you don't have enough mental capacity to pay attention to social cues or spend time being interested in learning about something other than why you're a failure.

Idk, it's a unique kind of selfishness.",t2_1i9ot40q,2,0

Why do I feel like everyone’s fake and I’m the only one left who’s real,Every day I feel more and more isolated surrounded by social media constantly. Consuming content recklessly and eating junk food. I live in the moment and try to think of my future but constantly find myself living in the past. I have no real friends. Most people I grew up with deleted me from socials except for a handful because of my trashy posts and memes while they post pics of their family. I look at everyone’s profiles and think why are they so happy and are they really that happy. Am I happier for living a lonely life with no kids and just me and my gf. Should I go out more and do more things than just sit at home on the Internet binging content and porn? I watch porn constantly and it’s the only thing that makes me feel lust anymore. I think why can’t I have experiences like that why is everyone having so much more fun than me and here I just am... existing.... sitting here. What’s wrong with me???,t2_hwwo3,1,0

Not making the cut,"Hey guys. New here. Just thought i'd say hello. I'm 37. Have a good life, happy and healthy kids, a job. No reason to complain. Yet I always feel like an outsider. That people don't like me. That they put up with me just because it's polite, not because they want to. Even people I feel very close to I always feel like more of a burden to them. Also I always feel insignificant, not special. That if I achieve anything it's because it was easy, anyone could. When other people achieve things I think how amazing it is and how I could never be that. Imposter syndrome I think they call it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, just feel like i've faked my way in life. That i'm not worth much of anything, despite what outward appearances may seem. I know i'm not the only one but it's lonely regardless.

I wish there was an antidepressant like a painkiller.,"Like, something you can take for on-the-spot depression, you know? I've gotten to the point in my recovery where I've found a cocktail of meds that works for me, I'm generally pretty okay, and I don't feel like a danger to myself most of the time. But then there are moments like tonight.

I just can't shut up that inner voice telling me I'm an eternal fuck-up. The self-loathing is intense tonight. I know it's just because of some recent minor mistakes here and there, most of which objectively weren't my fault and with no harm done, but try telling my brain that. Maybe it's so bad because I'm upset I had to cancel a trip to visit my brother? Also could be hormones? I don't know anymore.

Anyway, I just wish there was an antidepressant I could take for moments like this. It's not like I can just take more of my meds when I feel worse, that's not how it works and it's a good way to end up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped or something. I don't know if/how something like that would work, but I just... I don't know. I'm falling into old thought patterns. ""Eternal fuck up."" ""I just want to get out."" Et cetera.

I need to get back into therapy. Time to stop procrastinating, calling my list of potential therapists in the morning. Just wanted to vent a little, I guess. Going to distract myself tonight. I know what I need to do, but these familiar thought patterns are so hard to get out of. Maybe because they're familiar? It's almost comfortable, in a way. The way a chair is comfortable and you don't want to get up, even though you're losing circulation to your legs, your butt's gone numb, and you can't find a decent way to position your arms anymore. It's just easier not to get up. But you have to anyway.",t2_5dognkj6,30,0

I just want to fucking end my life so bad that if I had easy access to a lethal dose of medicine I would take the entire bottle.

How to find out if I really have depression?,"Hi,

I am a 29 year old male. Since I was a kid i have always been obese. I had a really shitty childhood and I started to overeat as a coping mechanism. Until today I am struggling with that. I managed a few times to loose a lot of weight by eating healthier and moving more, but I never manage to keep that lifestyle. I always slip back in my old habits at some point.

In addition I have a real problem to motivate myself. I gradually lost all interest in my hobbies. It feels like nothing gives me pleasure anymore. On days i don't have to work i often don't do anything anymore.

I am also feeling completely alone. I don't have many friends because I moved a lot in the last 7 years. And the few friends I have i hardly ever see because I dont want to ruin their day by beeing a boring downer.
I also have been single for 6 years now and I still lack the confidence to date again. My former girlfriend left me for another guy she allready was dating before we broke up and it crushed me. Somehow  I can't get over it.

The only thing I have going for me is that I recently got promoted to be the leader of a team of 40 people. Some former coworkers talked me into applying for that position. But I feel like a failure and a fraud now that i have the job. Strangely i always get neutral or good feedback, despite not beeing statysfied with my own work.

For a long time I have been wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I feel stuck.

I feel like a failure because I am obese.
I am obese because i lack motivation.
I lack motivation because I see no positive future for me.
which in turn makes me overeat because that is how i learned to cope.

That is why i want to get help. But i don't know where to start. I don't have a doctor i trust. If I go to a random doctor they will tell me I need to loose weight. Which is true, but I need to get my mental health fixed for that to happen.

I know I sound like a f'in defeatist but I am really desperate

So after this long wall of text:
Does this sound like a depression to you?
Have any of you been in the same situation?
How can I start to get out of this cycle?

I want to help my spouse but have NO idea where to begin...,"Hi, I am brand new to this board and I’m hoping to get some genuine, helpful feedback. If this is not allowed, I sincerely apologize. Also, sorry about the length of this message.
My (f46) husband (m44) has been medically diagnosed with depression for 2 years now. I suspect he was depressed prior to that, but he self medicated with booze, heavily drank and now has cirrhosis. 2 years ago, he wound up in the hospital (that’s where we found out the cirrhosis) and without the alcohol, he felt the weight of everything. He was put on depression meds, a small dose initially. They bumped the dosage up after 6 or so months when he said he didn’t feel any different (I noticed a difference, especially when he would skip his medicine, but to be fair, it isn’t about what I notice and more about how he feels).
Fast forward a year - he picks up drinking again. He binges regularly because he can’t handle the depressed feeling. He has refused all counseling and says it doesn’t work for him. He was forced to go as a child and has hated the idea of psychiatry ever since. He went a few times for alcohol dependency and recovery, but he didn’t go regularly and just sort of quit at some point.
This past November, due to cutbacks, he was downsized and lost his job of 20 years. This had nothing to do with the drinking, but it caused him to binge harder and to become more and more depressed.
For 4 months he has been actively looking for a job and actively either been rejected or the salary didn’t match around what he was making before. He has slowly but steadily sunk deeper and deeper into a depressive state. A month ago and he doctor changed his prescriptions to a mixture of depression meds, but he hates how the new one makes him feel. He was binging off and on and doesn’t always take his medicine regularly, which of course does zero to help him fight his depression.
I never hear him laugh anymore. He sleeps all day. He barely wakes up to use the bathroom. Over the course of the past 4 days, he only got out of bed to go get vodka (Saturday), and to take the kids to school one morning (Monday). Other than that, he has slept the entire time. As much as 23 hours a day. He won’t get out of bed. He doesn’t text me anymore; won’t even talk to me really. Very minimal effort if any at all. He feels useless and I can see the depression taking hold of him more and more.
So how can I best help him? What did you find helpful or comforting when you were sinking and just wanted to end it all? I just started keeping his pills in a pillbox so on the days that I notice they haven’t been taken, I wake him and beg him to take them until I see him swallow them down. I hate doing this, but I hate seeing him suffer more. Any advice? I’ve never suffered from depression or anxiety and I’m not sure best how I can help him, or if I should even bother. I don’t want to cause him to sink further, this is so hard.

He was trying so hard to make me laugh and smile and I was having such a hard time getting out of this funk. I eventually calmed myself down and we finally laughed and had good rest of the afternoon. 

I just can't get rid of this overwhelming feeling that I don't deserve him. I usually don't feel like this so I don't know why I do today. He just tried so much to make me feel better and it just made me realize how amazing of a guy I have. I'm just feeling overwhelmed by how caring he is to me and how much I feel like I don't deserve him.

Having trouble adjusting to a normal sleep schedule,"
Ever since I was 13 my sleep schedule has been upside down. It messed with my alertness in school. I’d go to sleep at 3 am on average, and I’d have to wake up by 7 am to get to school. I’d often sleep through my classes which resulted in me eventually dropping out of middle school. I did end up going back and finishing it the next year though. 

I’m 19 now, I still struggle from this backwards schedule. I sleep at 6am-2pm. That’s the schedule that seems to do it for me. I wake up fully rested and I feel awake and alert. I’ve tried resetting the schedule several times. In fact I did it yesterday. I slept at 9pm and woke up at 6am. Fairly normal right? When I woke up my entire body felt like rusty tin. All my joints hurt and my eyes felt sandy. I still feel weak and it’s only 11am. I tried walking outside and getting sun, I tried eating, I tried showering but I just feel so unbelievably lethargic and bad. I feel like I need slept at all. Everything hurts.

I’m not sure what to do about this. I know what my body likes I know that sleeping the way I usually do seems to work for me but it’s really problematic. I lost my first job because I woke up too late, I also had to drop out of high school and half the night that I am up there’s nothing g left to do and I’m all alone. I experience depression and anxiety as well if that matters.",t2_5hsqzc0c,3,0

Venlafaxine and Blood Pressure?,"So, I was sick a few weeks ago and made a trip to the doctor. When they took my blood pressure, the doctor remarked it was a bit high. This concerned me, so I've been monitoring it at home since then. It is pretty consistently 137/97.


 Now, my diet and exercise routine are far from great. However, this still seems pretty high for my current lifestyle. I know some antidepressants can increase blood pressure. I currently take venlafaxine (150 mg). Has anyone experienced an increase I'm blood pressure on this medication? 


Part of me is just looking for some excuses so I can stop worrying about this as much as I am, but I am also just genuinely curious.

I do have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and my primary care doctor next week, so I am not seeking any medical advice. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.

Improvement,"I’ve suffered from depression from early highschool that was triggered by social anxiety, loneliness, and other factors that involve my family and environmental stress. I had a downward spiral in late college due to a breakup and attempted/contemplated suicide. I failed multiple times to kill myself by plugging my exhaust pipe of my car (the cloth kept coming off even with duct tape) and attempted hanging myself in my dorm but was scared of what the afterlife may bring, even though I’m agnostic. After class, I made a post on FaceBook about how everything seemed meaningless and stopped contact with family that became concerned. They got worried and my half sister that was in my college town ended up finding me, and at that point my mental stability began to crash and I didn’t even know who I was anymore. She kept talking about how if I keep it up I’ll have to be put in a hospital and be monitored and put on medications, which only made me lose my mind even more. It took awhile to recover, and living with my agressive and verbally abusive brother didnt help with that. He said in one of our biggest fights that I should’ve killed myself. After time went on, I began to regain a positive self image, coped with being alone, and began to realize that I have people around me that love and care about me. I made so many close friends at work, have a better relationship with my brother, and found out a good friend of mine from college likes me. I’m now starting vet school this fall and have a more positive outlook on life and my future.

"A glimpse into my existence, notice I don’t say life.. because I’m not living.","I’m a (25F) who has been battling depression for as long as I can remember. Only did I get professional help within the past year. I see a therapist twice a week and a psychiatrist once a month. For a whole year now. I can honestly say I’m only getting worse. Especially within the past 3 years. I’ve tried all the grounding techniques and breathing exercises, and 7 types of medications. Nothing is working and I’m only putting more and more financial strain on my dad. He supports me financially when it comes to medical bills, and oh do I feel so guilty about that. He is the only parent who works due to my mom having a heart condition. As you guessed i still live under their roof because I can’t hold a job long enough to support myself. I was clinically diagnosed with depression and GAD, and I’m sure that’s just the tip of it. I don’t understand my emotions and due to the depression causing memory loss and brain fog that doesn’t allow me to comprehend or configure sentences to express my issues to my doctors. I have nothing to my name. No car, no job, no nothing. I have a loving boyfriend of 6 years who has supported me as much as he can throughout all of this. A lot of the times he doesn’t know what to do or say, and I remind him I don’t blame him. Nothing in this world could make me feel any differently. Everyday I wake up I sigh, here we go again. I sleep majority of the days away. I’m talking 15-
18 hours I’m asleep. I can only stay awake for up to 3 hours max before dozing off needing a nap. My mind runs constantly about this and that and all of the above to the point I exhaust myself. There is nothing more I want at this point than to not be alive. I just don’t want to do it anymore. I pray for death. I pray every-time I leave my house I die in a car accident, a stray bullet, a fire, anything. I get jealous when I hear on the news someone has passed. I wish it were me. Now there is this new coronavirus spreading and everyone is freaking out, sweeping stores of canned goods, water and necessities. While I pray I come in contact with someone who is infected. I have a very loving family. Two loving parents, an older sister (who pushed me to address my mental health) and a younger brother who has a big heart. I could never commit suicide, because we’re all that we have. No other family ties. We all live together, and always have so were very very close. I think about it every day though. Hanging myself from the tree out back. Taking every single pill I have and can find through out the house. Feeding a tube from the exhaust pipe of the car through my window into my closet with me in it. Driving into oncoming traffic. Hell, I even saw in a movie a guy wrapped a rope around his neck, through his back window of the car and around a tree and hit the gas. I’ve thought about blowing my brains out. But all of this is gruesome and would mentally fuck anyone who heard their loved one passed in such a way. I can’t do that to them. But how is that fair to me, that I live such a miserable life just for the sake of those around me? I juggle those two.. do I finally do something that I want, or keep pleasing those around me? My parents know I have depression and anxiety but who really knows what that means unless you are going through it. I know they don’t understand and are uncomfortable with the thought of it so it’s just an “here is the money for your thing” type thing. I never really have gone into detail about any of this because I don’t want them to think they failed me. I had a very good childhood. No incidences. I was a very anxious kid but because of that it pushed me to do what I was told and get good grades. I always wonder why I have depression and anxiety. I was never molested, abused, or bullied more than the average kid. I haven’t gone through anything traumatic, or anything more than the average heartbreak from a high-school sweetheart. I do have to admit, he did abused me, emotionally, mentally, verbally, and somewhat physically. But I’ve felt this way even before him. I could go on and on about my involuntary existence, but the real reason I’m typing this right now is because I had to do something to get my mind off taking all of my pills at once. Yesterday I poured them all in my cupped hands and it looked like enough to do the job, and since then, I cannot get that picture out of my head. I do think I should admit myself into a mental institution, but you know what that means.. more money from dad.. way way way more money. And I just can’t take from him anymore. He has the rest of us to support. So what’ll I’ll do tonight? I’ll try to sleep.. wake up and sigh, rinse, and repeat. If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate that. Because no one. And I mean no one, has gotten this much raw emotion from me. Hell, I might just share this with my loved ones to give an insight of how far from ok I really am.

What should I do?,"Hello everyone. I’m Deniz, Male, 18 years old from Germany. It’s just I don’t know what to do. I think I need help. I tried to talk to my mother many times but she always says “it’s just a phase you don’t even know what real problems are”
Well I’m keep saying myself that she’s right, it’s just a phase but I don’t know. I want to know your opinions too. There’s this feeling, this emptiness inside me. It follows me at this high intensity now for 3 months. But I think it started way earlier. Well I don’t really know what I feel if I’m honest. What I want, what I search. I have no clue what I’m doing. Even now. I feel lonely but don’t want to do anything with anyone. I’m slowly losing all my friends too. I can’t do anything anymore. It’s like something is blocking me. Things I daily did like playing piano, going to the gym, is now impossible for me. I look at my piano and I’m kinda scared of touching it. I’m gaining weight, already 86kg now(I’m just 172cm). All I do now is laying in my bed and playing video games.

I think I experienced trauma as a kid and I don't know what to do,"I don't even understand my own thoughts.

I think a couple years back when i was 12-13, my aunt tried to sexually assault me.
We were in a parking lot, and she was walking behind me laughing. And she ran up to me in public and started rubbing against me behind my back. My memory is very fuzzy but I remember saying ""Stop."" and ran forward ahead of her.

Instantly that moment I was uncomfortable, and I tried to avoid her that entire trip.
I told her I wanted to go home, and that's when I was terrified.
I'm pretty sure she was drunk by the way she drove and her breath.
Once I got home she kept asking over and over if I wanted to go to the store with her which I in return kept firmly saying no.

After that our relationship crumbled, I kept rejecting her asks to hang out with me and I hated her.
I have told nobody.

I am terrified because I don't even know if I was sexually abused.
I am terrified because I can't even trust my own thoughts.
If I tell anyone my entire family will become more fucked up then it is.
People think I hate my aunt because I'm an asshole and not because of a specific reason.

"Numb and career success, relationships and alcohol have all failed to medicate it","I’ve always been a bit of an emotionally numb person, even as a child I struggled to find things I enjoyed. 

As I grew older I’ve tried a whole range of things to spark some kind of positive emotion, whether that’s trying sports, hobbies, socialising or other interests and nothing has ever made me truly happy.

The only reason I even know what I feel is abnormal is because a few things were able to make me feel some spark inside me, usually whenever I had some sort of large success such as finding a girlfriend, a new job or buying a home. But otherwise, it’s just emotional white noise.

At risk of sounding as though I’m trying to boast, I am in my early twenties and have achieved these things, I’m in a senior position at a large company, yet I feel either numb or miserable all the time and not all like I am successful. None of it was ambition, just desperation to achieve to feel something good for once.

Then I turned to alcohol, which is still the only thing that can consistently give me some positive buzz, but I quickly needed more and more and I’m worried how this will go.

I used to be depressed about being single, but now having a girlfriend has not actually impacted my mood at all, I briefly enjoyed the emotional and physical sides of it but this too I quickly built ‘tolerance’ to.

I’ve tried therapy and numerous antidepressants but none of it would make my problem go away.

What’s wrong with me? All my life only big successes could make me happy, it’s like the threshold for what I need to get a tiny dose of happiness is extremely high and it drives me insane.

Life's spiralling downwards,"Please ignore the typos :(

I fucking hate this so much. I'm tired of waking up everyday. I have my final exams going on and have my math paper tomorrow, but there's so much on my mind that I can't study. I'm gonna end up scoring really bad. 

I'm tired of my bf acting like he's the savior I've been needing. His name means happiness so he thinks he can make me happy. All he's ever done is make me sad and feel less of a person. He makes me feel like I'm a 'broken' person who needs 'fixing' because of bad past experiences. He keeps telling me ""I'm your happiness"". I get that he's trying to help me but it doesn't work. I've told him plenty of times but he just wouldn't stop. I feel like I'm just a depressed person not a person with depression. If that's all I am then I just want to die. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and see him there. I feel bad because he's really nice sometimes.

I was raised in a conservative home so naturally I'm a conservative and yeah idm it. He knows this. It's only been 3 months to our relationship and he said he wants to make out with both of us ""shirtless"". I'm sorry if I'm being a prude here but I'm not comfortable. I'm just not comfortable. I told him no repeatedly but he kept pushing the idea onto me, I told him in not comfortable and that it's escalating too quickly. This happened last night. I'm probably overeating but I'm hurt because when you trust someone but they ignore your consent, it's kinda scary. I feel so fucking weak. Every sexual abuse victim is so fucking strong. Ik this is absolutely nothing compared to what they've been through but idky I just feel unheard. I told him no eight times before he finally heard me. I'm sorry I'm just generally uncomfortable with people. 

Today, he's just behaving as if nothing happened. I told him about last night and how uncomfortable it made me feel but he just said ""you're overthinking"". I feel bad because I can't give him what he wants but I'm sorry, I'm so fucking sorry I'm not comfortable. This has had such a negative effect on my psyche. I was super stressed about the exams and now I have this pretty insignificant incident just looming over my head. 

My family problems keep getting worse. My grandma is a fucking bitch who has done nothing but destroy my home. (My paternal gm lives with us because she can't sustain herself.) My mom wants a divorce but the only reason she's not getting it is because I'm still a high school student and I don't wanna be stuck between a custody battle. I really wish I could just kill myself so my mom could finally leave this hell of a home. My dad's really attached to his mother and he won't say anything against my gm. 

My elder who is studying in another state said I would never be successful. That kinda hurt. When I told my 'bff' I was suicidal, she just said ""can you not"". That was unexpected, she didn't apologise. After 5 months or so she said ""I should've been nicer to Dan. Oh you too"". OH YOU TOO, THAT'S ALL? I lose my only emotional support back then and that's all she had to say. That was around the time I met my bf so ig that's why he sees me as someone who needs constant support. He keeps saying ""I'm here and I'll make you happy"". I just feel super unconscious now. I'm sorry, I'm probably overeating but I don't want to fucking wake up tomorrow. 

I really want to kill myself. I recently moved back to self harm again. Self harm, weed and wine seem to be the only things that comfort me these days.

Tdlr: my bf makes me feel really uncomfortable, family problems keep getting worse. My grades suck, my final exams are going and I'll probably mess them up too. I have too many breakdowns and I might have minor addictions. I just wish to die.",t2_18glscku,3,0

I have done this as long as I can remember. I honestly believe that I'm a waste of space and energy. Counseling from 7 to 21 didn't get me anywhere and neither did being medicated. The times I tried to take my life were when I was medicated so I feel like if medicine doesn't even work then it's hopeless. I honestly just wish a freak accident would happen and end me. I'm a burden on my family and I haven't had a friend since I graduated which was 10 years ago so people don't want me around either. I've tried reaching out for help but no one will reply back.

How do I forgive myself.,"so  

i've been smoking weed for 2 years straight. Started in 11th grade, and im now 19. this has caused me to pretty much completely lose my memory from my childhood. 

I started smoking (probably) due to my porn addiction which was slowly rotting my brain for the majority of my life (found porn at very young like 5). I was always stimulating myself with video games and porn growing up, so when I discovered weed it had this magical attribute to it that made me feel like ME.

So through smoking, I helped ""cure"" myself so that I could live my life happily but secretly I was still indulging in porn. I was still sabotaging my spirit. The porn escalated to showing my privates live on cam sites (idk why, it actually scared me to do this) for the thrill that I'm exchanging a sexual act with someone else.

I got addicted to this for some reason and just started jerking off with men. Note, I believe that I am straight and am just into the exhibition side of this addiction, which was another mental war I had with myself. I could never imagine a genuine relationship with another man.   

I've smoked an unreal amount of weed for my age. Over an oz a week at times. This led me to be completely broke, even though I've had 6 temporary jobs throughout my highschool career. I should have around $30k+ total if I completely saved, but I'm typing this with $0.  This has also resulted in absolutely zero motivation to do anything with my time besides play videogames and escape.

Recently, I have been taking psychedelics (mushrooms) and long story short I believe I am re-aligned with my spiritual self, except I am broken from all the bullshit I've done. By killing my spirit through addiction I have pushed all of my friends away, am disconnected more than ever from my family, and my girlfriend broke up with me. I show no motivation and clearly don't care anymore. My family wants to help but only after I reached out.  

I'm only writing this post bc I just looked into the mirror and felt so disconnected that it scared me.",t2_27utkj2e,3,0
Cannabis Use Disorder / Possible Driver Licence Suspension,"Feeling really stressed, confused, and angry right now.

Just got out of my appointment with my psychiatrist and he said I may be dealing with depression, anxiety, and addiction. I told him during a depressive episode a few month ago i had intrusive thoughts while driving. My head was full of suicidal thoughts then and I felt an urge to ram into the opposite lane, but of course did not act on those thoughts. We have been meeting for a while now and has urged me to cut my cannabis use down. I vape multiple times a day and its definitely a “problem”. 

For the past 2 weeks i have been not sleeping or eating well/regularly. Using a lot of cannabis and drinking a lot caffeine in an attempt to get my schoolwork deadlines on time. I am late for 6 projects and was so stressed out last week I didn’t take my meds and was a very chaotic time. I am still working on getting my assignments in and pass my school but today during our appointment he said that he has to report that I am a substance abuser to the government and the ministry may suspend my licence to drive. I know he is support to help me but I feel like I am being stabbed in the back and is giving my life a lot of inconveniences at a really stressful time. He said its his legal obligation and that it is a wake up call for me but idk i feel really scared of it leaving a record on my licence, increasing insurance or my family finding out that my licence is suspended cause of cannabis abuse. No i never drive under the influence, i barely drive and don’t own a car atm just driving my family when i visit them

I’m going to eat something its already 3pm, 9 hours left to get on my work. Idk, weed helps me feel better in the short term but he said it drains my energy and my saps my creativity. I have a hard time stopping using and my use increases significantly in times of stress.

Does depression always feel the same?,"I've had depression in the past, and that included self harm, not wanting to do anything, alienating myself from all of my friends and family, and genuinely just not caring about myself or anything i do. I went to therapy and took zoloft and i think that did help, although it definitely changed me as a person.

Flash forward to now and i don't necessarily feel *that bad.* I feel down and alone often, but it doesn't ""*hurt*"" like it did before.  I haven't seriously considered self harming, but i do always feel tired and it takes a lot for me to finally decide i want to do something. I actually just canceled my vacation i already paid for and was supposed to go on yesterday because i started feeling super anxious over it. Sometimes i do just think about running away and not telling anyone so i can be alone, but then i realize that i'll just be alone in a different place.

We're still friends. Which is great but also mind numbing hard. I try to be strong around her and show her that I can be what she needs if she likes guys. I just want to be able to love her instead of having to hide it.

I got it planned out,"So I’m putting this here because I’ve honestly thought about it and want peoples opinions

So little back story here

I have been dealing with depression my entire life and my life has been crappy. I recognize that others have it worse and I feel for them. Anyway, I have ptsd, big polar depression, anxiety, and borderline psychotic (I was told that but idk if it actually exists) 

I’ve also been molested and used my entire life and my dad told me when I was 5 that I ruined his life and he wants nothing to do with me anymore and then left. My mom resents me for that and my brother and sister also resent me due to the fact my mom cheated on their dad with my dad and I’m hated for that. 

During school I was bullied everyday and came home with black eyes as well as bruises on my body while my mom would drink and never let me in or gave me a chance to talk to her. I also got into a relationship where I was cheated on constantly and used as well as used to get a kid (she poked holes and stopped the birth control. But she and I live with each other because I want to be there for him and not pay child support and see my son , yes he is mine surprisingly, instead of half my check going and I see my son once a month. 

Before I say my plan I just want to say it may sound selfish but at this point in life i am done and my son deserves better. Oh i also had to drop out of college after working 2 full time jobs and taking care of my son while doing 5 classes because his mom doesn’t want to work or really anything aside from he at home and it was either quit my jobs and finish my degree and struggle for 3 more years and possibly get a job and lose my apartment car etc. or leave college and make money to support my son now.

Into the plan

So I’m 21 and just found out today I was fired from my job that I’ve been at for 6 months and put so much time in. I would work 120 hours and only get paid for half but stuck with it because it was the only source of income. Also found out I can’t go back to school because I owe my school student loans now (I planned on going back this next year but now that’s not possible) along with ball of this my depression is getting worse (I have tried to go to a therapist but I missed 2 appointments because of my job and was almost fired for it and yes I did schedule the days off but being a manager I couldn’t say no to call ins or anything without losing my job.)

So I’m broke, can’t get mental help, I’m not allowed to really go out and find an outlet because my sons mom makes me feel guilty and i feel tied down to my apartment because my son is fragile and I feel I can’t leave to work out walk or anything outside of my place. I can’t do a lot inside my apartment but I have a small place (3 suv sizes) and my son wants to play and interrupts every time I try to work out write or do something I enjoy. I don’t mind it it’s actually kind of cute but you could see how it could get annoying. 

Anyway here’s my plan forgive me if it sounds selfish.

Im thinking on killing myself NOT NOW OR SOON BUT IN 6 or 10 years. 

I plan on making enough money to pay my debts off, get money for my son to go to school and be taken care of as well as have enough money to pay his tuition and college.  Also be able to get a house and pay it off and leaving it to my son and his mom as well as make sure they’re both fully taken care of without me. 

After I have erased my debts and made enough money for my son to go to college and have a house to live in. I also plan on getting cremated and having myself turn into a necklace or some type of jewelry or anything for my son to keep. As well as make sure my family has nothing to pay for when I’m gone.

I’m gonna buy a old junk car and make sure it’s faulty and make my death look like a car accident so my son won’t feel guilty. 

This has just been a fantasy and might make it happen if it gets worse. But I’ve been planning this for the last few years.

TLDR:

I have a lot of mental problems and can’t go to a therapist for another year, was screwed my entire life so far and was used to have a kid that I wouldn’t know was mine for a year. Was cheated on by a girl I loved and still do  but continuously getting screwed. Dad left when I was 5 and was told it was because of me and my mom as well as brother and sister resent me. 

So I’m thinking about ending my life after my debt is paid my family doesn’t have to pay for anything and make sure my son is taken care of for the rest of his life and make it look like an accident so he doesn’t blame himself for my death.",t2_9m8f6o3,1,0

"Chronic Loneliness, need advice [28m]","I have tons of thoughts about my situation, but I’m going to try and explain everything as clearly as possible.

I got out of a pretty destructive long term relationship almost a year ago, that ended purely because my ex being bi-polar and unmedicated. I did my best to stay positive, got my own apartment, promotion at work, lost 50lbs and really tried hard to maintain a positive outlook.

Along with this though, became me being cut off from her friend group and family as well. I have a very tight nit group of friends that have unfortunately all moved far away. We keep in contact and plan trips, but I rarely see them.

Fast forward 4 months, I fall into a depression and MAJOR ocd episode that I am just now getting out of thanks to my own efforts and therapy. It was pure fucking hell to do alone and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

I try to be social. I make a point of hanging out with coworkers at least 1-2 times a week, I go to weekly social events and try my best to hang with friends on the weekends.

My issues is, I cannot maintain new friendships nor do I get invited to events really unless I’m the one planning them and even then people are hella flakey. I have social anxiety and small talk is hard but I try my best and sometimes do okay.

I am not connecting with anyone on a deeper level and it is driving me into another depression and I’m legitimately scared. I’ve gotten dates with online apps but it feels like tons of effort and usually just fails before a date even happens because of my social anxiety. On top of this, living alone is adding pressure as I have no one to vent to or just talk with at the end of the day.

I need advice, I’m in therapy but constantly talking about this is not helping the situation actually get fixed (as I am and have been maintaining constant efforts to fix this). Maintaining a positive mindset is not as well due to my social anxiety causing most of these issues. Is this just a fucking test?

Could my depression get worse if I stop taking meds for two weeks?,"Last month my psychiatrist gave me two perscriptions so I won't run out of my pills because she's now unavailable for the next two weeks and I can't have an appointment. But I didn't realize I had only a month to buy the meds anyway and now the perscription is outdated. I know I screwed that myself, but I just noticed yesterday that I don't have almost anything left. 

I only take this meds (50mg sertraline) for two months and it started to work but the results are not the best yet. But I worry that if I will stop now they will be gone and I'd feel even worse, not to mention I will have to get used to it again. I have only one pill left and I could split it in half and take it every other day but that's it. Also I don't want to go to another doctor since they don't know my situation and doctors in the clinic that I go to aren't also available for the next 10 days, so I don't think that makes any difference.

 I also take pregabalin for anxiety and I ran out of it too but it's something that only works when I take it and not a long term like sertraline. Even though it's going to be difficult for me without it.

In truth, homework actually makes you less likely to do well in a subject/test because at home you don’t have the same motivation to study as you do at school, even if like me you hardly have any motivation to do anything anyway.

"I stay up late because if I’m tired during the day, it’s not so bad","I have five and a half hours till my alarm. Then I have school. A seven hour day ahead. I love sleep because it is the only time I’m completely free from my depressing thoughts. Luckily my depression doesn’t appear in my dreams. My dreams are sometimes really fun. 
But the point is, I don’t want to sleep because I want to be tired. Is this self harm in a way idk. And I don’t care.

Im just opening up while i am drunk,"I have felt so empty and even tried suicide in these few years, so here is what has happened to me:  
I was bullied in school for 12 years, when i was 15 my grandpa died (that one happens to everyone but he was at the time the most important human in my life because my parents were not the best ones) my first girlfriend got  brutally murdered (tortured) when we were 16, two years later my second gf blocked me everywhere and disappeared from my life, still dont know where she is, when i was 19 i had an crush on a very good friend of mine, i planned to confess on her birthday.... she committed suicide before that.

i’ve gone through all of the hardest things one could go through over the last year and there is STILL nobody here for me,"i’m not going through pain for attention, or validation. i don’t want to be in pain. i don’t want to feel empty. 

but it’s scary knowing that at from age 17-18:

-i starved myself down to 89 lbs
-attempted suicide
-was hospitalized multiple times
-ruined a 3+ year relationship with my boyfriend
-had to somehow finish and graduate high school
-was forced to move from my hometown that i lived in for 18 years
-my separated parents both moved into new houses with their new spouses
-i withdrew my college applications and didn’t go to school in the fall
-my grandmother died of cancer in december 

i’ve been on the edge of insanity for a year and nobody seems to even try to be there for me, it feels like nobody cares that much, nobody wants to do anything about how i feel or ask me how i am even though they know i’m hurting and i’ve asked for help so many times. 

my parents don’t want to be responsible for me anymore, i’m legally an adult now, when i attempted suicide it was a burden to them, my mom yelled at me. “how could i bring this hurt into her life?” 

is it normal for people to not care despite going through this many things at such a young age and in such a short period of time? i don’t know what’s normal anymore, I’ve started expecting less and less of others because i always get let down. i just don’t know if i can go through life this way",t2_3lbmn7pi,1,0
Can depression lead to cognitive issues?,"Hey all. I'm vastly sick right now (hopefully not COVID-19) so I might be typing a little incoherently... but since I have 2 weeks off, I need y'alls help! I'm not sure if this belongs here but it relates more to mental health/depression than school, but let me know if it doesn't. I'll gladly direct it to the right subreddit. 

OK. I know depression a lot because it's been a \*\*\*\* in my life, but I also don't know a lot. My friend has depression along with PTSD, but she's in a much better state thanks to years of therapy. She's practically in a better state than me because she's highly functional, social, living well, can seek and find joy, etc. However, I've noticed something really weird. We're both in the same college. She's smart. When I talk to her, gosh, she can paint a story and explain herself better than I can (and people think I'm brilliant at it). She doesn't know what anxiety is when talking to me or other people. But the odd thing is that... we shared a class last semester, and she was accused of plagiarism. I don't know what went down but since she got an F on the final and an A- in the whole class, I didn't make a big deal out of it. But she got accused of plagiarism AGAIN today. We only started talking more the past few weeks so I don't know her too well but I got all of her assignments and read through them. Half of them got good grades... the other half were accused of plagiarism. The professor, chair, and a few other professors are highly against her. I read their email. There's nothing pointing at plagiarism, at least from my little knowledge. Her writing style is the same throughout 10+ assignments. She paraphrases and cites wherever she could. These aren't analytical papers either; they're just summaries of what she had to read. OK. So I'm not seeing it but maybe there is an issue. The professor specifically said she plagiarized OFF other students. I once shared an assignment with her and I def. noticed she somewhat copied my assignment (same examples, same points). But the really odd thing is that just last week, she was telling me how someone else was copying her paper word for word, she told the girl to stop, the girl didn't, she flipped out, and got her paper back. A bunch of students saw the fight. She told the professor what happened. 

OK so. Is it possible that she plagiarizes without knowing it? Is there some kind of cognitive dissonance/dysfunction related to depression/PTSD? I do not doubt her in character. She's sweet, smart, and jesus christ, the only person who can talk to me, be empathetic, understand me. Everything. But I do wonder if she's plagiarizing without knowing. I haven't asked her because I'm suspecting she does not have a clue she's plagiarizing. If she can point it out to others, but can't see it in herself... that sounds like some kind of psychological issue that I do not know of. The event has also triggered her depression so I told her to not think about it for the rest of the week. The only reason why I'm offering help to her is because I see vast potential. One talk with her proves she's really smart and has had her obstacles, but damn has she overcome them! I also know the professor who gave her the F last semester, the chair, and a few other professors. I can sort this out because they know me and my character well. I also just want to say, it might sound like I'm invasive but I truly care. She said she'll let me figure it out too. I've suffered in the hands of injustice in my school, and I don't want anyone else to suffer the same way. 

I dare not post this in more school-related subreddits because I know they'll trash me. ""Plagiarism is plagiarism."" I can give 1,000 examples of how crazy life can be and how much control we could NOT have over ourselves, our minds, and our brains. I've had my own experiences with some things that are outright wrong but no one ever blamed me because they know what happened! I'm only posting this here because I know the contributors are much more understanding and open-minded! 

Thanks! Even if you don't know what the real problem is, you could just say anything. I'm sure I can get some leads just from your comments!  

Again - if this is not posted in the right place, let me know and please redirect me! Thanks!",t2_59v2wywc,1,0
Getting Older with No Relationship Experience,"So I'm a 27 male, average build, decent looking. I'm mainly depressed because I'm heading towards 30 with a handful of crappy Tinder flings. I've never had a girlfriend, and it's making me concerned that I might actually die alone.

I have only used dating apps so far and I'm sick of them. I have gone out with around 20 women over the last 3 years, but I have never had a second date even though the first dates always end with them saying they had a good time. I have only seen the girl again if we had sex on the first date, otherwise I just get ghosted.

I just feel like I will never ""figure it out"" when it comes to flirting or dating. I have a harder time warming up to people due to a lot of negative family in my life that I cut out, but taking things slower doesn't seem to be accepted in modern dating, it's fast and furious.

I'm also not saying I can't talk to people. I actually was promoted to a supervisor position recently. My social circle is basically people I work with and we go out sometimes and joke around a lot.

I have tried going to nightclubs, Meetups, and so on, and have attempted asking a girl out on a few occasions, but I'm not sure how to go about it on a regular basis.

Depression related absences,"TW: Self-harm, Suicide 

Sooo yeah every semester it’s the same shit. I use up all of my free absences and occasionally go over one or two. But this semester has been extremely tough on me and my mental health. I even came really close to suicide yesterday and self-harmed pretty bad. On top of that, my insomnia has been at its absolute worst and between school and work, I’m just not sleeping. 

I have one professor who allows us 4 absences and I’ve only used 3 there. Two that allow us two absences and I’ve used both + 1. And my 4th professor who only allows us 1 and I’ve used 3... 

1 absence for a class that meets twice a week is simply ridiculous to me. So far she hasn’t dropped me from her class but I’m afraid she’ll fail me at the end of the semester without warning. I emailed her but she hasn’t replied. I’m honestly really scared and anxious because an F will ruin my GPA which I’ve worked EXTREMELY hard to maintain. 

I’d talk to my psychiatrist but because of school and work, I completely bailed on her and stopped taking my meds (they made me extremely suicidal). I’m scared that if I go back to her, asking for a medical excuse, that she’ll refuse because I haven’t been to see her. I really don’t know what to do.

Edit:

Despite the absences, I’m doing really well in my classes and have good grades. So my professors can’t complain there. I always turn my work in on time and do everything I’m supposed to.",t2_zjk3t,1,0

my roommate is depressed and i dont know how to help,"let me preface this my saying im bipolar (diagnosed). i know depression, ive spent days in bed and called in bc i cant find the will to even dress myself. but even with my knowledge, i dont know how to help my roommate/best friend

hes gone through a lot of stress these past couple of months - an emergency has left him with a lot of medical debt, hes having relationship issues, and now his wisdom tooth growing in has gotten infected and he needs oral surgery, which will leave him with even more debt. i understand why he would be depressed

he used to hang with me in the common area most of the time, but now he just stays in his room. he drinks a lot (like a lot). today i got him to open up a little and he says he wouldnt blame his gf is she was cheating on him bc hes 'a piece of shit'

in the 2 years ive lived with him, ive never seen him this bad. hes cried more in the past week than ive seen in the entire time ive known him. ive tried to use my own experience to talk with him, but he seems convinced that even showing me emotions is a sign that hes weak. he also told me that he had been counting on him not being alive past 30 (hes 35 now)

i mentioned the idea of talking to a therapist, and he gave a noncommittal answer, but im sure it meant he had no intention of talking to anyone

im worried.  ive never seen him like this. hes talking like i was talking during my Bad Days. i have a psych i can talk to, but i guess he only has me

what do i do? what can i say to help, or to convince him to see someone? im so worried and scared, hes my closest friend and i hate to see him like this

"I'm depressed because my sister and her newborn were almost beat to death while I was in the house, and I did nothing to stop it.","It happened so suddenly, and I don't know why. While my sister was giving her 11 day old son a bath, her boyfriend came into our house, walked into the bathroom, locked the door, and started beating her mercilessly. I only heard a crash in the bathroom, so I ran over to the bathroom and kicked the door open to see my sister on the ground, blood gushing from her face with her baby on the ground. I went down to help her and pulled out my phone, which that man then took from me. While he went over to my younger sister to try and get hers I just could only think to get a neighbors help. I ran out and found a phone to call the cops with. He ran out of the house shortly after and headed into the woods, where he was later arrested.

It's been awhile since it happened, but being her brother (even though younger) I have never gotten over the fact that I didn't bash that guys skull in or do something. But I didn't, I just ran. Although she tells me to this day there was nothing I could've done I don't believe that, and I don't know if I ever will. My depression stems from mainly knowing that everyone else was thinking I should've done something to help, to stop him from doing that. It's just unfair. Why was I put into this situation? Why me? Why do people have to be so evil? I hate that this is the way my life is and has ended up.",t2_yug44,43,0

26 year old male at the biggest transition of my life and struggling mentally and with injuries. Life story type post,"This is a long and poorly organized sort of semi story of my life. I am doing a lot of reflecting and soul searching and I just feel like typing this out. I've never shared anything like this before or put these things in detail for myself. It isn't all bad stuff, more extreme struggle at the moment and attempting to put the good and bad into perspective I have a lot going on in my life and thought I would roughly share my story. I am at the biggest transition in my life and am struggling,  I did not think it would turn out this way. I'm a 26 year old male. I have a middle class family. My parents are both in their late 60s. My mom is overall a great parent. My dad doesn't deserve the title in any capacity and has the mentality of a child. Mom despises him and there is no reason they should be together but I guess it's just simpler that way. I have one brother who is 35 and has a pretty good job as support in the tech industry.

I had social anxiety from very early on. In preschool I would hide behind a tree at recess everyday and I'd cry when we had to sing songs. My extreme fascination/obsession with girls started in elementary school. I remember crying over crushes I knew I would never have; girls that at the most I would have the courage to say hi to once or twice but always build it up in my head. In middle school I had extremely strong feelings of wanting to be a girl and feeling like it just fit my personality much better (still have some of that lingering). I had my first kiss in middle school and I had quite a handful of kisses in high school. In fact, for all my anxiety and lack of trying, I had a good handful of pretty attractive women, and a few very attractive ones offer a sexual relationship with me. At the time I couldn't go through with it. I wanted it, but I was afraid of everything to go along with it.  Idk if it's because I didn't have any strong conversations with a dad or something but I just wasn't making the most of things. I had my first date and talk ever with an attractive woman a few months ago, we weren't compatible but it was nice to get experience. It is hard to unravel what my extreme hold up to giving myself a fair shot in relationships is, but it feels like I am so in incredible awe of the attractive female form that my immediate reaction is always that they would never want me. There is literally nothing I want more and I feel like I don't bring anything to the table for them.

All of this said I have had consistent passions in my life that got me this far. I have had A LOT of enjoyment, fun, and excitement in my life; or at least my fair share by far considering I haven't put in much hard work. Music has been a passion of mine since early high school. I did the guitar classes and performances, played in rallies, and got some minor recognition for that. I got a degree in music at the community college. I had piano lessons as a kid and was able to expand on that some. I began teaching guitar, piano, and ukulele privately and that went on for a few years. I got up to about 15 students per week. I have also written a handful of reviews on a music rating website.

I also love soccer. I have been a youth soccer referee doing pretty much as many games as I can every season for the past 10 years straight. I only played rec growing up but I have always been a fast runner (I did track for 2 years in high school as well). I have refereed high school soccer the last four seasons and have refereed over 200 high school games alone in that time (I did 68 this season that just concluded). I have been in the soccer classes at the communities colleges several times.

Lastly I LOVED video games. I was at the right age to be in the golden age of online competitive games like Halo 2, Halo 3, Gears of War, COD MW 2, and more recently Rocket League.

Now for the more recent developments and getting towards the point.In high school I always wanted to get all the homework done well but I never wanted to necessarily excel or think about my academic future. I got mostly As in high school but didn't strive to make it matter. I wanted to do the work so that went well and then get back to playing video games. It is funny looking back because both ways my social life really suffered because I mainly focused on those two things. After I got the music degree I drifted around for about a year and a half not doing much academic. Then in 2017 I felt like I really needed direction and I decided to pursue dental hygiene, not because I have any experience in any type of serious profession, especially the dental field, but I could tell it was a good career. In 2018 I did all the science prereqs to get in. I wanted to go to the community college but it is so hard to get in their lottery system that I have gone for a for-profit school program instead. I could have started last September but I decided to delay so I could play and referee more soccer (I know right).

Things have gotten rough. In 2017 I decided I was going to really improve my guitar playing. I played so much that I got like tennis elbow or forearm tendonosis or something. My forearm hasn't been stable since. It is always tight, but playing guitar immediately makes the arm flare up for a week or so, so I had to stop playing guitar completely. I also can't play video games, lift weights, do pushups, hold the computer mouse too long...In 2019 I decided to take a yoga class. The forward fold pose really hurt my back. Then I got my lumbar spine moved slightly to the side in a mosh pit in May 2019. It hurt pretty bad but the chiropractor was able to use the adjustment table to put it back into place. But it has been unstable on and off with a low ache lasting weeks at a time since. I then was playing soccer in September 2019 and headed the ball and got a concussion that lasted about two weeks.Now, two and a half weeks ago in February 2020 at my indoor soccer class a guy elbowed me in the rib. I went into a rage (totally uncharacteristic of me) and I fell trying to go after him and I hit the wall. A few minutes later I headed the ball and got another concussion.The last two weeks have been the worst of my life. I didn't get pain or a bump from the hit to the head but ever since I have been depressed, a little lightheaded, and have slight headaches. Maybe worse, my neck doesn't hurt but it feels slightly forward and tight and just off. When I move my neck to the left it always clicks on the way back. My knees are also starting to hurt for no reason. My back has really been acting up a lot too.

I was officially accepted into the dental hygiene program yesterday. And I am having to give up guitar, playing soccer, and video games because of injury. Basically I am having to shed all aspects of what I enjoyed in my younger self to reinvent myself. I also struggle with motivation. I am addicted to my phone, youtube videos, and listening to music. I need to make that not dominate my life and make something of myself. I have lived with my parents my whole life and really need to change. So I have put off my forearm issue for too long and it may interfere with the dental hygiene career, but I am going to start physical therapy. I have no health insurance so my option is to pay a private physical therapy practice. I also feel like as a male I am especially useless to anyone unless I make something great out of myself, even a basic job won't suffice because you can't really move out on your own unless you have a really great job.

So essentially this is feeling like a classic tale of having to reinvent yourself. I put off really getting a great start because I was still doing a lot that I loved and nothing else interested me. But now I am especially so conscious of how things must change. What has made it so hard is the chronic pain. I still have 7 weeks before school starts, and it will be an intensive full time job. I need to do whatever it takes to get healthy. It is amazing seeing all the incredibly dark and dreadful places the mind can go when your life goes certain ways. Being in this concussed, stressed about the future state with several aching pains that have lasted weeks makes it feel like this dread will never end. But I can hope it will and do all the things I can do to make it better. And maybe someday this will be more like a memory that made me stronger. Just writing this out has been a good exercise that put things in perspective and gave me optimism. I guess what I can hope to gain from anyone commenting is if they relate or especially if they have recovered from any of these pains like forearm pain, back pain, neck pain, and concussion lasting at least a couple weeks.

On the hopelessness of life.,"First of all, I'm not officially diagnosed and from a third world country so not priviliged enough to suffer :D

This is just my subjective experience. I feel like my life is shy from a literal miracle, utterly hopeless, but I can't tell anyone because no one can get inside my head and change or experience life through my lens, on top of that, I feel like the idea of just living day in and day out waiting for it to end, not enjoying or looking up ahead to anything, waking up already disgusted and burdened by your existence is a bizzare  and alien idea to most people, despite the illusion that it's normal and widespread on the internet. 


I'm 23, male, college student. I've dropped in and out in the past five years to due a lot of reasons that I'd summarise as: I fucking hated every second there and it's wrecked my mental health and on top of that didn't learn anything valuable.


So, yeah, I don't think I have depression, my life just sucks, I think a therapist would infantilses this or simply be helpless and throw drugs and good intentions at the problem and hope it goes away. I think having healthy habits, a good diet, working through your cognitive and behavioural maladaptations is important, but they don't solve problems, they just calm and pacify. But why should anyone not want to turn their life around and make it enjoyable instead of putting up with whatever it throws at you? This ties back at the core of why I feel hopeless - I know life is enjoyable, I know that suffering isn't all there is to it, yet being poor, having failed to get a degree, having no skills. It's hard and there is no way out.

I hope I didn't kill anyone's vibe by this, I just have no one to tell about this.",t2_i8hm5,1,0

I have no idea why he was so mad, but Smiley's family always knew when he was. Smiley's daddy also liked to drink, a lot. And when his daddy would drink, he'd get really angry, and then people would get hurt. Smiley knew this was going on, and it scared him. I don't know when it all started, but I do know that he was only 4 or 5 when he came into the living room after hearing a commotion to find his mommy, bruised and bloodied, laying motionless on the floor and his daddy standing over her. Smiley tried to help her. He never got hit, but he was thrown across the room. Next his big brother stepped in, and Smiley watched his dad punch and kick his brother down the hallway. Things like this happened a lot, but this time has always stuck with him the most. He definitely never tried to step in again. 

The abuse went on like this for a few years. Occasionally, they would go on camping trips without dad to get a few days of peace. Things would be different for a short time after returning, but his dad would always find a reason to get mad eventually. Smiley never got hit, well at least never closed fist hit. He'd get the belt if he got out of line, though. He was so little at the time, but he knew it was only a matter of time. He was so scared and he just wanted to feel safe, so he made up a little game. I call it mouse. He started pretending that he was a mouse, and there were rules that had to be followed at all times. 

1 Don't be seen. If he's never seen or noticed, daddy might not hurt him. 

2 Never ask for anything. If you do, dad might get mad because dad doesn't like spending money. 

3 Never complain, or argue or really make any sound because you don't want to be noticed. Being seen or noticed is bad. 

Smiley got good at the game. Really good. He spent as much time as he possibly could in his room. Door open, of course, his daddy didn't like closed doors or secrets. He had a bookshelf just stacked high with all kinds of adventures he could go on. That's almost all he ever did. He hid away and felt safer. Eventually, Smileys mom and dad got divorced and no one had to be scared anymore. I was so relieved. Finally, a chance for Smiley to have a normal childhood. 

Smiley, safe now, thought everything was OK. He knew that his brother and sister and his mom were doing bad because of everything that happened to them, but he thought that since he was never really beaten, he wasn't affected by it. You see, Smiley didn't know until years later what his sister was going through. And now, his mom was so focused on getting Smiley's brother and sister the help they needed, and smiley never really showed immediately obvious signs of trauma, that he kind of got missed on getting a chance to deal with everything. He continued, business as usual. 

He made friends at school, it just took a while to feel comfortable around people. He never really felt comfortable being alone with people, especially men. But that seemed normal, you know, stranger danger and such. In high school, he even managed a serious girlfriend! I thought he was doing pretty well. He attended a local college and met his future wife. 


They hit it off right away. Over the course of 5 years, they dated, moved in together, and started working on a family. 3 kids a dog and a mortgage. They were living the American dream. It was always tough, socializing and fully loving and trusting another person and such, but it was most definitely worth the effort. Things felt like everything was going to be ok. 

But things weren't really OK. He couldn't see it at the time, but he was still playing mouse. He'd built his entire life around it. See, he had crafted, what he thought was, a perfect solution to the problem he was facing at a very young age. And he didn't realize that he was continuing to live like that as he grew up. Honestly, he had no clue how much his life was based around being afraid. He avoids uncomfortable conversations at all cost, because he doesn't want to make anyone angry. He hasn't really had any friends since graduating. Hes always felt like the third wheel anyway, so when he didn't see friends for a few days, he assumed the stopped wanting to be friends. 

Also, Smiley feels sad a lot. He knows what depression is, but he never really felt like he had a reason to feel sad, so it must be something else. He was on medication for a short time, but he felt like a fake or something. That he had no reason to feel sad, and he is just being a baby. Also he absolutely hated how the medicine made him feel, so he stopped taking it. He learned to embrace his sadness. It became just another part of who he was. He lived in it. He would make a point to replay every bad thing he could think of to make himself feel worse, because somehow, it felt good, comfortable even. It made him feel better to be sad, because no one could ever take that away. No matter what happend, he knew that he still had that. He finally had control over his emotions. Or so he thought. 

Do you know what happens when someone who feels like everyone is out to get him and that he somehow deserves it, realizes that the one thing in his life he was sure of, the only thing he felt he could always count on, isn't what he thought it was? I bet a lot of you do, actually. He took it hard. He always felt like he didn't have very far to fall, but he was oh so wrong. He learned just how much further he could fall. The woman with whom he'd spent the last 13 years, the love of his life, the woman he imagined growing old surrounded by grandchildren with, had an affair. EA/PA in fact. It had been going on for about a year, and she's in love with him. She said Smiley's emotionally distant. That he doesn't show his feelings. That she doesn't feel loved by him. It's almost certainly true. Not that he doesn't love her, but that he's just been really bad at showing it. 

It's been a year since D-Day. He feels very alone now. He feels more sadness than ever before, he tells me it hurts in the most horribly wonderful ways. But it's not all bad, right? This has forced him to look at himself in ways he never has before. He seems to want to gain control of his life. Maybe this is what he needed to get real control over his life. I just feel really bad for him. I've suggested repeatedly that he get into counseling, but as of yet, he hasn't. I hope he knows that there is someone who cares about him. I'm just really relieved this is all happening to him and not me, I don't think I'm strong enough to handle it all. 😊",t2_4nrr972u,1,0
My life is shit and it's my fault,"In a pretty useless worthless person really. I can't cope with a proper job or full time work. I trained for a career I was fired from in less than 9 months for not being good enough dispite pushing myself so hard I developed an eating disorder. Im so embarrassed by how I eat and know I should make changes but I don't. I just let myself exist in this shit life work a few hours at a shit job because I can't face a serious job, not working on my eating, not being a person worth being around for my partner. My life collapses like this ever time I try to make something of it and immediately to tired  to try again.

 I don't enjoy anything really and I don't do anything but the things I have to, stuff like sorting out the car insurance ect just doesn't get done. Im not looking after myself eg brushing teeth or showering enough. Iwanted to have a good job, have a house and a family but it's never going to happen, I wish I could die but that would hurt people who don't deserve it. So I carry on this subexistance to protect them, just fully putting one foot in front of the other and hoping every night that tomorrow does not come.

I just feel guilty for not pushing myself more, improving my life, building it back up. I feel guilty for just letting this be it.",t2_5wd5f08k,1,0
I cant do it anymore.,"I dont feel like continuing with life anymore. I'm 13, and I've been living on the brink of poverty my whole life, along with my family. For my 10th birthday, me and my family couldnt for anything. We had no money and lived in a homeless shelter. It destroyed my mentally. I knew the kids my age at school were on vacations to Cuba and lived in such big houses with food always available and cars that DO have air conditioning and dont need repairs and such. I've never had the opportunity to experience that.

I feel it's unfair. Why do I have to experience this but my peers dont? Why am I not able to live in a house? Why can't dad say yes everytime I ask him for something? He tells me ""I will see"" thinking it will make me feel a little better. But I've always knew the truth.

I'm 13 now. And we are doing a little better. We got out of the shelter and now live in a 1 room basement apartment. One room. For 4 people.

I dont want to experience any more of this. My mom tells me I'm a ""fighter"" for putting up with this my whole life. I cant fight it anymore. The voice is telling to me end it, and I cant resist longer.

I'm sorry if I sound spoiled.",t2_5h1f1jgc,2,0
i feel so alone again..,"i just cant stop fucking crying, it feels like the one person that cares so much, thatd send me a million messages before id wake up, thatd always want me to call in the morning, thatd always ask me whats on my mind or whats wrong, thatd be sad if i had to leave for a half hour just kind of moved on and found something better, im happy that theyve found happiness but i cant help but feel hollow again. i thought i found my reason to wake up in the morning but now i wake up completely alone this last week and i just feel right back to where i was before i met them. whats the point in trying, when you find hope its just fake, its just temporary. im back to living with my crippling depression. theres no point in trying, happiness is fading, the only constant is pain. i think im ready to just give up again, stick to the original plan, when my ma passes from this awful disease ill have nothing left to keep me from doing it.... dont ever fall in love, itll only crush you in the end.",t2_cnxm3,1,0

"Lack of work destroying my sleeping pattern, diet, motivation overall","Hi. To start off I’m just going to say I wouldn’t say I’m ‘depressed’ per se. I’m thankful that I don’t feel as low as I have done, and haven’t experienced some of the feelings and thoughts that I know lots of people in depression do. That being said, I was severely depressed around this time last year and for some time before that, stemming from working too much, doing none of what I love, and then eventually being made redundant for the 2nd year in a row whilst going through a very rocky time in my relationship at the same time. 

I went to therapy to help with this. I also started exercising again, something I hadn’t done for years, mainly because I couldn’t be bothered as I worked so much. While both these things helped me get a bit of focus, learn about myself in life and relationships, control my feelings and be in a better state of mind, I still haven’t managed to find another job in my field (teaching). Ive been limping along doing supply teaching since September. I really don’t enjoy it. It’s really unreliable, long term bookings have been abruptly cut short and I’ve had lots of periods of unemployment since September ‘19, ranging from anything from a week, to a month or several. Have struggled to get up in the morning so many times since then, in many cases just not being able to get up altogether and then spending the next day or two in bed, hardly eating, being up all night and asleep all day. This directly influenced one work booking being cancelled on one occasion. This has really got me down because I used to be so motivated, even with something I didn’t enjoy like supply teaching, I still tried to look at it as ‘at least it’s getting me up, about, doing something somewhat rewarding and productive, and allowing me to earn some money’. Lately I’ve been struggling more and more to adopt that same state of mind. 

In December I decided to go about changing my career. I applied to the work in the Police. Whilst this has given me more inspiration and drive to move forward, that career change is still in motion and it won’t start until at least June if not later. To achieve and maintain this career I’m going to need to get very fit and healthy and maintain a good diet to aid that. So sleeping pattern is everything. I know I can do it, but I feel like I need routine, and motivation to get up in the first place in order to get there. I’ve managed to get along the week before last, getting up early, eating well, exercising, being social, going to bed early etc, but after a while the motivation to do this just went out the window again.

At the moment I’m once again struggling to get work in supply teaching. Was meant to be working somewhere for 2 weeks starting from last week, which got cancelled this week. What I am struggling to bear at the moment is how these periods of unemployment keep ruining my motivation. I get down, end up ruining my sleeping pattern, this has a really bad affect on my diet and I keep losing weight and any progress I made from exercising, often just not going to the gym at all. I’m not happy with my weight, I want to put on more as I was really overweight before. The lack of work/ sleeping pattern/ exercise lately hasn’t helped my mood and I feel I’m quite irritable, unwilling to get up and have generally been isolating myself. I know I’ll be able to improve this once I begin the police training but until then... it’s really getting me down because in particular I felt like I made really good progress particularly in terms of my drive, motivation, and fitness, but keep falling down and going 2 steps back. When I’m feeling motivated I feel like nothing can touch me, I’m the most driven person out there. Then I wake up another morning and it’s just like that switch in my head has flipped, and I don’t see the point in getting up again. I’d like to go back to my therapist but I can’t afford it at the moment at all. 

Does anyone have any tips, thought processes etc that help them maintain sleep, diet, exercise patterns when they’re not feeling motivated or driven in life in general?

TLDR: unemployment ruining my health, mood, fitness, sleeping pattern and diet. Would really appreciate some advice. 

Thanks",t2_5pzwtmma,1,0

Finally coming to terms.,"Ok, I’m 24 years old. I’ve been dealing with depression and other mental illness for most of my life, but never told anyone because how I was raised was never deal or talk about my problems because I’m a male so it’s expected pretty much. But it’s now starting to eat at me slowly and slowly. I never really felt comfortable talking or opening up to anyone, because people always leave or are judgemental. I tend to always drive people away. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m the happiest person people say that brightens up there day but for me I’m not truly happy and it seems like I can’t be, if that makes any sense. Suicide always crosses my mind because I feel like I’m a burden to people and my parents. I’ve tried talking to a couple friends about my issues, but no one sees the pain I’m really going through. I can’t seem to connect with people though i feel so different in this world I just don’t belong here, my mind is so fucked. Right now in my life I just wanna stop breathing and make everything alright.

I feel so broken,"I've been crying for the past half hour. Harder than I've ever cried before. I'm a teen Male if that matters and the gist of the story is I was invited to hang out with some people, my crush (she knows I like her and as reciprocated similar feelings), and like 2 of her friends. She told me there was one person and that she didnt feel comfortable. I felt useful. Needed. I made up excuses to my parents and when to meet them. The second friend who I was not told about doesnt like me (idk why, we've never really spoken) and that's fine, I woulda gone. Go up to the car, they lock it and drive away. She said she was sorry and that she didnt know, but after I tried telling her how I felt she didnt seek to care and stopped texting. Ik its dumb but I've had a shitty day. After all this, I get some prank call from a girl who sounds like her (and im pretty sure it was her) basically telling me to eat a dick for a free iPhone. I've been listening to a song I showed her on repeat crying. I've written like 2 poems about how I'm feeling and I tried looking through my contacts for someone I can talk to. I couldnt find anyone.

I'm in so much pain,"First of all, fuck everything.

I have this thing where I go numb for a long while and I feel indifferent to everything bad that happens. Then, out of nowhere, all of the emotions suddenly come back, like a dam's cracked and then I feel emotional all day for no reason whatsoever.

I'm having one of these nowadays and good lord it fucking hurts. I can't bear it. 

I feel like an extra in my friend group(s) and I have this habit of just latching onto someone and then clinging onto them. Last week I had a heart-to-heart with a friend, like a 20 min convo, and then all of a sudden I felt myself clinging on to him. Like whenever I see him in a corridor at school I'll run over to him, always talk to him when we're in a group, constantly try to be around him etc. This isn't a crush, neither is it the first time. This has happened several times with a lot of people. I just latch on and then suddenly everything they do is very important and I use them to determine my self-worth.

Today I made a joke and he made a weird face and that's it, I just fucking spiralled into my emotions again. I was hit with how my parents don't give a fuck about me, how I'm failing my A-Levels (my grades are literally Us), how all my friends probably find me annoying as fuck. And now I am once again in a depressive episode despite being okay for so long.

Tbh I was never okay this entire time. I was hit with so many failures from all ends - my grades, my relationships, my lack of skills/talents/hobbies, my own personal life. I just felt numb for so long I just didn't care for a bit. And now it's hitting me all at once. 

I can't take this. It hurts like a motherfucker. I was walking home today and everytime I crossed a road I thought, I literally cannot care less if a vehicle hit me rn. Like just do it. I'm a failure and I hate myself. Everything is cruel. I wish I was never born.",t2_55ek82ts,2,0

I'm so stupid.,"It's been a long time since I've been depressed but I'm here again. This isn't like before. Before it was part of me, something I carried inside that just wouldn't go away. Slowly it did, slowly I got better. But now? This is the worst I've ever felt. Those days combined feel nothing like how I feel now. I know, it sounds cliche but it started with a girl. Doesn't it usually? But this is different. I've been broken up with. I've been cheated on. This is something new. This is every old wound ripped open, this is every new wound tearing away at me. I've never felt so used, so humiliated before in my life. I want to kill myself so I can escape the shame of what happened. So I don't feel so worthless, so stupid. So vulnerable. 

I visit my family's home country pretty often. I have close relatives and I always enjoyed spending the summers there seeing them. That's where I met her. We'll call her J. She was beautiful, she was crazy. She was extroverted and wild, she made me feel like everything I ever wanted to be. We fell in love. And it was so hard to say goodbye, to let go. But we stayed strong. We stayed committed. We stayed together for the next four years. There were ups and down's there some really great moments, things I'll never forget. Things that made me want to marry her. So I asked. She said yes. I started filing her paperwork that day. Lucky for us, her father who lived in the united states had already done so. For her, her mom, her brother. While we waited for an embassy appointment things got rough. She got distant, she cheated. But we worked it out. She convinced me it would never happen again, that she loved me and didn't want to lose me. That I was the best thing that ever happened to her. I believed her. So I forgave, and we waited. Things were good. Our relationship grew stronger. I loved her with all of my heart. Finally, we got the news, her family visa got approved for an embassy visit. Where she lives, she'd have to leave her country to go to a neighboring countries embassy. Her family isn't well off. So when she didn't have enough money, it wasn't a surprise. I paid for it. I paid for all of it. I paid for her mother, I paid for her brother, I paid for her. I paid for her tickets, I paid for the food she ate, I paid for the medical appointments. Everything. She was so happy when she got approved to come to the united states. God if I could share the look on her face with all of you. She was so happy. I was too. It was the best day of my life. Four years of waiting. Four years to start our lives together. She arrived, she was going to stay with her family for a little while. A little while turned a little longer. And now there is no life together. She say's ""Sorry, I never meant to lie to you. I just don't want to hurt you anymore. I don't feel the same way. I do love you, but I can't pretend I'm in love anymore, and me moving to be with you, isn't good for any of us. I don't want to be with you anymore."" But she did. She did when she was taking my money, she did when I was paying for every trip, she did when she needed my help. She told me so. She told me how much she loved me. Every day. Until the day she arrived. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best day of my life turned into my worst. And I've never felt so stupid before. I've never felt so used before. I've never felt so angry before. I broke my hand today. I left my job and told them I needed time off for myself. I bought a dangerous amount of alcohol and I'm on a race to see which bottle I can drain first. I hate her with all my heart, I hate her because she made me hate myself. She made me feel so alone, so humiliated. I'm ashamed. My whole family knew her. My friends knew her. What do I tell them?

Suicidal,Contemplating actually doing it. Ive been stuck in this dark hole for too long. I’ve dug too deep to get out.,t2_5vmyzn3w,1,0
I thought I was feeling better but I think I’m just feeling less.,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts before, but this feels so different.

Everyday I wake up and look at the sunlight filtering into my room from the outside. It’s nice. That’s my only constant. The rest of my day always feels like it’s up to the flip of a coin.

Some days I’ll feel good &amp; get right out of bed to try and reclaim my life. But i think those days aren’t coming around so often anymore.

Whats been scaring me is how I’ve been feeling lately. It feels like I’m going numb. It feels like I don’t care about anyone or anything anymore. My passions are now just past times. My friends and family feel further than ever. I’ve lost motivation to seek human connection. And I’m worried that this feeling will keep on intensifying to the point that I go back to being suicidal. 
—————
I think it’s getting worse and I’m scared bc I feel like I can’t stop it. I feel like I’m losing what’s made me who I am for so long. Instead of feeling like an individual I feel like a shadow. I feel like I’m slowly fading away while nobody notices and idk how to stop it without everything pushing me over the edge. I miss my art but everytime I try to go back to it I find myself in such a dark place. Is it wrong to find solace in something that destroys you? My thoughts have been so scrambled, I feel like my perception is blurred. I don’t know how to reach clarity but it’s what I seek.",t2_5vjsywwy,10,0

Depression is like going to prison for no reason.,"I'm laid in bed... I know it's going to be one of those nights where I dont get a wink of sleep and it hit me, I'm literally in fucking prison.

It feels like I'm in prison, and the worst part... I havent done anything wrong. I havent killed anybody, I havent raped or robbed anybody. I've literally gone to jail for fuck all.

I've been trying to be nice to her for an entire year , at some point i just stopped upon realisation of senselessness of the whole thing , only to be officially rejected  after a year of failed attempts. Later I've confessed my feeling , witch were fake , to other girls . I didn't want them to like me back , I did it because I wished I could feel emotions like back then . Of course , nothing worked .

Held Together...,"Got yelled at by my manager. No, this thing wasn't done wrong ""a half-dozen times."" We nailed it the third go-around because each problem had a unique set of circumstances.

It's not laziness; it's depression because everything here is so fucking expensive and *no one* can afford to live on their own. A second job at my current wage cannot afford anything more.

I can't talk to friends and acquaintances; it's always, ""I don't know how to help you..."" I don't want help; I just wanted someone to listen. Therapists are too fucking expensive in my area, even with shitty basic medical insurance (Fuck you, American health care).

Do i have depression? Need an outside opinion from someone not biased.,"So i saw a psychiatrist today for the first time after seeing a therapist on and off for about two years. Ive been extremely taken by what i was told today which was that my heavy mood swings and low mood (that i have had for about a year now- due to life events and i'm assuming a chemical imbalance because my fathers side has a history of severe depression) was because simply of my sleep schedule. When i go to sleep every night fluctuates and sometimes it can be as late as 11pm to 6am, i dont think i have insomnia as i am just usually watching stuff. I seriously thought i had depression or atleast some mental health issue as i know that many teenagers (including my friends) get sleep like mine but are just fine. I have struggled with a little bit of drug involvement (mdma) in the past few months which the psychiatrist also blamed on my low mood. I dont know i just feel like they are belittling my problems and my parents think i should go on medication but the psychiatrist just simply swept it to the side. And its not like im constantly severely depressed like i still have a job and school which i do go to but i will feel miserable at them, if i could rate my constant mood on a scale of happiness it would be like a 5/10 and i will get crazy mood swings (not just like normal teenager mood swings) like i will switch emotions from extremely agitated to depressed to like manic happy in seconds with no reason why. Could this be some type of bipolar or any other disorder? Is it just teenager hormones? Or do i have arising depression which will only get worse?

Any opinions or suggestions because this has kind of made me feel like my issues are all in my head and i have had problems with suicidal thoughts and self harm but im getting different opinions from everyone.

I now work overnight as a janitor at a corporate office making shit money and that's as far as I'll ever go. All night at work I just think about how I can off myself. It's crazy cause I'm the only one in my family who ended up like this. I was born in a middle class household with two brothers who are quite successful in their lives as well as two successful parents. I was kicked out at age 18 while my brothers got to live at home before college and after college. Even before I was arrested I was told by my parents I'm just a burden to them and my brothers. When I was released at 32, they cut all ties with me saying I was a huge disappointment to everyone out there. I was told  to go to therapy for a little bit but it didn't do shit. Whenever I think of killing myself it makes me happy. I hate when people tell me it gets better cause I'll tell you right now it doesn't. I fucked up in this life. Its sad cause alot of people who know my family have no idea I even exist. They never mention me for obvious reasons. I have no friends or a girlfriend so no one would check on me anyways.

"Having a Normal, Healthy Routine is Amazing. It's a Bitch and Half to Get Back into Though.","I cannot stress enough how content I was when I had ""normal"" routine. After every work day, I would go home, take care of the dogs, clean the kitchen, make dinner, and do other miscellaneous chores. And before work, I was even doing 30 minute workout sessions at the gym!  Then I'd have one fun thing planned for the weekend in addition to going grocery shopping. Life was amazing during this time period until something disrupted this routine. 

First, it started with the new year. I stopped going to the gym because it was getting crowded and I told myself that I'd go back once it died down. It's March and I still haven't returned. Then my husband got sick for a week and I had to stay home and nurse him back to health (A few unpaid days of work is cheaper than a night in the hospital). So there goes my after work routine!

Since these events, I haven't cooked a meal in God knows how long. There's dog fur and dust everywhere  and the dishes and laundry are backed up all to hell! My motivation is at an all time low. I'm angry at my husband for not picking up the slack. He's the neat freak after all but can't be bothered to fucking dust because his mommy did all the housework growing up. Though he'd never admit that he doesn't contribute. He blames ME for going out my way to enact a healthy, at home routine for chores and cooking, saying I didn't HAVE to do it. I could've WAITED for him to get home to help, you know?

Well, you know what? I've WAITED until you get home to help and you know what happens? ""Oh, work was a killer. Let's just order pizza."" Or ""Let's just be productive on the weekend and clean then."" Excuse me?! You can't try and make ME feel bad for illuminating the fact that YOU do next to nothing around the house. All I'm looking for a little GODDAMN appreciation and acknowledgement, you fucking asshole!

Anyway, this is a post about how routine really helped me combat my depression. I got a real sense of accomplishment with every completed task, no matter how small. It really sucks when you get knocked out of it for whatever reason (*cough cough* sick husbands). Hopefully, one day I'll be able to achieve a routine that focuses a little more on redistributing at home responsibilities in a more equal fashion this time. I think having some accountability in day to day routines could help me not fall so far behind in the future. I just need to sit my ass down with my amazing husband and create a routine TOGETHER this time. That way none us feel like we're underappreciated or not helping out enough. And if my dear, sweet husband finds that his work is too taxing and that he can't stick to a routine like this, then he better treat me like a goddamn queen for sticking to a routine that enhances BOTH of our lives!

P.S.

This post turned into a venting session. I'm sorry about that, but hopefully other people out there can relate to my feelings. I absolutely love my husband and he works his ASS off every day and struggles with anxiety. So I try to be as patient and as understanding as I can while trying to cope with depression.",t2_13loa7,1,0
Looking for resources that both help tackle self-hatred and improve myself,"Hi! I hope it's ok to dive in and ask for advice?

I'm looking for resources (books, videos, workbooks, recommendations for types of therapy etc.) that help address two things:

* A fairly strong sense of self-hatred
* Bad habits and other things I want to improve about myself

I realise that could sound contradictory (is the problem my opinion of myself, or are there actually issues with things about me?), but I believe they go together to an extent. But quite a lot of resources seem to tackle one or the other (or even at the expense of the other).

For example, I am seriously overweight due to comfort eating for years. This is a tangible problem I need to address. However, I also really hate how I look, my body etc. - which is counterproductive and draining.

From a bit of searching, it seems like CBT could be good for addressing bad habits, but I've had negative experiences with it in the past - it's left me feeling incredibly judged, and like a massive failure. So I'm wary of it - it's felt like I'm paying someone to help me beat myself up.

Any responses &amp; suggestions appreciated.",t2_d096r,1,0
How do you keep going? My partner and I both have severe depression and I'm drowning,"I have severe depression and anxiety, and every day is like walking through sludge. I've been medicated for this for about 7 years, I've been seeing a new therapist and she's great... But it's so hard to motivate myself. Today I managed to get up and have a shower.... only to get right back into bed and fall asleep until 2pm. I can't focus. I can't work. I'm so easily distracted. I've gone back to study, and I thought I was doing something I loved but now I just feel so apathetic and numb that I don't know how to conjure up any of the feelings I had when I applied for my programme. I honestly just want to sleep all the time. I don't know if it's a side effect of my medication (venlafaxine) or not, but I just feel so goddamn tired. 

To make things a bit more difficult, my partner is extremely depressed for a lot of valid reasons, but can't get help because of finances. We're also unsure if it's actually depression or something else, they don't want to go on GP recommended meds until they're evaluated by a psychiatrist, which is extremely expensive. They refuse my offer of help, because I earn less than them, but I have at least one parent who actually cares about me enough to be helping me out with my therapy costs on the months I can't afford them. I'm very lucky, I know, and I hate that my partners parents are actually wealthier than mine and yet don't give a shit about their kids mental health. 

My partner had a breakdown tonight, which has become a fairly regular thing. They keep saying they think about killing themselves every single day. That I'm the only thing keeping them alive. That there's nothing else to live for. I don't even know how to respond to this. Part of me just freezes every single time. I love my partner, I do, but I feel like this heavy weight of responsibility just falls onto my shoulders every single time they say this  and it feels suffocating. I know this is because of my own depression and my own issues, but it makes everything so gd hard. I don't know how to help, I don't know what to say or do or think. I'm struggling so much on my own, that I literally don't have the ability to pull someone else from that kind of darkness. I try my best, honestly I do. I try to push my shit to the side even for a moment, but I can never say anything right. I can never seem to pull them out of it. 

I'm scared to talk to people about it because everyone  says you can't be in a relationship with another depressed person, and I know that to an extent there is some truth in that... it definitely opens the gates for more toxicity, dependency, and fear. But at the same time, having someone who understands what you're going through, not freak out when you have your bad days, empathise when you're low and never judge you for how your feeling is the best thing. I'm not judging my partner for having these breakdowns, it's just that I'm so scared for them. I'm scared they'll never get help. I'm constantly worried and trying to figure out a way to get them to go to therapy. We've made a deal that if the suicidal thoughts get too much and too real that we will always always talk to each other and never do anything without that conversation. I know people get caught up in moments but I know they would honour that promise. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this here, I just feel so helpless. All the time. I don't know what to do. I just want both of us to be better. I'm scared that people will think I'm in a relationship that's doomed, I'm scared that I'm actually in a relationship that's doomed, I'm scared that I'm one of those people who is waiting for their partner to ""change"" - I never want to be this person, and in my mind I'm not waiting for them to change, I want them to get help and try to learn to cope with how shit the world is. 

Anyway. TLDR: I'm diagnosed and medicated for  depression, my partner's severely depressed but could potentially have something else going on up there, and I don't know how to keep afloat. I love them and want to make it work.",t2_5j4i1ii4,2,0

"Someone almost put me back together and left me, making me fall apart again.","I met a guy who was different. He called me out and thought I had depression. I was surprised cause no one else really cared or noticed. He had gone through depression as well, and had friends with it. He genuinely cared because he knew how painful it was. He comforted me, listened to my problems, and even complimented me. His compliments ended up being kind of flirting. He confessed he thought he liked me for 'one night'. I kind of realized I'd been falling for him. I confessed as well, but then he said he was confused. Either way, we still talked. Summer came around, and suddenly he was too busy to talk? When school started again, he started to take an interest in me again, but that was short lived. A month later, he told me he only wanted to be friends. I respected that. But suddenly, even our friendship was gone. And it hurt like hell because he was the only one who understood and cared enough. 
Sure, I had this other guy friend who was close to me, but he had never been through depression and didn't know it well so I was afraid of scaring him away. 

I tried to reconnect with the guy a few days ago. No luck. I cried twice that day. I often cried over him at random periods, wondering why I wasn't good enough for him. Why I was so boring that he just randomly left me.

I ended up talking to my other guy friend about this. I had told him I had depression, but never really opened up like this. So, I did. I even cried on voice call, something I've never done before. But I trusted him and knew he was one of my closest friends. He comforted me, even sent me a long text after we ended the call telling me how much he cared about me as a friend. 

(Back story from the guy friend: I had became friends with him before talking to the guy who made me sad. I had liked my guy friend first, but my feelings changed when I talked to this boy. I trusted my guy friend from the start though. He had always been the nice guy. He ended up getting a gf, who was one of my friends, during the time I started talking to the other guy)

So, I guess I learned something. I picked the wrong guy to open up to. As hard as it is to admit and accept it's true. If I had only talked to my first guy friend from the beginning, I'd have probably gotten the support I needed. Real comments about friendship and how much he cares, rather than a guy who did help me but ended up flirting and leaving me hanging. Someone with non confusing feelings rather than a guy who's a literal puzzle that I need to analyze and understand.

I don't know if I want to save the friendship, I know closure would prevent me from hurting more, but I guess I'm just a coward, idk. 

I'm still broken, trying to recover. But now I guess I have at least one really strong friendship to help me through the obstacles..",t2_5sf4o3co,2,0
Quebec French Makes Me Depressed,"Today, I want to share my thought in case it’ll help me feel better from depression.

I’m a guy from Thailand married to a husband from Quebec, Canada. We’re happy together, he’s the best thing in my life. We got married in 2017 and we had lived in Thailand a year before moving back to my husband’s hometown in 2018.

It’s been overwhelming for me since I landed in Montreal airport waiting for the connecting flight to Quebec city. Everything was in French and people spoke French. I was as ignorant as a guy from another side of the world who blindly assumed that Canada is a whole-English country that has French as a second language mainly exists in the Quebec side. I was panic when I saw my personal document in French. It’s so annoying having to ask my husband to translate them.

Next, I was living in Quebec city with my husband. I finally learnt that French is the only official language of Quebec province. Even though a lot of Quebecois can speak English, I was still struggling to enjoy living there as an English-only speaker. What did I do then? Learn French! I can’t find a good job, make friends or going out alone if I don’t speak French!

At first, I tried to learn French but I felt like it’s such a waste of my time to start from zero since I already speak English and we can move out of Quebec and live in an English province. Of all in Canada, I ended up in Quebec because my husband is a Quebecois and he didn’t think that I would be reacting this badly toward French in Quebec.

Moreover, there’s a lot of little detail that made me depressed and anxious such as I was being stared at anywhere I go because I was the only Asian guy among White people, I travelled abroad before which I didn’t care those staring because I wasn’t trying to live there; I have to shadow my husband around because I can’t speak French and the social manners, the culture, the humour, etc. are different from where I come from which overall making me nervous to communicate.

I’m happy to be with my husband though I’m so depressed. I used to be so active in Thailand, I had a job, family, good friends, and tasty foods. Since I arrived in Canada I’ve been unemployed, made no friends, mostly stayed at home, and the worst is gaining weight. Now we’re in Montreal. We moved here in search of diversity. I feel better because there’s more of my kind and people are more comfortable speaking English with me, but French is still the matter.

Our fund was running low and my husband went to get the financial aid from the government. He didn’t know that I would have to be included in the process. I was so furious to find out that I must choose to do something which is finding a job or going to school. Now I’m obligated to participate in the program if we want that financial aid. I’m devastated, I do not want to go out to do anything at all while I’m still in this French-speaking province. I want OUT! I want to move out of Quebec.

We can cancel that financial aid but I do not want to bother my husband’s parents even that they’re willing to help. They already helped us a lot. So now, I ended up having to go to school to learn freaking French! I feel like I’m being forced, I’m raped by this French province. I don’t want to find a job because I know I can’t go well without any French. As I said, I don’t want to start learning the language from zero.

I don’t want any solutions, the only option is moving out. I like Quebec, the cities and my husband’s parents, but I do not want to live here. Now I have to endure another year and a half going to French class because I’m obligated to do so to satisfy the financial aid program. I’m so depressed that I want to hurt myself multiple times a day especially when I’m home alone. I think of the way to die in my free time which I have all day. I’m still composed only because I love my husband and I know that he loves me. I also love myself (or used to?), but my mind and body don’t work well in this situation.

Writing this down and share to the public seems like something that I should do so I don’t feel like I’m carrying this alone. Sorry if this post is disturbing and thanks for reading.",t2_rz3ps,0,0
I think I'm depressed due to being so isolated/trapped. Any advice welcome.,"I work in a very small office on the outskirts of a city in the UK with one other person, who is great but is 66 years old (I'm 25) so we don't have much in common. Even the things we do talk about get repetitive and dry, as it would with most people. I love my job and am in a privileged position to be in it, so quitting isn't going to happen, nor do I think it would solve this.

I live with my girlfriend. We do argue a lot but its fine overall. She puts me under a lot of pressure though, and my friends are really evasive with me. They either don't arrange for me to see them or blank my attempts to arrange things myself.

Point is - I've never been this isolated. I used to feel that even if two of the three things I've mentioned (work, friends and relationship) were going badly for a period, at least you could count on the other one to escape them. But now it seems its all going wrong. I dont know what to do and really need help as this is completely new to me.

While everybody else seems to be enjoying their lives, I feel I'm wasting my twenties. I genuinely can't remember the last time I met somebody new or the last time anybody asked to spend time with me. It really is soul destroying. Please help.",t2_3yelviwx,3,0

"My boyfriends roommate walked in on my burning myself, advice ?","I used to have a problem with self harm, mainly cutting and I’ve been clean for months. Sometimes when my stress gets more than I can handle and I’m in a severe panic attack like today for instance I’ll lightly hold the lighter to my skin not long enough to do damage but long enough to ground myself. Well no one was home and right as I held the lighter to my skin his roommate and some friends walk through the door, we locked eyes I immediately dropped the lighter and ran into the bathroom.

Trying to survive but man oh man depression really fucks that up.,"Reality sucks! you don't know maybe most of you want be here next year maybe some of you will but honestly...I hate depression, I hate that there's nothing I can really do about it. I hate that I'm stuck in this shell just because I got the shitty end of the stick when it comes to genetics. I don't want to take drugs for this but I still want to live, even though I have no interests, talents, intelligence, looks and by evolutionary standards..I'm supposed to be dead anyways.

Wife feels I’m hiding my emotions,This isn’t anything new. People have always been surprised when I tell them I struggle every day. But recently my wife has gotten angry that I’m not expressing it but I don’t know how. My entire life I’ve had to repress it and just social stigma alone has trained me to put on a mask every day. I want to show her how I feel but I don’t know how. About a year ago I wrote down everything going on in my mind but it didn’t do much. It’s making me feel extremely guilty and worse.,t2_3j8t50pl,4,0
what am I doing with my life,"I'm young, I have my whole life ahead of me, but what is the point of going through the rest of life when I don't even want to follow what life has to offer. I don't want to go to college, I don't want to start relationships, I don't want to get up every morning and work from 9 to 5 until I retire. Why not cut all that middle filler in between life and death and just cut straight to the end. One of the main reasons why I haven't killed myself is because part of me is still scared at the thought of death. I don't want to live, but at the same time eternal nothingness terrifies me.

Lonely,Im just lonely. I don’t have friends. The last time I felt loved and not used by a girl was like 5 years ago. It just seems like I’m a sort of punching bag.

I had so much emotions and all wanted to come out at that moment. I cried for like an hour. I walked around the room heavy breathing and punching the wall. When I put the first foot in my room I saw my mirror. I felt so shit to see myself crying and screaming. So I punched the fucking mirror. Now I have a hurt hand and a broken mirror. My moms gonna be so pissed about this. Idk what’s gonna happen but I can’t explain myself to her. It just feels like no one wants to understand me or even tries. I feel like I’m worthless.

Do people pretend to be depressed to get out of a relationship?,"We were so in love and it was a beautiful, deep relationship. He left 6 month ago, saying he is in depression and he feels nothing for anyone anymore. He needs time to heel and focus on himself, but he is not willing to say farewell to me because he is not sure if he fell out of love or if it’s his depression that steals feelings from him. I always trusted him and I did not doubt his words first. I was kind, understanding and supportive, because depression is a horrible hell. So I gave him the space he wanted and waited.

We are long distance, so we did not see each other since that day. I called once in a while to check up on him, if he is doing better, if I can do anything. I heard the same story every time, that he is a bit better, but he still feels nothing for me and that he is very grateful for my support. I don not love you NOW are exact words. He was always replying my calls, talking politely but cold, said it is difficult for him to talk to me be because guilt overhelms him. I decided to give even more space and stopped calling, making sure that I leave channels open for him in case he wants to talk. We clearly agreed that when he undestands if his feelings are gone or back, he will call to say either to let me go for good or get back together. I started doubting about his depression, because he lives a normal life, changed the job to a better one, went for a week trip with new friends, does not have any truly dark thoughs taking over him. He is not laying in bed unable to do anything as people usually are in admitted depression, he is far from being suicidal. And I am very glad for that, I do not wish him to be in that dark state, but I can not stop doubting, if this depression is simply his way out from me. He is not taking any meds. I asked if depression was actually diagnosed by his therapist, he never replied to that.

In short, in all 6 months he never initiated the contact with me, he never asked how is my life, now we are on third month of no contact at all, he did not even text me on New Year, he ignored my last call. Nothing, no effort to maintain any contact with me, despite saying he is afraid to lose me and he dreams of me almost every night. Who messes with someone’s head like that?

So now, in this not-well-established-break up, I find myself so torn between being angry at myself one day and feeling stupid for allowing to treat me like this, for probably using depression to get out of relationship, as a total coward. And the other days I feel guilty for not being supportive enough, for not doing more to help him, although my strengths are evaporating. 

I know until I have hope I cannot get the closure that I think every person deserves. I feel used and tortured. I still do not see clearly if this is over or not. Maybe I underestimate depression or maybe I am the biggest fool. All these thoughts are driving me crazy every day and I am stuck. I do not know how and where to move forward from this. I need to pick a side and I am afraid to be mistaken in this choice. On the one hand, I cannot believe anyone is that cruel to not let go if the one does not love you anymore and sees your suffering. On the other hand, I cannot believe a person does not feel the love for half a year and considers it can just come back. It feels like the perverted torture from the person that means the most. I want this pain to end. And the worst part, that I do not know what I am more afraid of: to get that “It’s not you, it’s me” polite call one day, or to never receive any closure. Am I being so cynically ghosted? I can't even start recovering from break-up, because I have not received that break-up announcement yet.",t2_5w4zfcap,1,0
I don't know why I hate my birthday,"I don't know how long I've hated it for but I know I've definitely hated it since I considered attempting suicide a few years ago the night before my birthday

Thing is, at first, I make plans and have ideas and then it's like a switch

I feel physically ill over the idea of anyone mentioning my birthday, I feel so guilty people at work have got me presents... I kinda hope they're lying

I've asked my family for nothing, I don't really want to acknowledge the day.

As so many other people's birthdays are the same month, i focused on everyone else's, got a load of cake, organised a gathering, got them cards signed by everyone and buying presents 

Then people would joke ""hey it IS your birthday too ya know?""

I'd just laugh and say ""don't worry about it""

I have no idea why my birthday makes me so miserable and depressed,

I feel like I'm getting older and I'm a failure, I feel like I'm too old for a partner now and I'm dying alone

PPD sucks, being alone in everything sucks.

Wanted to give recovery a true chance.,"And they shut down the whole country. All mental health services are cancelled undefinitely, and my psychiatrist is locked up in the hospital with covid patients. My rxs expired today, but I was able to stockpile for at least this month of shut down.

Why not set things straight? Why not give professionals an honest chance? Be truthful for once and not in a defensive stance? With both them and myself. 

Its like the universe is telling me to go fuck myself. It doesn't matter what I want, things are never going to change. Idk what to do and for how much I can hold on without my therapist.

I can't see myself in the future but I know that if I get to that point I will be unhappy if I continue this hardworking life I have now. Why can't I want to be successful? Why does being a bum now make me happy when I used to feel so full of opportunity?

Everything I'm doing, I do it because I have to, not because it makes me happy. And the thing is, I have so much on my plate I can't be good at them either. I'm not a good girlfriend, a good worker, a good student. Even my professor today said to me, ""You need to grow up.

Feels really bad,"So i would say my story starts around a year ago. I was abusing alcohol and got into a DUI accident which also totaled the vehicle I was driving nothing covered. From this I attended DUI Drug and Alcohol classes. Got an interlock (non mandatory). I also recently settled in court for 3 years probation and a $2500 fine. I am a college student who makes $15 an hour working full time and attending college during the evenings. I have about $2000 in my bank account at this moment. I quit drinking alcohol and attempted to get out of the slump that I was in knowing i could do better. I got a new (to me) vehicle. Got my SR22 insurance and paid off $1000/2500. This past weekend after starting to feel that life was/ is getting better I was involved in another accident and by far my absolute biggest. I was merging onto the highway after it had just rained for the first time in a month and started to hydroplane. I attempted to correct it but spun out and ended up being hit by a semi. The vehicle i was driving is totaled. The semi was totaled and i am so thankful that neither my wife nor the other driver was hurt. However from this my insurance informed me today that i am liable because i hydroplaned onto the highway. I have 15,000 in personal injury coverage which may help if anyone decided if there was an injury after resulting from the crash. Currently my main focus now is the 10,000 in coverage that i have from property which defines the Semi-truck, the guardrail and the light pole. I believe this is way more than 10,000 in damage and i have no idea where to turn from here. Should i be hiring a lawyer? Should i file for bankruptcy?  Any advice would please help.

Insomnia,"I can't sleep tonight. Again. It's keeping me up, a mix of the soul-crushing anxiety I feel about both the immediate and existential, and the painful feeling of being sucked in through the void inside (the kind of feeling that makes you want to peel your skin off, in the hope that it will stop). 

I'm in physical pain, like always. I can't distract myself from the chronic joint pain that is sometimes in my knees, sometimes in my hips, but always all over. It's not as bad as it was a few days ago. That flare up was helped by sleeping for two days straight, so while I'm no longer dealing with as much physical pain, I'm dealing with the fall out of sloughing off my responsibilities in favor of a lazy solution to my problems. 

 I still can't sleep. The sun will rise soon, and tomorrow will be fucked, because getting no sleep at all is now somehow physically painful. I've been on pretty much every antidepressant, anti anxiety, holistic cure, but the problems with my body keep adding up and I'm struggling to treat everything that needs to be treated. The days where I struggled to find an ADHD medication seem laughably simple, because now my ADHD is at the very bottom of the list of things that need medical and pharmaceutical attention. 

It feels so hopeless. How can I keep a job and provide for myself like this? I've already failed at too many things to count, none of which was officially 'my fault', though I've been the common denominator in every situation. How can I not blame myself for failing, even if these failings stemmed from issues I have very little control over? I hardly can bring myself to try any more, because failing is so expensive, and so shameful. I look back on what has been invested in me and feel so wasteful.

I'll fucking do it soon I can feel it, that's the only thing that brings me some peace. Bye cunts",t2_55c41nj0,1,0
How do I go on?,"Hi,
I don’t really know where or how to start this. I’ve had anxiety and depression on and off since I was 18 (that’s 6 years for reference). But I managed to push through it, went through the motions of life, felt the emotions. It was do-able.
I met a guy 2 years ago, we started talking and then dating. He was my rock for a year and a half, he was always there for me, cheered me on when I was down, encouraged me to keep going and get help. We broke up this January, it was too much for him, me and my mental illness turned him into a different person. I took it really hard, I’ve been on the brink of suicide four times in the past two months. He’s saved me each and every time, screamed at me on the phone to go home, that he’d tell my mum what was going. He doesn’t know it but two of those four times I was in a park tying up the knot on my bought rope, ready to hang that sucker on the nearest sturdy looking thing and end it all.  He’s moved on now, he’s there for me, and he’ll always be an ear to listen. Life is looking up for him, he’s got a great job opportunity, he seems happy and joyful with life. I on the other hand had bad news after bad news. I found out I couldn’t have children, then I had a concussion, got let go from my job due to being mentally unstable and not someone they could rely on. I’m so close to pulling the plug. I’ve been seeing a therapist once a week for almost 9 weeks now, but it hasn’t helped in the slightest. In fact, she just makes me bring up these childhood situations and makes me despise my mum. Today, is his birthday, mine is in 6 days, I don’t want it. Last year he flew to me and surprised me, this year I’ll be alone and in tears. I’ve harmed myself multiple times, no one knows this. I’ve taken too many antidepressants many times hoping I wouldn’t wake up the next day. 
I can’t go on anymore, nothing is fair in life, and I didn’t expect it to be. But it was always do-able, now nothing has a meaning anymore, I’m just a walking talking vessel living every day.

Edit: tomorrow I’m finally going to end it, this evening I’m gonna watch a couple of my favourite shows, eat a hearty and good last meal. And tomorrow, just disappear and disconnect. I’ve had many attempts but tomorrow’s gonna be it. I didn’t mean for this to sound so melodramatic",t2_16meuz,1,0

Am I here?,"For the past couple of days, I’ve been having a weird feeling.  I’m going through the days on auto mode. I feel as if my body is doing whatever it does to get by.  I feel alive physically.  But mentally I killed myself already. To get away from my life.  I’m dead, but alive.  I’m dead mentally so why am I still alive physically? I’m dead, like I am dead.  Am I not dead. I’m actually dead and I’m just watching what my life would be like. Right?",t2_3i96tna6,1,0
What should I spend my free time doing? Nothing interests me,"I didn't realize it was ever a problem but literary all I ever did my entire life was school/video games/sleep and now all I do is work and sleep and all I know how to do is play video games. I don't understand anything outside of my room. I have no friends and I have no energy because of work. People say I look like an old man and I'm only 19. I feel like I'm losing my life and I just can't fix it. All I do is think meaningless thoughts constantly all day and the only break from that is sleep. But I can't get anything done and I'm so depressed I just feel totally hopeless. I feel so ugly because of the massive amount of criticism I've gotten about my appearance.

 It's impossible to feel good about yourself if you're completely alone in life and everyone says you look old and ugly. Someone compared me to an ugly puppet from a youtube video I'm too ashamed to say and I can't stop thinking about it, I didn't think I looked like that but now I'm heartbroken because how embarrassing is it to be compared to something like that? I don't ever want to be seen again by anyone who's ever mentioned stuff like that to me. I hate being alone but everyone I know makes me feel like I can't even been seen around them because of how much they judge me.

I feel like I can't not be lonely because everybody judges my appearance and I can't be around anyone who makes me feel so bad about myself. So then I'm left completely lonely and there's no way out of it. I just want to lay down in my bed and never wake up again.",t2_3x4px4zs,9,0

Does this ever gets better?,"I've been doing therapy for six months, twice a month, but I feel like nothing changed at all.

I don't have any energy anymore.,"I don't really care about advice or anything. Just venting.

There's just nothing left in me anymore. I feel like a shell of my former self. I'm trying so hard to get back into a better place and just nothing happens. I feel like an empty pit of dread. My friends and family have noticed I'm on a sharp decline and I can't really even talk to them about whats actually going on in my life.

My therapist was an asshole and gave shitty advice, so I haven't been back. I feel alone, and scared that I'm started to head back to where I was before I pulled myself out of this shit a couple years ago. Just...empty. I dissociate almost constantly now, not even thinking about anything. I used to describe my depression as a monster inside of me waiting to come out...but now I know the truth. It's the seeping sensation that literally nothing I do matters. That there's no way I can ever be truly happy, even though I have people that love me.


And that makes me feel even worse; guilty. I've started drinking way more than I used to (only had like one beer a week), and now I find myself chugging handles of Jack to which my friends have commented on. I've started smoking weed almost constantly. I've started self harming, and gained thirty pounds. I'm scared of what I'm capable of, honestly. The emptiness of depression is legitimately terrifying.",t2_524ii617,101,0
Waking up,"This has gotten so bad. Forcing myself to just wake up in the morning and go to school has become the hardest task of my life. 

Every time I wake up I’m just filled with this completely horrible dread and am faced with absolutely no will power to get up and do what I have to do.

The routine is getting to me too I guess. Wake up, get dressed, and go to the place that stresses me and drains me the most for 7+ hours. 


I literally burst into tears just because I have to get up and couldn’t take that awful feeling anymore. Almost like I’m either gonna puke or have a panic attack every single morning.


It’s so freaking pathetic and frustrating. 



Why can’t I just not want to get up because of grogginess like a normal person instead of the looming dark feeling I get when I think about my day ahead of me?",t2_5l5udy5f,2,0
Suffocating,"This is new for me. I don't talk about my issues with anyone I hate the thought of pushing my burdens on to others and I don't make posts like this because I'm always afraid of getting answers that I don't want to acknowledge.

 I'm 24 years old married to a wonderful woman who truly is the only reason I stick around in this world for.

I'm suffocating. Drowning within a constant numbness that's been growing within me for years. There is nothing that satisfies me. Job, family, friends, sex, games whatever it may be. I feel nothing towards anything. I feel as though I'm stuck in a void, this never ending blackness that consumes me and pulls me away from the things that should be important or held dearly by me. 

I never want to get out of bed and it's an effort every morning to move. I go through my days having conversations with myself as to how I feel. This voice within me constantly berating me telling myself I'm worthless and have no place in this life. 

I have no desires nor wants, dreams or ambitions at best I just exist like a mosquito sucking the blood from whatever gives me a short burst of any kind of feeling other than this constant blunt scraping in the back of my head. 

I wear a mask every day for my wife who has her own things to deal with in which I try so hard to help with. For my mother who I don't want to worry about me. For my sister who is growing into a young woman and needs all the support she can get right now. For the few friends I have who just wouldn't understand or who I'm afraid would exile me for being different. For myself because the person I am inside my head is vulgar, dusgusting bile with no consistency no purpose. 

I just am. 

I don't rightly know what I expect to gain from this post other than a feeble attempt to romove the thoughts within me elsewhere for a time so as to be free for only a short while. I can't cope with this in my head any longer its like lice in my hair itching, scratching, scraping it never ends. I just need it to end to stop I need to silence the silence. 

This was the best way I felt I could articulate what goes on inside my head and I've left plenty out as the post would probably never end.

Getting out of bed,"A few hours ago, I again got the intense urge to spend the day in bed. The thought that I may not have to interact with the outside world felt overwhelming and extremely appealing. The idea made me ""happy."" Or so I thought.

\-Weed

I smoke a lot of weed to medicate my deression and anxiety, which ultimately makes me more depressed and anxious, defeating the purpose of my prescribed antidepressants.

\-Cigarettes

I smoke around 10 cigarettes a day.

I keep missing meals and eating sub-par ones.

\-Routine

I used to meditate and felt more concious/present.

\-Routine

I get up and go to sleep very sporadically, don't always leave my room to go into uni.

I hate everyone who told me it will get better,"They have nothing smart to say. No ""i understand how you feel"" or ""i'm sorry"". Just complete invalidaton. ""it's not that bad"" ""it will get better eventually"". I've been hearing this for six years. For six years i've busted my ass of to fix my live only to meet failur after failure. And every year somebody told that it will get better. Nothing else. Just that it will get better eventually/soon/the next time. On the second year i stopped believing them. On the fourth year i told them this and asked them not to say it since it's just an empty platitude. They just accused me of whining, pessimism and ""with that attitude..."". Some ALL CAPS texts about how they had to wait patiently for a few months and they didn't complain. How children in Africa have it worse then me. How if i fail at all the important stuff i just to find a different reason to be happy. And my favourite, that i should just FUCKING FOCUS ON MY LIFE (also in ALL CAPS) . Because they never listened when i told them that i have no life. That MYABE. JUST MAYBE. IF I STOPPED FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF AT LEAST FOR A WHILE MY LIFE WOULD FIX ITSELF. All because i politely told them that i don't believe in their platitudes. That's when i learned to despise them. That they never cared about me or my problems. They never wanted to solve them. They just wanted to fix my mentality. To join their little Cult of Positivity. Forgive me Father for i have sinned. I lost hope when my life turned into shit. I complained. I felt sorry for myself. I'm sorry oh Father. Truth be told this helped me in a way because the bitternes and spite i feel towards them gave me some purposs in my life.

Low-key want to infect myself with Corona,"So, this may sound fucked up, but I mean what do you expect from someone who can &amp; may orchestrate their own death at any point?

Coronavirus has whipped up a bit of panic the last few weeks. To be honest I haven't paid much attention to the details of it. Aids turns to Ebola turns to Corona, all that shit, this is nothing new. Anyway, a lot of suburbs near me have started to come up in the news as 'danger-zones'. Kids in school getting sent home cause of it, local shopping centres being almost empty, everyone wearing masks etc.

For over a decade i've had this philosophy of, although I don't believe in God, for the sake of argument, if a god were to have quotas of, ""this many cancer cases per year, this many loving relationships, this many suicides"" etc, then I would relish the chance to be one of those that helped fill the quota of one of the ""bad things"". If me dying of cancer means that someone more grateful or deserving of their life doesn't have to, then I can delude myself into having some sick sense of martyrdom to ease the dying process.

Now that everyone around me is freaking out over the new trendy illness, i've been tempted and today almost acted upon putting myself into situations that increase my likelihood of getting infected. I don't even know the symptoms, I can tolerate physical pain to a decent extent and don't think whatever Corona has to offer will transcend what i've felt already. 

I'm not sure why i'm even posting this. I don't have a question or anything to accompany it. I guess if I had to have one, am I fucked up for seeing this new, apparently highly contagious disease as only a positive, potential avenue to off myself? The only deterrent stopping me is that fact that it's contagious, and wouldn't want to harm the little family I have.

I dunno, feel free to ignore me, I don't deserve any of the attention this post could garner. Just want to spew some nonsense somewhere other than my own head for once.",t2_116tue,8,0
"I found the best way to no longer feel depressed about the fact that I will always be depressed. Underestimating myself, and letting everything amaze me. Basically killing any tiny bit of ego I still have.","Hear me out. I've always been a boxing fan. For the longest time I pictured being the heavyweight champion. If it happened this year, and I defeated Tyson Fury, I'd grab the mic and say this: ""For 27 years, everyone I've ever met has doubted me. After tonight, there's not a person on the face of this planet who can ever doubt me again"". Then I drop the mic and walk out. Badass right?

Are you kidding me? That shit would never happen in a million years. I'm an uncoordinated dope with the reaction time of a dead person. That thought, finally killed my ego. And now I'm finally...happy about being depressed if that makes sense.

Over the past day or two I've started underestimating myself as much as possible, and I allow myself to be amazed by everything. The key is to not quit just because you underestimate yourself. I'll play Madden 20, and I'll think ""well I suck at passing so I don't think I'll complete this pass but I'll try. I just know it will fall incomplete"". When it falls incomplete, I don't feel bad because I knew it would happen. When I complete a pass it's like ""oh wow I didn't think I could do that"". Then if I'm playing someone online and they juke me out and spin and break tackles and score the old me would have been pissed. Dead ego me is like ""wow look how good he is.. I can't do any of that"". Boom, letting myself be amazed, and underestimating myself.

Same thing happens with girls. I used to be confident in myself but then feel shitty if a girl rejected me (which is silly because it happens to everyone at some point). Well now I just tell myself ""she's just going to say no, oh well"". Or if the girl gives me her number I think ""it's probably a fake number anyways"". That way if I get rejected or get a fake number, I expected it. If I get her real number, awesome, wasn't expecting that. You should probably not let her know you thought that way though. Have to be confident otherwise girls bounce fast as can be. I'd just rather not get my hopes up these days with my depression as bad as it is.

Then back to the being in awe part, I let myself become impressed by everything. My truck; ""Wow if someone didn't make this, I'd have to ride my bike or walk to work and that would take hours. It would suck if this was never invented"". Almost like appreciating everything to a ridiculous degree. ""Oh wow my favorite player is playing, I should watch this game, what if he died tomorrow? This would be his very last game"".

I also try and justify things I want to do. I still wanna lift and get big but my dead ego says ""I'll never get big"". So, I still lift, and I find reasons to do so even though I don't think I'll ever get any stronger or bigger. ""I like this Whey protein powder it tastes so good but I didn't earn it so I should lift so I earned it. I spent all this money on this weight bench and weights so I should at least use them. Someone else probably wishes they had this stuff"". 

I guess some of it you'll have to figure out yourself, in order to motivate you but this is what I do. I play dumb with myself. Pretending I'm awful at everything and being amazed by everything. Being humble is never bad though. You ever see someone who's actually really good at something, and doesn't even realize it? Like they're shocked when you tell them how good they are and it's as if they're blind to their own talents? Yeah there's nothing wrong with that.

So from now on everything amazes me and I don't think I'm good at anything but I still try because I don't know any better anymore. Or this is just a nonsensical rant and I'm creating a euphoric alternate reality because I'm so far gone mentally that it's the only thing keeping me from going insane.",t2_510io2c2,9,0
I needed to rant,"Hi, I'm 19F. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest in case maybe I could find some encouragement. I'm just struggling lately. Some background. I've struggled on and off with depression, anxiety etc most of my life. I've been medicated and hospitalized in the past. I've been to counseling on and off over the years. Started going again last month but honestly 50 minutes once a week isnt much. I want to get back on an antidepressant because my mood swings (not PMS related) are ridiculous. I cry almost every day about some stupid shit or another. I get so angry at myself for the mistakes I make, and the things I don't do. I just can't figure out how to love myself because I see myself as useless/lazy/stupid. I've had low self esteem for literally my whole life. It's such a bad habit I can't figure out how to break. The mistakes/ things I do just seem to reinforce my negative beliefs for me over and over. I'm always tired. I leave at 7:30am to drive me and my boyfriend to work. I don't get home til 6pm and when I do I feel like I no longer have energy for errands, cooking, or even seeing friends sometimes. I have what most would consider a good job, but I don't really care for it.

My life I had was really nice. I always was a little bit sad and depressed all the time, but I found a way to deal with it. And then it happened, I met the most beautiful girl in my life. I started to talk with her, and after a short while, we were together. I was so happy, I couldn't believe it. The relationship between us lasted for 3 months. These 3 months were the best I've ever had. Then it all started to break. It knew, that something is about to happen, but I didn't want to have that. I just wanted to love her so much. I wanted to much. Then it happened. She broke up and hurted me so much. Not because she broke up, because the things she said. She said that I wasn't ever depressed, that another guy is more important to her and that she changed too much because of me. This was the really first time I cried so much that I couldn't sleep. It hurt so much. I respected her decision, even tho it hurt. I just want that she is happy, and that no one hurt her. And now, in school, I hate my life. Everyone is staring at me like I am a monster, and her friends always come to me and start to bully me and make me down. And it's not like I don't have any friends, but something doesn't let me accept help from them. I just destroy more lives with that and I don't know what to do right now.

Could it be physical? Type 2,"I have had depression for over 20 years. This past bout is very different. I had a full medical in the fall and I am borderline type 2.

Fiancé is struggling right now and doesn’t seem like he wants to help himself. Kind of freaking right now,"Sorry if this ends up being a long post. 
A little background: we’ve been together for about 5 years, dating for two, engaged for the last 2 months, getting married in August. I have never been depressed and do not stuff or at all with having a more positive outlook on life (I am blessed and lucky) so it’s so hard to understand what he’s going through and how to help him deal with it. I’ve always known that he has struggled with what I would say is mild depression, and it was only last year where I really got him to accept and realize, in a long convo, that it was depression that he was feeling. He’s not very in touch with his feelings and I think has a skewed (narcissistic) view of himself. 

Ever since that conversation it seems like during his dark days he has all the regular symptoms and has no desire to do anything for himself and kind of trudges through life, which I get. But on his good days he has this sort of hope where he believes things are changing in him and then he won’t go get any help when he actually has the motivation to do it.

Previously I have been able to deal with this behavior pretty well since I consider myself pretty emotionally stable and strong. But recently I think the symptoms have worsened a lot, and fast. To the point where he has a pretty significant drinking problem and he doesn’t treat me very well (no abuse!) or just treats me with complete apathy. It sucks for me but I try to think of what it must be like for him. He struggles with insecurity and shame and let’s those feelings conquer any sort of lesson he could learn from them. Here’s my dilemma, I don’t know what approach I should have with him. It seems like anything I do is annoying to him whether it’s gentle or tough love. But which one should I do? Should I help him by cleaning his messes and letting him sleep and being gentle and just making myself available to him? Or should I encourage him to get up and clean and do work even when he doesn’t want to, and sort of pry in conversations with him to get him to share his feelings (good to note that he will never share anything on his own)? I’ve tried to help in many ways but it’s pretty obvious from his annoyance and defensiveness that he doesn’t want help. And if I know anything it’s that you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves. 

We’ve talked about him going to a therapist, and now that he has insurance I think he will go soon, but I feel like I need better tools to help him. Any suggestions are welcome.",t2_k4xkm30,1,0

Why am I alive?,"I have seen people, talented people, suffering from major illnesses. Some even dying. I have no special talents, very few friends, messed up relation with my family, academically poor, yet I still survive, and a burden for literally everyone. At least if I die I can help so many people by donating my organs. But yet I lack the courage to commit suicide. I believe in God, and always thought that if I survive the bad times, the future will be good. It's written, have faith, perform your duties, and carry on. But I think God doesn't even think about me, left me a long time ago to be by my own. With each passing day, I hope that the next day things will definitely change for good. But it doesn't. Trust me, hope is not a good thing, it's a poison. A slow poison that takes away everything from your life. 
I have tried talking to people, but they easily lose interest in me. Like sure they always tell me to stay connected, but after a substantial amount of time, they ignore me. I don't blame them, I am a boring guy; no talents, morose and depressed. 
Why is suicide so tough? Like it's hardwired in our mind that we have to survive. I can't kill myself, and living is becoming hard day by day. I have tried so many things, reading books, playing games, art, but nothing seems to be right. 
So my question is why am I alive? Why am I not dead? Why do so many worthless people like me have to survive here while the best ones are dying? It doesn't make sense. Anything doesn't make sense anymore.",t2_5211glud,5,0

Please tell me I’m not alone.,"Okay so these past two years have been the most difficult in my life mentally. I’m 26 years old, soon to be 27, and I feel incredibly sad, unmotivated, unimportant, and uninteresting. I pretty much just go through the motions each and everyday. I work as an engineer, have my own place, a wonderful bf, loving family, but I’m just so overwhelmed with life and I sometimes really can’t handle it. I am absolutely exhausted everyday no matter how much I sleep. I feel like crying all the time, no energy, I have no interests in anything anymore. I have “goals” that I want to achieve but I can’t seem to do/care about them. And I’m constantly comparing my life story/success with my boyfriends who is building his own YouTube channel and personal brand and is absolutely thriving. I’m jealous of his success, I’m jealous of others success, and I’m sick and tired of feeling this way every single day. It’s not right and it’s not okay. There are days where I come home from work and go to sleep at 7pm and won’t wake until the next morning. I don’t feel accomplished in my life, I feel like a second thought, and I feel like I bring absolutely no value to this world. Ive tried SO many ways to combat these feelings. I went to counseling, I’m on meds, I talk with my bf for support, I eat healthy, I exercise, I set goals and separate them into smaller more achievable goals, but the depression and the worthlessness wins EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. I want to feel important and proud of myself, but it’s almost impossible. The thought of having to live this way any longer and continue with this “adult life” is debilitating. How in the hell am I suppose to go on everyday like this? I’m already on anti depressants and they worked for a little bit, but idk it’s not working now it seems. Please tell me someone else feels like I do and I’m not crazy. Now days the only comfort I can find is in these subreddits to see that others are struggling as well and I’m not alone. I’ve even thought about how it would be so much easier if I just slept forever. I don’t want to die, but I also don’t want to live this life sometimes. Does that make any sense? I thought graduating college and getting older (almost 30!) would be the clear cut line to feeling like a confident and successful adult in every aspect of life.

"The antidote is life, not death.","Think about it, why do you suffer?   
I suffer because I am slow. I don’t move. I don’t eat. I don’t have a job. I don’t create. I don’t socialise. I deny all help. I am practically a living corpse. Being this close to death I can say that this is far from peaceful and to move further in this direction means to suffer even more.  
   
What does the depression want?   
Depression wants me to slow down more. Depression wants me to stop. To starve. To sleep. To destroy myself. To isolate. To reject life. To die. Depression lies and tells me that life is the source of my suffering even though my pain comes from the feeling of not living.  
  
What makes you better?   
I know what makes me better. It’s all the advice I have turned away from in favour of all the things that make me feel like shit. Exercise, healthy food, routine, a job, a creative hobby, sobriety, human interaction, therapy. All the things that make the depression scream in panic and claw at the back of my mind. All the things that keep me alive and sane.  
   
How do you kill the depression?   
I can’t, it is the unchanging infinite incarnate. But I can overpower it. I can outsmart it. I can starve it and weaken it the same way it starved and weakened me. No more sleeping in. No more junk food. No more drugs. No more mind numbing, unproductive pastimes. No more reasons to feel guilty. No more reasons to hate myself. No more reasons to die. I must come to terms with the fact that I am now allergic to these things.  
   
I am an addict who craves death. That is why I must live.",t2_5rnx0bm9,6,0

I googled inspirational stuff to motivate me, it say things would get better but its been more than a year and things seems bleaker than before, ive already ran out of options for money, i dont know where to turn to.

Collections agents hound me everyday, im so stressed right now that i think im being paranoid. I dont want to look at my phone because those agents kept calling.

Every morning i always wish i could still sleep, to wake up on my own time, not being forced to wake up, i keep saying ""i wish wouldnt wake up again, wish i could sleep forever""

Post Surgery depression spiral,"I had planned surgery one week ago, and everything went well. So far so good, just recovering physically as normal. Yet, the post-surgery depression is hitting me harder than it has before. I am on bed rest, and my mind is thinking backwards to easier times. While things right now are not bad at all (my only struggles are that I'm financially tighter than I have been in years &amp; I chose to move to a different country 5 years ago so I am far from family), I keep finding myself looking at a specific point in my life with rose-tinted glasses. I keep thinking about moving house back to my home country just to recapture that feeling of no financial stress. Yet, that really isn't a possibility for me, I own a house and I have settled here and have a better quality of life in most regards and am independent where I never was before. I just can't stop remembering what I think are better times even though I know they really weren't. I didn't even really have local friends back then - and I actually do now but sometimes I still feel extremely isolated.

Sometimes when I think back, it's like I'm remembering three different people's stories and not my own life. Does anyone experience this? I remember my childhood being one person, and then my early 20s is a totally different person's life... and now I'm a totally different third person. Sometimes if I think too hard, it's like I've got even more people's stories in there, even though this is all stuff I lived through and saw and experienced. I moved a lot of times in my life, to different places and now a different country, and it's almost sometimes surreal because I don't think that it happened. I just don't feel like.... this was my life. And I don't feel settled or comfortable in my own house, like I need to make a change and move somewhere else for some reason even though I fought very hard to buy this house and made it just right for me.

I feel like I'm going insane sometimes, because I want to uproot everything just because I am malcontent, and the past few days it has been in overdrive. I can't wait for this feeling to fade and to be on my feet again...",t2_3w05vvhd,2,0

Currently suffering through a bad bout of depression due to unemployment but have a lot of hope and am motivated. I’m seeking advice/learning how other people have dealt with this.,"Hi all,

I’m a 28 year old person living in Boston who has Aspergers and am MLIS (masters of library science degree)degree who has been unemployed for a month and a half and am having an existential crisis. Finished up grad school last August working as an archives assistant for a year and a half and then a temp at a large institution’s library for six months. I feel depressed for the following reasons.

1. Dearth of work in my field
2. Delusions that I’ll never have a quality full-time job
3.Feeling like I get so close in an interview but certain questions slip my fingers
4. Lack of confidence in my abilities due to paranoia and persecutory delusions about my condition and acute self-conscious about how others perceive me
5. Guilt that I perceive my situation at times to mostly be my fault
6. Ignorance complex that I’m not well read enough

These are the things I’m currently doing or did to mitigate my depression

1.run and strength train 3-4 times a week
2. Write fiction for 1-2.5 hours a day
3. Speak to my mom, brother and best friends throughout the week
4. Healthier diet
5. Gave a crap load of books to charity
6. See a therapist weekly
7. Take antidepressants mostly on time but everyday without fail
8. Loving kindness/compassion mediation to be more compassionate to myself and in a Nietzchean  fashion rid myself of societal guilt complex’s and affirm my own value/values
9. Finding ways to give away magic the gathering cards to schools/ Charlie’s and selling the significantly pricey ones
10. Read a lot of history, philosophy, and fiction to fuel my creative writing and to learn more about the world

I’m trying very hard but I feel an overwhelming sense of regret over my situation thinking that if I made better choices in the past I wouldn’t here. I also have a delusional complex that I’m a philistine who is not well read enough and will never catch up to my peers who are well versed in the western canon/multiple subject areas. On this ignorance complex I get freaked out with the enormity of the western canon and figuring out how I can possibly gain a masterly knowledge of it.

Well this was a long post but I want advice on how I can tweak things and learn about what it was like for you Redditors to go through some of this stuff. Thank you very much :)",t2_1ltkj7qf,1,0
Pretty sure my man broke up with me cause of my depression,"Not sure if this belongs here but uhh... Had some people commit suicide really good friends. and all I wanted was my man to hold me while I cry about my loss. He was “busy” and I could barely get a hold of him. Started thinking he didn’t care about me or even wanna hang with me. Got ignored. Depression got worse and would cry myself to sleep. One day his muscles were hurting and I went over to take care of him and was gonna stay the night. When his muscles had stopped aching. He wanted sex so I was like why not(stupid me) and then like 2 hours later he told me know cause he thought he was sick and I was like “that’s ok. I’d rather get sick and take care of you” and we had like a whole debate. I had to leave cause I was feeling stressed and I told him before I left. “ Come with me I don’t like being mad at you can we talk it out” hasn’t told him about the suicides. His sister was dying. Didn’t want to bother him with my stuff. He wouldn’t come with me. And I was just like wtf and texted him how I felt rudely. Oops. And he broke up with me. I asked I was like please let’s talk it out and he was like tomorrow so tomorrow rolls around and I don’t feel too hot. I go to the wellness center. I sit there for a few and notice dudes phone and was like oh fuck. And he comes out and sits down. I’m laying down on the little couch and I go “what’s wrong with you” he goes “I got the flu I’m going home” dude slept with me then 4 hours later broke up with me and then I find out I have the flu. Yuppieeeee. After we all back and everything I get like this wierd feeling and invite him over. I thought I was pregnant and we still never had that talk so I told him about the pregnancy. He calmed me down and just told me to at Some point get a test and we talking stuff out and I apologized because I had it in my head that I was at fault so I didn’t tell him bout the friends but told him about my depression and the other shit happening in my life and started to cry he pulled me off my bed and made me hug him cause I “needed a hug” and he was like  “I just need to be alone for a while. I promise it’s not you. I’m not mad at you” and yada yada. Now I’m pissed at him because from the long paragraph he sent it made it seem like he was breaking up with me cause of my depression and like who does that shit.

I'm having a hard time right now. I feel like I can't even find a thing to be upset at. It just hurts.,"So I'm 43 and I'm just recently coming to terms with the fact that my feelings aren't normal. I'm having a pretty hard time right now. I can see that in the past I've made excuses, denied, blamed other people or my situation. Recently I felt a dip and instead of starting a fight with my wife or saying something mean I just let it be. She asked what's wrong and I told her ""I'm just not doing well right now"". There was a big part of me that thought maybe being more direct would stop the slide. But it didn't. 

I don't have a therapist. I'm borderline ADD and I think the tremendous uncontrollable energy I had when I was younger staved off the lowest of the lows. At least it provided a distraction. But now it seems the highs are gone and the lows...I don't think they're lower. They're just always there. 

Anyways I really wanted to talk to you guys about my relationship. I've been married 15 years to a beautiful amazing woman, who doesn't deal well with this. She's very low maintenance. I think after a string of wild blow-out style relationships her calmness and ease really sold me. And it's been a good run. But she isn't a giver. Not really a taker, but if there's going to be energy in the relationship it comes from me. She's not active, not sexual, not funny, not motivated. She works hard, she's a great mom, we've had some awesome sex, and we are super affectionate...but it's like, she's available to share those things when I'm up for it. The energy is definitely generated by me. 

The only tool she has in her relationship toolbox is tolerance and space. So when I'm down she heads for the hills. She gives me ""space"" till I feel better. Her mom is a narcissist from hell who burns down everything around her at the drop of a hat, so I understand why she decided that is a good strategy. But it really makes me feel like I'm on my own. Or, it's my depression making me feel that way. I've told her before that giving me space when there's a problem just makes things worse. Oh, she also can not admit when she's wrong. Like ever. Zero. I'm fairly sure I've never heard a genuine apology. But she is trying. She asked me if I want to talk. And I realized I don't want to talk to her. I want her to be someone I want to talk with. I just don't think she is. And I can't figure out where to put that. I don't like my depression. So I don't think the ability to deal with my depression is a reasonable quality to request.

affecting work,"My depression and my anxiety have been causing my work to suffer. I have less energy and less motivation, I’m often tired and just wanting to go home, if I’m anxious I’m frantic and have a hard time doing anything.. then when I do poorly at work, I feel when worse about myself which makes me even more depressed, and I become more worried about getting in trouble with the bosses which makes my anxiety worse, which in turn makes my work performance even worse. The cycle won’t end. I’m so pathetic, my job isn’t even that hard yet I still fail. I can’t explain this to my bosses because they won’t understand. They’ll think I’m an idiot or just making up an excuse. One of my other coworkers said their mental illness was affecting their work and one of the bosses said it was just an excuse and they should just go to counseling if they’re really suffering. I don’t know what to do. I want to quit so bad but then of course I’ll have no money, and my resume is so bad I had a lot of trouble finding a job before this one. And if I can’t do this job, the easiest job there is, I can’t do another one. My anxiety also will not allow me to even just apply, let alone interview and start all over.

Faking headaches,"I haven't told anyone about this and I just want to get this off my chest and maybe even get someone's opinion about it.

I've had minor anxiety at the age of 10,which has gotten worse and started feeling down at the age of 12, which later became depression.

A bit after the age of 12 or 13 ( it's hard to remember things) I got a virus infection. It was nice to stay away from school and school wasn't great. I wasn't bullied or anything, but I didn't like school at all.

So after the virus was gone I started faking feeling sick so I could skip school more. I did it more and more to the point I almost stopped going to school and I think that continued for a year? I went to different hospitals to get help for my faked sickness, but of course that didn't help.

After that I started to fake a headache instead because I thought it would be easier to fake and I'm still doing it. At that point I've been regularly visiting the hospital and again, didn't help

Somewhere there I realized that I had problems with my emotions. Expressing them, talking about them, understanding them and so on. I think I was 15? I also realized that I might be depressed, but I didn't tell them or anyone for a few years about it. I didn't know how to, I was doubting myself alot and I did know if I even should tell anyone or if I'm just being over dramatic.

At 16 (?) I didn't go to school at all and I was very depressed. I had violent thoughts and cried myself to sleep at least 2 times a month. I started talking to a new friend about it and (half a year or a year) later told the doctors that I was probably depressed. I got to meet therapist but I never liked her. Infact she made me feel worse and I sometimes cried after the meetings. Half a year later (?) I got a new therapist and she was nicer, but not much help. I started self harming a bit before meeting her.

Now I'm 18, still self harming, still depressed, very anxious to do anything and getting worse. I've been going to a new hospital cause I'm an adult and the old one only takes care of children. All I'm doing if waiting to meet a specialist to possibly get some sort of mental disorder diagnosis (possibly aspergers?). Keep in mind, I'm still faking my headache.

I originally did it to skip school, but I think I later did it to bring attention to me because I wasn't and still isn't doing well mentally, at all.

Since this has been going on for so long, I don't know if I can tell anyone that I'm faking it and that the actual problem is my deteriorating mental health. I don't know what to do or what I'm even doing anymore.",t2_5nfeytu3,1,0

Abusive ex part 2,"I ended up permanently ending everything with him (yay) but then I met a dude and we dated then I was happy with myself and I wasn't interested in dating at the moment, at first I didn't like him but he kept bothering me so I gave him a chance, we talked on our views and he lied saying our views were alike when in reality it was nowhere near , I told him my past I told him how I was raped and I told him all the pain I endured , just for him to lie and waste my time , he was super obsessive , he tried to get me pregnant multiple times and even told me he wanted to get me pregnant so I had to stay with him , all that just to find out he had a kid with another women , and then he cheated on me with that same women and put me through all unnecessary pain , I gave him so many opportunities to leave me alone , And he never did , he claimed he wanted a life with me , I was very conflicted , this went on for months , I didn't need any of it , he actually ended up assaulting me (on New Years) he texted me on a spam account and  used one of his profile pics as one of my teddy bears from a picture that I had only ever posted on snap  that he was outside right ? So I went outside cause I was sketched out And when I went outside he was in a different car from the one he usually drives and I went inside , we talked and he tried kissing me so I slapped him Then we started hitting each other right ? Just fucking around cause I was like “dawg what” and then he grabbed my arms and crossed them I didn’t know his car was locked I didn’t know he locked his car but he did and he pushed me against his car door and kissed me I didn’t kiss back I just closed my eyes and pressed my lips together and after that I cried so I’ve just been having dreams about him and that situation , before that happened there were a lot of red flags he tried getting me pregnant on multiple occasions (even told me “I want to get you pregnant so you can stay with me forever”) Like I remember the last time we had sex I was off birth control cause we weren’t together and I thought it was over but he came over and I was drunk and like before we had sex I told him “Don’t cum inside I’m not on birth control and I don’t have plan b with me” cause it was super late right ? And he did it anyways and told me “I thought you said to cum inside” and then told me “You’re already pregnant, you’re pregnant it’s already working” also yeah no I’m not trying to have a kid I told him I wasn’t trying to have a kid or anything like that I want a career before I ever think about children and it just he gave me a lot of anxiety cause of the things he’d do , he’s once stayed outside of my house for like an hour and he didn’t tell me this at all like I didn’t know until days later , he lied a lot , cheated , was very manipulative , it just it wasn’t good he was obsessed , but this time I had the courage and repored him to the cops (with the support of teachers and friends) so I have a retraining order on him now , hopefully I can move passed this .",t2_2oogwu6z,3,0

Ignoring the guilt,"I'm supposed to be student teaching today. I only have a limited time to complete my total sum of hours, and while missing days can be risky, I have to consider my mental health. 

I've always struggled with putting myself first. I put others first, my education first, my love life first, my responsibilities first, but never myself. 
I know a lot of you can relate. People call people with depression selfish for feeling this way, self harming themselves, wanting to end their pain and take their life, but I see that we are some of the few selfless people around. 

If we were really selfish, we would let our depression win and let it take over us. We would allow ourselves to give in, to not try and fight, and to stop caring about everything. Instead, we are fighting depression. We are going to work and school. We are raising families. We are getting out of bed. We are staying alive. 

Depression is not selfishness. It is bravery. 

So many posts are rants, cries, pleas, and white flags involving the fights with depression. And everyday, we are still here. We are taking one day at a time. What others consider us being lazy for not going to school, or weird for not going to a social gathering, or selfish that we go to therapy, is actually moving mountains to us. 

I am proud of myself. I may screw myself with my hours, and I may need to make extra effort to make sure I finish. But I know it'll be worth it. 

My old therapist told me a saying once. 

Imagine the house you're living in. It has several rooms, and it can sometimes, those rooms can get messy. The bedroom, the closet, the bathroom, the kitchen, etc. They get messy, and that's okay. 

Instead of caving into the stress of the mess that is unraveling in your life, take one room at a time. You can take the biggest room first, like your bedroom, or you can start on the smallest room, like your closet. 

Your problems are messy rooms in your house. Yes, it can be overwhelming to deal with at once. It sometimes won't even be easy when taking one problem at a time. But you are taking the time to focus on yourself. 

To me, my bedroom is the most important room to me. Because of this, I relate that my depression and mental health is my bedroom. That is the first room that I always want to clean, that I want to fix. It can be hard to agree to that when there are other issues at hand that people expect you to tend to and ignore your mental health. 

I'm taking one day at a time. I'm having a lot of bad days, and I have a lot of messy rooms I have to tend to, but today I'm tending to my bedroom. To my mental health. And I'm not ashamed.",t2_46q81fpy,1,0

Getting Signed off work UK?,"Hey, so I'm thinking of going to the Doctor to see if I can get them to sign me off for a few weeks, just gonna tell you my situation and see if anyone thinks it's worth it. 

So I have had depression and anxiety  for as long as I could remember,  but 3 years ago I think I had a breakdown. My best friend convinced me to apply for a job at her workplace so I did, I got it and handed my notice in.  2 weeks before I was due to start my new job my best friend ended our friendship because I wouldn't go to her Dad's retirement party, she knew I didn't like parties or large groups I didn't know and she just said that me not going was the final straw. Anyway, I had to start the new job and work with her but she kept digging at me at work, undermining me and even put me forward to give a presentation knowing I had anxiety, then my trainer went on holiday and it was just me and my ex friend, I couldn't handle it so I called in sick. When I got back my boss told me I had passed my probation and the job was mine but he also mentioned my friend told him she though I was off work avoiding her not because I was sick. I broke down in tears (I'm a guy in my 30's so this was probably awkward for him) and told my boss I couldn't take the job, I explained what my friend had done and he offered to escalate to HR but I told him I thought that would just make it worse. In the end I worked my notice and left. 

I spent the next 6 months living off my savings and thinking about how bad a person I must have been for my best friend of 12+ years, who knew all of my anxieties, could just cut me off for something she should have understood.  Eventually, my Dad said he was being promoted and needed an assistant running his warehouse so I took it.  I now work for a builders merchants which only serves a maintenance company, we basically run the warehouse for them. It's only a small site but the company we work with is awful, the staff are too lazy to find somewhere to park and walk up the road so they park all over the loading bay. Literally, every time we get a delivery we have to unload it in the middle of the road that exits the estate and can get quite busy (we have a DPD depot here and they are constantly using it). My Dad just wants them all to like him so he just works around it but because I have been frustrated by it I have literally had their staff shout in my face ""Fuck off you cunt! It's our site"".  I have mentioned it all to our regional manager and he just shrugs it off.  Then there's my Dad's smoking, he has been a smoker since he was in his teens, I smoked until about 5 years ago when I gave up, but it was a struggle and maybe it's just me, but  I hate the smell of it now, it gives me a headache. My Dad thinks he has some god given right to smoke where and when he wants, he just lights up around me whether we are inside or out, he did it recently and I asked him to at least go to the warehouse door which was like 4 meters away and he laughed and just said no.  The staff all hate me for wanting to do my job safely and they all love to wind me up, my Dad does not even have the decency to smoke away from me and if I have time off for  holiday or something he always leaves loads of stuff for me to do when I get back because he didn't want to or couldn't be bothered. I just want some time to evaluate my life and my options. I am so miserable and I go to bed hoping I don't wake up so I won't have to go to work.

Is it worth me talking to the Doctor about it or will they just think I am over reacting? I have never seen a Doctor for anything like this before, I have no idea how it works.",t2_5ueg9min,1,0
Death from small airplane,"Reposting for day people. 
So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

It's almost impossible for me to make new friends and keeping the few friends I have is much more difficult, and feels more like a chore except no matter how many times I do it nothing gets done. 

I've been thinking that perhaps my depression is not a result of bullying, lack of deep social connections, or my hatred of myself. I've been thinking perhaps there is something else underneath, except I can't tell my parents because anxiety (and they never do anything about my health concerns) which only makes me more upset and frustrated.

When I was a kid, my birthday parties, going on vacation to the beach or to some relatives' house, studying, having friends, that was always about pleasing my relatives, make them proud. As far as my memory goes, I never enjoyed those things.

When I became a teenager I started feeling depressed. I spent years thinking about ""how did it come to this"" and ""what did I do"", but now I think that when I had more freedom and begun doing things I wanted, I always went into my room and did nothing. That was what I wanted the most: peace and isolation. 

It consumed me. It became worse and worse and I'm stuck in this cycle to this day. I don't know how can I ever get over it, except by completely changing how I am. Who I am is empty.

I know I’m not right but I don’t know how to go about it,"I’m turning 19 in a few weeks. I know I’m not right in the head mentally. I’ve self harmed in the past, my left arm is covered is long scars. I’ve never gone to seek professional help and I haven’t tried mostly because I know it’s expensive and I don’t have money, and I don’t want my parents or family to know about my mental state. I want to talk to my closest friends about why I feel shit so much of the time, like a burden and everything I’m upset about - but I feel like I can’t talk to any of them because it involves someone else who I can’t talk about with anyone. I am needy and the one person I want doesnt want me and I upset them because of my stupid tendencies that I don’t mean to cause harm with. It makes me so depressed and life feels so fucking impossible and I don’t feel I have the energy to make it. I feel so defeated and exhausted. I feel stupid writing this to strangers on the internet but I don’t know what else to do. Even just to type these thoughts somewhere.

Is it an eating disorder?,"I don’t eat much because of my depression. At the moment I haven’t eaten breakfast for two years, and go weeks at a time without lunch.

Depression took over my day in a way I have never experienced before.,"10/03 
Today is the strangest day of my life. 
I wake up at 10am. It is a Tuesday. I decide not to go to my volunteer shift, but instead have a lazy day. My left eye hurts. My house feels strangely dull. 

I am alone. 

I lie in bed for a bit, then get up to have breakfast with a pot of tea. This is proceeded by a couple of hours of mindless videos. Nothing out of the ordinary for my lazy days. Minutes meld together, my eyes glued to the screen. 

I can no longer ignore the dull pain in the corner of my eye. 

I shuffle to the bathroom and examine the crevices of my eyeball at an excruciatingly close distance. The world blurs around me as I see a black, string-like object sticking out from the corner of my eye. I take a hold of it and pull. And pull. And keep pulling. I hold a long hair in between my fingers, covered in a thick, slimy goop. I stare at it for what feels like minutes. It goes straight into the bin as I stumble back into the kitchen. The world doesn’t come back into complete focus after that moment. 

Time continues to blur in an unfamiliar way. A hazy lunch and another pot of tea ensue. My dad arrives home. I ask how his trip was as he walks through the kitchen. I listen but don’t hear the response through the monotonous sound of a since-forgotten Youtube video. I stare at the screen as my dad shuffles around the house, getting ready for work. 

Around 3pm, I text my boyfriend to say that I am going to have a shower. Instead, I lie down on my bed for a moment. My dad yells goodbye as he leaves for work. I think I mumble something back. 

10 minutes pass, and my mother arrives home. I check the time. 5pm. She asks me how my day was. It was fine. I somehow manage to ignore the dull, pulsating pain that had suddenly pierced my left cheekbone. I lie there for a few more minutes, groaning weakly at my mother’s suggestions to get up. She asks me if I have eaten dinner. 

“No.”

“Well you should eat some dinner.”

“Is it ready?”

“No, I still have to put vegetables in it.”

“How can I eat if it’s not ready?”

“There’s pasta on the stove.”

“I thought dinner wasn’t ready?”

“There’s pasta on the stove!” she exhales. 

It is now 6pm. 

I get up out of bed as if the past three hours simply never existed. I eat a small bowl of pasta that makes me feel strangely nauseous. I love pasta. 

I finally get into the shower, after what convincingly felt like a collective twenty minutes. I figure some cold water will shock me out of this stupor. I stand under the tap, feeling the cool water run over me for a couple of seconds, only to realise that I have turned the wrong tap, and that the water is actually scalding. I jump and almost slip, still feeling the world blur around me slightly. 

I slowly adjust the water, and finally have the cool shower I need. I feel my surroundings crisp slightly, as if introducing more pixels into my bathroom. I stare at a body in the mirror that looks vaguely like mine, but doesn’t feel that way. 

I barely have enough strength to lift the shampoo bottle from the floor. I feel that I am balding as I pull dead strands of hair from my head. It doesn’t panic me as it usually does. 

It reminds me of my eyeball in the mirror. I stare into that giant glass pane once again. My body feels strangely numb. I notice how cold the water feels now. 

The damp stench of a used towel overwhelms me as I take a heavy step on to the bath mat. It had never bothered me before. The mirror continues to me in a way that I cannot describe. 

I eat another bowl of pasta in my towel, this time ravenous for more. It feels as if I haven’t eaten all day. 

And now I am here. 

The more I think about the day and the more I write, the clearer my mind feels. I still can’t understand how the hours of today melded together, feeling simultaneously momentary, yet sluggish.

My cheekbone still hurts.

It’s hard to suck it up.,"I feel like I have to hide all my problems because my family thinks I’m doing good, and I don’t want them to know I’m still dealing with depression. I don’t really think they’d understand or believe me anyway. I don’t really want a counselor because I feel like they just say what you want to hear. I have no friends and am deathly afraid of social interaction, I feel others look on me with disgust and hatred.

It goes against everything that is taught when we're young (i.e. The Golden Rule). Being nice is all a facade, so why even do it in the first place? Is the only way to get ahead in life to be mean and inconsiderate?

Just need to get some things out my chest.,"I am a nihilist and atheist, for me there is no value and no reason to be alive other than to increase entropy, and although I have been suicidal at times I could never get myself to do it because I am terrified of death, the idea of dying scares me so much. Living without a propose and afraid of death it's hard it's depressing, so I try the hardest to keep myself distracted by not giving me time to think about this stuff I keep pushing it away from me, I try to runaway but it's like a shadow and sometimes it catches up and I get deep into depression. I regularly take Fluxetine and Sertraline.",t2_za9hq,4,0
Overthinking will be the death of me,"One main thing that I tend to do on a daily basis is overthink. I overthink every little detail of my life, from things that happen at work, little encounters with individuals that no one probably even remembers or thinks is a big deal, and I always make a big deal out of it. The thoughts continue 24/7 from when I wake up, to when I’m working, and right down to when I’m laying in bed trying to sleep. It keeps me up for hours and I’m always mentally drained. I even come up with  fake scenarios in my head that just end up making me hurt myself mentally as well. It’s an endless cycle of just pure stress and pain. I tried to look for a therapist but my first one was very biased and opinionated, and the second time I mustered up the courage to go to another the front desk people screwed up big time and made me not want to go anymore. I have no idea what else to do. Only journaling can go so far with my thoughts.",t2_2vhk7xg5,3,0

"Thought of killing myself today, couldnt do it.","I thought of killing myself again today, my parents are going through a rough patch, we all are. I confronted them today, it did not go as expected, the feelings just got worse, the thought of killing myself came after a long time again, i have no real friends to talk to this about so this was the best thing i could think of. I couldnt kill myself, not brave enough, i think. I am 23 now, no job, no friends, dropped out of school 5 years ago and dont know how to deal with this all. My father has been getting drunk a lot nowadays. My parents havent talked to each other for months even though we live in the same house. Yes i still live with them, have nowhere else to go. Dont have any skill or whatsoever or education to do any work. I wish i could escape this place, move far away and never look back. It feels like i m suffocating myself. I have asthma so it does literally feel like suffocation. I smoke cigarettes more now than ever before even though i shouldnt. I havent have a squeaky clean life though so i keep thinking all this might be a way of life getting back at me for all the bad things i did. I believe in God but i dont think he believes in me. Feeling shittier each day. I search for comfort with people who arent there and here i am trying to seek comfort with people i dont know, i feel kinda pathetic. Is this petty of me? I tried escaping this place, a different country maybe but i couldnt. I tried to study abroad a few months back but got rejected because i finished my hightschool 5 years ago and colleges dont take students with such a long student gap, so that didnt work out, tried applying for work but because of my low education, the only jobs i could find were physically stressful and because my health i cant even do that.  Life pretty much sucks. I always had hope though but today i dont think i can keep hoping any longer. I think God has abandoned me, just like how my family has been with each passing day.

I just want to be good at something.,"Ever since I can remember, I loved to draw. I wanted to be an artist.

It's like I couldn't take critic it was just that literally everyone around me was so much better. No matter what tips and tricks I used I was never good enough. Getting low grades on everything. So I dropped out. 

I then started working in retail for 3 years and my people skills sucked as well. Customers calling me difficult, awkward, rude, ect. Had more free time to play video games with friends and suck at video games too. So I quite recently to find myself and so far i'm not finding anything. I can't think of anything im good at.

"A small milestone, a small change of mindset.","I just realised this this morning, and it makes me super happy and I just wanted to share to mark it.

I used to workout for all the wrong reasons, like wanting to be skinny because then I thought people would find me attractive and I’d have loads of friends etc. Because I wanted to look a certain way. And all that and more was a real drain, and contributed a lot to my not-so-great mental health. I wouldn’t say I had a eating disorder or anything definitely not, but I was very insecure about food and exercise and it didn’t help with my mental health. 

But I started working out recently and i realised i dont think like that anymore. Honestly I just want to get fit for my body, because, you know, I live in it. I want to be strong and able to do things. 

I guess it seems kinda dumb maybe but man my view on body image has changed so much (for the better) and i didnt even realise til now. 

I dont know, I just feel like things might be getting better?

I’m terrified that it’s my responsibility to improve myself because I don’t think I’ll ever have the drive to do so,"Since I was in middle school I never cared for school because I hated myself and figured I’d kill myself soon, eventually dropped out in high school because what need do I have for an education if I’m going to end up dead. Since those thoughts I walked in on my moms dead body, my brother overdosed, and my grandma passed peacefully I guess, also me and my sister moved out away from our dad because of how careless and mean he can be. 

Now it’s just me and my sis versus the world because we don’t have any extended family, I still think about killing myself but I know I can’t because I’m the last support system my sister has in this world, I know I don’t have a chance but if I can do anything to give her a good life I want to. I work 45 hours a week so I can cover my part of the bills but I despise going to work and just participating with existence, I see everyone talking about their normal lives and I become jealous and spiteful

She’s extremely supportive and tries to pry into my emotions but I never tell her I want to kill my self, how I hide alcohol under my bed so I can get wasted every night, or my occasional self harm.

Stress management rant,"I finally went to the doctors and got perscribed citalopram. Been on it for about a month now and have no major side effects. I feel like its working in some ways but its just making me content. I still have no drive to really do anything. No drive to improve myself no drive to learn anything no drive to push myself.

I feel like there's this mental divide between my ""In the moment"" emotions which are now generally balanced and long term emotions when thinking of my future, aspirtations which are still down and unsatisifed.

I went to see a therapist and he said I was stressed which i could have told him myself. So now I've been suggested group therapy for stress management. From my understanding I'm going to be taught techniques for managing my stress. Things like keeping a todo list. Meditating. Deep breathing.

These are all things I've tried doing myself in the past but I've never been able to stick with them. I'm honestly frusterated right now. I'm going to go to show I want to improve but I really don't see it helping at all.

Like literally might have to bring my countless incomplete planners and forgotten todo lists as well as all the time management and goal apps on my phone. None of which has worked for longer than a week. You name it I've probably tried it. I could probably teach the class myself.",t2_5w8fe8aa,2,0
25 y/o male feeling old and depressed after leaving the army,"Hey ppl,

my english is not on point so it's a bit harder for me to explain the things sorry.

I keep thinking how now, years later, I am going to give birth to a little girl. A girl who will grow up and become a woman. I’m terrified that what happened to me will happen to her.

I have to put few things down, 

Few years ago, I fucked to up big time in every way possible, I'm talking health, work and family at the same time. 

It took me years to fix it. When I started landing on my feet, I managed to nail some things, took pride in my achievements, used to say : ""I don't deserve this, I earned it"". 

I was still miserable but my archivements inspired my close ones. This ok situation went for three years. It wasn't hell but it wasn't comfy either. 

Then last year came the hard times, I went full speed to try to overcome it, it was still alright for some time, like 3 months

Then when the hard times were over, I realized that I only managed to hurt myself and something in me broke. 

There is a me before and after that time. I've changed, I don't really recognize myself. People noticed. 

I've done close to nothing for months, can't think straight. 

I'm starting to think that my three years of ok time were just momentum I built on luck .

It’s not even a discussion and they stay ignorant not even attempting to see why it has to end a certain way for some people. Don’t Kill Yourself because you are a human who has made connections with other humans  and those people that were attached to you will be sad since you are no longer alive and you will be remembered as a person who gave up on life because you too weak.

"If this is still my life by the time I'm 31, I'm truly ready to die.","I'm about to have my 30th birthday and I'm not happy about it. In fact, I'm circling the very bottom of hell right now. I realize that I've wasted most of my entire twenties smoking marijuana constantly and abusing drugs instead of carving out a life for myself. Primarily because of suicide-inducing PTSD from a dark middle school experience that convinced me all pain is bad and all pleasure is good. This attitude has ruined my life for 17 years and isn't slowing down at all. I hate myself right now. I cannot enjoy anything anymore except sleep.

My family is very caring and so is my fiancee but the negative is also so much stronger and it's so hard to control it. 

I'm at an impasse in my life and though I'll never do it I always feel like ending it will finally give me that release that I want. To finally be free of everything in life.

But I know if I did that that it would destroy my mom, my sister and my fiancee. 

I just don't know what more to do. I'm scared, I'm tired, I always have to put on this face and happy go lucky attitude just so people don't worry but every day I only want to be left alone and just cry my eyes out and hope for death.

The immediate decision that life was fine.,"I had a friend recently pass away. And by recently I mean two days ago. How does one explain these feelings to anyone. I have to keep going on with my life knowing I’ll never see my best friend again. Not Knowing if it was intentional or accidental. Not being able to fly out to see his funeral. Every little thing that can remind me about him is around my house and even in my back yard. I remember everything, even though last week it wasn’t even something that crossed my mind. It now haunts me. It’s terrifying that someone can have such a strong effect on someone so little in their life. I will go on remembering that everyone I meet has a timer. And every person that even resembles him isn’t, cause that’s life playing the same game and I’m gonna have to take this as a lesson and love what I have in this moment. And not sacrifice a moment so small because they matter. All of it does.",t2_440ayv8b,3,0

Only like to be social when I'm drunk,"I am a female college student. I really look forward to social events with drinking involved because it feels like the only time I can be around new people without feeling awkward or like nobody likes me. At this point, I have to be super drunk to get to the point where I feel good about myself around other people. I feel pretty unhappy when I'm at a large social event and not drunk. Like if I have less than 5 drinks, I will definitely still feel self-conscious and scared to talk to people. Especially guys, but that's a whole different issue (I have a problem with placing my self-worth in what guys think of me). I know I don't have an alcohol problem; that's not what I'm worried about.

I just have such low self-esteem and anxiety about what people think about me. I wish there was a way to be the real me around people without getting drunk, especially because I can act a little too outgoing or embarrassing once I'm like 8 drinks deep. It just sucks and I don't know how to retrain myself to feel comfortable around people, probably because I'm always feeling like nobody likes me. I hate who I've become because I'm so awkward and quiet and never know what to say to people. I feel like the real me is in there somewhere but I just don't know how to get to her. I just kind of hate myself all the time. I have ridiculously low self-esteem. I get told I am attractive, but in a weird way that makes me feel worse, because it means there must be something seriously wrong with my personality. I feel as if people like me when they see my face but then when they talk to me for more than 5 minutes they're bound to hate me or think I'm a complete weirdo, if that makes any sense at all. I'm just extremely self-conscious about who I am as a person because it feels like I don't have whatever it is that makes other people like a person.

I'm just so bummed and blah feeling most of the time, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it. And I don't really want to talk to friends because it feels like I am burdening them, even if they seem like they want to listen. ",t2_4buyglh9,3,0

Today, a year or so later, my cousin accidentally broke the band. I dont know why but it feels like I have yet again been pushed into the well of loneliness.

I’m afraid if I open up once I’ll never be able to hold it together again.,"Sorry this is so deep and literally just all about my problems. But that’s what Reddit’s for I guess. Loneliness makes way for a lot of introspection.

My number one problem is that I never say what I want to say. I can’t express my feelings at all, ever. Even to myself, I rarely cry, and when I have, it has felt forced and meaningless, not relieving. I can’t fully open up to a single person in my life, so they all think I’m just level-headed (or cold to a degree). I’ve gone through two periods of depression and nobody in my life knows. I convinced myself that I’m all I need, and I do still believe that, that I don’t need the reassurance and advice from people who don’t know me as well as I know myself, but I see now that I’m self-sabotaging with my inability to let anyone in. I don’t know how to fix it and it’s driving me crazy.

So I’ve been trying to think about why I so adamantly refuse speak my feelings. And I think it’s because I’m scared, not of judgment or vulnerability, but of making my feelings real. The one person I let myself fall in love with... I told him I was in love with him and suddenly I was consumed in our feelings. Just telling him I loved him was all it took for me to find myself attached to him. He was so fucking good to me, but eventually he gave up on trying to get me to commit. And I don’t blame him.

It was when I lost him that I realized that this is exactly why I don’t open up. I’m terrified that I’m going to say one word and never be able to stop the flood of emotions that bursts out. Somehow, holding in all of my feelings one hundred percent of the time keeps them from being real. If I can just keep it all in, I can deal with it my own way without people pitying and tiptoeing around me. But simultaneously, keeping it all in sets a limit for how deeply I can connect with someone. And I’m learning this too late. Fuck.",t2_5qdftt01,3,0

My life is done,"I don't know how Reddit works but I'm just gonna vent on here. I'm 16 and I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts. I know how can a 16 year old be depressed he's just a kid. Anyway my life is basically over, and suicidal thoughts are taking over. I have been in online school for 3 and a half years and  Everyone of those years I was just barely passing by grade wise. I'm now in a charter school because I wasted 3/4 of my school year cause my laptop broke an the school wouldn't send another. I was hopeless but then my mom said I'll go to a charter school for the next 2 months so I can pass.  I felt as if my life was finally starting, but in the back of my mind I knew I had lost 3 years of making friends along with social skills. Well this school is terrible they just expected me to go in and know everything not to mention I don't have any knowledge of anything on my grade level. I also can't drop out and get a g.e.d cause I can't drop out in the first place. So now I'm laying on my floor thinking of the life I never had. How I'll never see my siblings grow up. And wondering if the other side is peaceful. And now I'm thinking how I need to wake up in 5 hours for school so I can continue pretending I'm ok.

Having a hard time with high school,"Hi all, I'm new to Reddit, so hopefully I'm doing this post right. 

I'm currently in one of the top high schools in my city and its extremely stressful. Everyone is constantly comparing test scores, and its hard to stand out. I've been raised to believe in an ""Ivy League or bust"" type mindset, and I'm just feeling very stressed out. I have a 4.0 GPA, but it gives me extreme anxiety just to be at school and keep up my grades. I have GAD (generalized anxiety) and some social anxiety, and to make it worse, I live in a dense city area which makes my anxiety spike. I'm very tired every day since I end up procrastinating. I don't want to do my work because it has just become tedious at this point, and just very boring. I feel like I have actually become more dumb by going to this school because I just end up learning things only to end up forgetting them. I used to love learning and reading books but now I barely have time to read anything, and even when I do have time I don't have the motivation to read anymore. I feel more grades driven than actually wanting to learn something new. I'm always incredibly discouraged when I see myself getting bad grades. Recently my grades have been on a downwards spiral and I'm getting very worried (recently I scored a 79 and 82). I've read articles that your immune system/brain growth is stunted from lack of sleep yet I can't bring myself to stop procrastinating since I'm just so stressed out and bored all the time. I feel like if I was at a ""regular"" high school I would have a lot more time to develop my interests. I feel like a mechanized robot most of the time, and always go through these depressive phases. My parents don't really acknowledge it, and didn't allow me to see a therapist until 2 years into high school. I've stopped with the therapist, because my mother has guilt tripped me about the cost of therapy, and because I get way too emotional when I talk to a therapist.

I'm very fed up with my school, and just upset with society in general. I think its very detrimental to put teenagers in such a harsh environment when their brains are still developing, and they are tying to figure out who they are. I see countless kids at my school taking stimulant/depressive drugs because they are so stressed out, and that causes permanent brain damage in some cases. I myself have horrible neurosis about everything, and push myself way past my limit all because of trying to prove to myself/parents that I can get into a great school. I would feel bad about myself if I stopped trying, but at the same time, I just want to stop everything. I really hate myself, and I just feel unconfident all the time because I'm in a family and school with amazingly brilliant, intelligent people. I just feel so inadequate and stupid all the time, and I feel like people are just judging me all the time. Every day I wake up, I'm basically just in denial about everything so I can keep going.

The worst person I ever met...,"I feel like a kid posting this, most of the post here are from people with real issues and I hope all of you get better, but this changed how I see the world, I always being a person that trust to much on others, I always felt that to get trust you have to give your trust, and by that way of living I got many friends and people that care for me, but even though people like me and most of them would kill for me, there is moments that you are all alone, I always bring a mediocre person, I'm average looks and average intelligence, people like my cause I'm kind and I always put others before myself, then I met this women, she was mysterious, very beautiful and clearly insane, she is bipolar, have drugs problems, cocaine, ectasy, weed and others, but she was also a very happy, kind, her smile always made my heart pump, one day she started flirting with me and I started flirting back, but in the end she refuse me cause we are colleagues, but I didn't  gave up I did a small party with weed and she was invited (please don't  judge my lifestyle) and I told my friend that I didn't had gave up,, but then I saw one of the most worst deeds i ever seen, my friend was trying really hard, and very obvious to see, she made him back away, but it damage a lot how I saw my friend, she apologizes to me cause I later looked really bad and told me that it would not happen between us .
I accept it, but one week later she invite me to a bar and I went and we both had a incredible night, and she told me that would be the last, but one week later I invited her again and she accepted, then refuse, and accept again, she had a very bad crisis with her family and I felt that she was so alone, I wanted to be there for her and I had promised her that smwe would just watch a movie, but we did more, she told me that I was amazing and that was one of the best nights of her life that with me she felt safe and could open to me, few days later we were always talking she was the best person in my life, I always felt like I am a loser that I am awkward ugly and dumb, but she would say that I am beautiful that  we went out a few times and then something happened (this is a very long story I very tired and broken right now but I wish to share everything that happened so people can have a clear vision of what is happening to my life, so I will rest today and post the rest later).",t2_5vngiv39,2,0

I haven’t been making any effort to go to classes, study or do my assignments. I’m definitely gonna fail this year.

The depression always seeps back. How do we even manage?,"Had an amazing last couple of days. Have more fun to come tomorrow. Yet, now that the day is over and I lay in bed, the depression has creeped back in. I know things will be good tomorrow, an hour or two after I wake. But the depression hits me hard as hell once I return to my room, all alone. I’m tired and I’ve had my fair share of socializing for the day. I wanted to go to sleep. But the feelings hit me so hard at night it seems. And this is something new. Also, in the mornings when I first wake up I feel overwhelming depression. 

It’s literally, I’m having an amazing day, then I go home, get dressed in my sleep clothes, and thoughts begin piling in my head, “why am I here?” “I’m better off dead” “I hate myself” “I’ll never accomplish anything” “I don’t want to be here” and so on. Even though I’ve accomplished so much and have so much to look forward to. There’s this doom that just appears. Then I wake up with the same thoughts and feelings of doom. 

It’s so fucking hard. I don’t understand why things have to be like this.

Depression re-emerging; what do I do?,"For a long time I’ve known I suffer with depression. As young as 9 I can remember breaking down crying in my mom’s car for reasons I couldn’t articulate to anyone. Through high school I struggled with thoughts of suicide and long periods where I couldn’t find happiness in anything. For the last 2 years, I thought I was better. I found motivation in life, made lots of friends, and had a much more optimistic attitude. Much of this (though not all) was due to the great relationships I formed in college. In the last 2 months I have lost many friends and depression has creeped its way back into the forefront of my life. I struggle to forgive myself for the smallest things and will have several hour periods where I can’t move from my couch. This affliction has only become more serious and crippling with time, although I have managed to keep my grades up and hide the fact from my family and most friends. Admittedly drugs and alcohol have played a greater role in holding this off than I’d like to admit.

I’ve considered therapy or talking to my family, but I’m ashamed. I know it’s nothing one should be ashamed of and I’d never judge someone else for their depression, but shame isn’t rational and it’s not something I can logically escape. Do you all think it’s possible to overcome this alone or with the help of a few friends or do I need professional help. I’ve never posted to a subreddit of this sort, but I’m feeling desperate and low and concerned for my long term future. I know I could survive months or even years this way, but not in a way that’s fulfilling. While this post is one asking for advice it really feels like a cry for help too.

Phsycotic Break advice needed,"I like to think I’m a sane and normal person, but my life this past year has been been going into a downward spiral. It started with pressure upon graduating college and not knowing what I wanted to pursue with my career. Then my gf of 3 years broke up with me, to which we’ve been off and on in a very emotional middle ground these past few months while she’s falling in love again, but with another guy. 

I don’t feel healthy anymore. In the good old days I used to spend doing the things I love like golf, skiing, drawing, working, being with friends or my ex. Now, literal hours I sit on my butt and play video games or wallow in what my life has become and why my mind races around in circles.  

I’m failing in almost every class at school except my senior capstone project, why can’t I just keep that together for 1 more semester? I need to be working on my employment opportunities and don’t even have a place to live once my current lease ends in 3 months. I’m broke and if I don’t work up the discipline to work again I can’t pay rent for next month. 

Right now I’m pulled off the side of the highway after experiencing a psychotic break about losing my sense of personality and identity. Part of me left with that girl, and part of me left with my failures of responsibilities. I’m too embarrassed to talk to family because they certainly don’t how to handle this in a loving way, and the only person Id 99% be comfortable of confessing this vulnerable position is my ex, to which I don’t want to show how poorly I truly am doing and receive care out of pity. 

I wish long walks in the park could fix this, or going back to things I love but that would only be a distraction. Any advice?",t2_13pii7ua,3,0

I want to believe in a after life so at least I can think of it as being more to life than this and then just dying and that’s it. But honestly I think that is it anymore. I believe that we die and just go into a state similar to sleep. We don’t see. We don’t feel. We don’t think. It’s just all nothing and darkness. It’s such a depressing thought but I have lost hope for anything else these days. What’s worse is even as bad as that may sound, I feel like it’s better than this.

Finding it Hard to Keep in Regular Contact with Friends,"So, a bit of context before I begin. I recently failed my examinations that would allow me to go through to University and since then my life has kinda ground to a halt. I would say that the reason for me dropping the ball like that has something to do with my mental health, but it would be wrong of me to blame it all on that.

A lot of my friends, some of my closest in fact have gone on to Uni and are now beginning a new chapter in life, and while I'm really happy for them, I'm struggling to maintain a relationship with them.

Their Uni is halfway across the country, and doing the whole long distance friendship thing has sort of become a challenge for me, which I hate because some of these guys are a reason why I'm still around today. 

For some reason I've already started to isolate myself away from friends who are still local, which makes me feel like a dick for just slowly losing contact with people I still want to hang around with, but I just can't?? I can't really explain why, I just rarely go out anymore, and people tend to drift away when you're not making as much of an effort, which I get.

A similar thing is happening with my Uni friends, but also the fact that they're doing something and I'm not is getting to me more than I would like to admit.

I hate being like this, and I don't want to lose the connections with people that have taken multiple years to cultivate. Am I just being an asshole?? What kind of things should I do to get my drive back, because sitting at home all the time is definitely driving me insane",t2_101btg,3,0
Are you depressed in your dreams?,"It's weird- I've been a recovering anorexic for 7 years, and I've had depression for 4 years. The two used to overlap a lot, but for a long time now they've been two separate problems. Anyway, when I dream, I am aware of my eating issues. Not every dream involves it, but often within the greater plot of my dream I'll be offered food at some point and turn it down. I also have lucid dreams where, once I realize I'm dreaming, I go on insane food binges. On the flip side, I have never had depression in my dreams. I've never had a dream where I have depression thoughts, and even in my lucid dreams, I focus so much on flying or jumping off buildings or eating that it never occurs to me that I have depression. Depression is completely absent from my dreams, it's just not even a factor. Does anyone know why this is, psychologically speaking?

Against time,"I constantly dream about going back in time to the age a was a little girl so I can start over and avoid my current state, cause I feel it's to like for me at 27 to improve things because I'm stuck. But recently I  realized that when I'm older (over 50), I probably will think ""what a wouldn't give to go back to when I was 27 and was still on time to fix things"". Maybe it's not a thing of going back, maybe there's still a chance to make it. But I really don't know how.

Sometimes I feel that if I don't move forward in life before the age of 30, it's over, that I'm nothing but a waste of air. But at the same time, I'm also exhausted after trying to fight depression all my life, to the pain I feel when I think it's finally over and then it comes back worst than ever. I'm scared, I've never had some many thoughts of dying before. 

I really want to get better, to finish my thesis and finally get a job. To feel useful and make my family proud. I'm afraid I'll turn into a toxic and resentful person if I don't get out of these hole, that I'm against time to make it or quit.",t2_54oxjlj,9,0

"I have very little savings but won’t starve. I have a home with AC, PC, and PS4 but everyday is so tiring.","I will be 27 in this November. Along with little loans and things I finally have some savings but I can’t even encourage myself to buy one motorcycle with loan. I don’t feel like I deserve it. I have a roof on me but everything seemed so miserable. 

This is a very long story. I feel like a child crying for attention. Ashamed at the same time. But it just feels like no one understands. I had to talk. In any ways. 

I’ve always wanted a gameboy as a child. But my mom told me we were too poor to afford any. So I just watch other kids play em in break time at school. I wanted to learn music instruments but no we were too poor. 

My mom had so much expectation on me. At around 7 my mom wanted me to learn ballet. But I insisted on Piano classes. Later she compromised with GuZheng (a Chinese instrument). It was Wednesday when the first class was held. I was so eager to go. I think the tutor there even provided one free class just to see if I like it or not. 
But I didn’t go. My parents got into a pretty serious fight because of that and no one could leave the house. They used to fight so bad. At an age of capable of remembering certain events like maybe 4, my mom drank farming pesticide in a rly ugly fight. I heard it just a couple of years ago that it was not the first time. 

It just never occurred to me so clearly that I shouldn’t asked for anything else but food, shelter and school. I just never understand. (Stupid brat.)

When I get into 2nd year of jr high I really wanted to learn guitar. And I asked the money for it. They said yes. Now thinking back I guess they just don’t have the energy to talk me out of it anymore. And my dad had to work his ass off to afford even bigger bills than before. At the time, my mom slowly becoming more and more distanced. She started to be hospitalized when I was 11/12. I never understand the real reason. I only knew she needed it. My dad told me she need a lot of rest. That’s why she’s in. 

My sister was not very happy with the guitar class cuz I got what she couldn’t have. But she didn’t stop it. We had pretty bad relationship because my mom was pretty bias with me and her. She hated me for a very long time. I hated her too for being mean to me. 
Later our family had to move because a neighbor is buying off our place or simply stealing our chance to rent there I forgot and my mom or my dad wasn’t too happy about it. We moved to a crappy hole. I had to share a room with my sister and it was not very good. She basically ignored my needs. I had to get up early in the morning to go to school and she’d usually stay up very late watching movies or talk to her friends pretty loud. Or leaving the lights on. It was so bad. We shared a room for couple of years. And later we grew better with each other. But we still fight pretty often. (I moved to another room my dad build for other family members after they moved away. )

Growing up I never understood why people doesn’t like me (mostly classmates). Later on I realized I was the biggest brat in the group. I even cuss so loud at one of my best friend in front of my home teacher when I was 11. 

Guitar lesson goes on and off because of school. In the mean time I saved up money from time to time to buy a few games to play at home. And I broke our PC pretty often. It was just a office work PC. Never meant for games. 

At 16, I can’t remember where I got the money but I think I saved it up. I struggled so hard with with one. Guns N Roses was touring in Asia and to our country. I cried at school when I was looking for tickets. There was a person who wanted to get rid of some tickets in section B for personal reason. It was so cheap I felt so lucky. I cried. But because I thought I can’t go. I cannot spend money like this. This is not worth it. But.... I still went there. And I told my family I went to play basketball with my classmates. (Now I think it’s funny that no one questioned. I never stay out and play basketball. My mom would’ve thought it was weird but she was in the hospital.) I was so happy. But alone at the same time. I didn’t have dinner, only had a chocolate bar on me. I felt dizzy when jumping in the crowd. After that, I rode almost 2 hours of train ride home. I almost missed the bus to my home in my town. 

Throughout high school, my mom has been in and out of the hospital. She’d stay for one day the most, and go back to the hospital. I knew she was sick but I never knew what kind of sickness. My dad’s explanation kind of made sense but didn’t really made sense. Later I understood she had depression. But I was too dumb to see what was causing it. One time I find a jar of badly contained sleeping pills she’s been collecting. I threw them away. Angrily told her she shouldn’t do anything. She should stay alive for her family, for me. I even begged her not to die in younger age. I can’t remember when. 

I don’t visit her very often. The visiting time was limited. It never occurred to me that I could’ve visited her myself and grab food for her. I. Was. So. Much. Of. A. Brat. 
...........one time, It was midterm. We have to clear out desks. In my school, we don’t have lockers or anything and most of us tug our textbooks under a space of our desks. So I had to carry all the books home. It was heavy. And teenagers get grumpy easily. No, I was just being selfish. My dad was so busy one day he asked me to go check up my mom and I refused. Cuz the books are heavy. 
And the hospital is just 30mins away from my home. I could’ve carry the books with me and go see her. 
It felt guilty. One time I illegally rode a scooter to see her. She was worried, said I was too bald (not in happy tone. minors can’t get drivers/riders license). 

I finally graduated from sr high. My mom kind of got out the the hospital now. This time she stayed at home longer than before. She asked me out couple of times but I was too lazy and wanted to sleep more. I stayed up late and sleep throughout the day. There was one time my dad was taking her to a long time family friend. Was gonna get some meds or some nutrition shots I forgot. She asked me to come along. I said no. She begged a little and looked concerned a bit. I said no. I stayed home with my PC. 

Two weeks into the summer. It was 12 oclock in the noon. I heard my dad shouting my moms name asking her why did she do it. I was so angry and storm out the door straight into the garage. 
She effing hanged herself in the garage. Located right beside the bedroom of my sister and I. I saw her lying on the ground as my dad already got her off from the beam on the ceiling. I could not believe it. We tried CPR but none of us were trained. It was like a really bad tragic comedy that everything gets cringy. She was so cold. I knew it when I see her face. She’s not coming back. But I told my sister that mom would come back. There was a coincidence that she “visited” me in my dream when it happened. I dreamed about we finally got a house and I was so happy. I told her we finally have our own house and can live together happily, never have to worry about this crappy hole and live a better life altogether. 

Couple of months later I got into a local collage. Normal things were normal. Only I still cry almost every night. And learned how to smoke (guess I needed to feel control over something).  I cut myself sometimes. I listen to stories from my dad how bad their relationship was. It was okay at the start. Later I realized he kept victimizing himself. Kept saying how much of a psycho my mom was. Everything was just toxic. Them tearing each other apart and killing each other without physical weapons.  

It was bad. That is true. But my dad plays some major parts too. Slowly some regular relatives stopped speaking to us. Cuz shit was just so bad. He blamed my mom’s death on one of my second aunt. The third aunt is basically another selfish and ungrateful brat. And the kids (cousins) never talked to us anymore after the funeral. They said would help if we needed anything but my dad had to held up a show and that’s it. Only some kids from first aunt would show slight friendliness only in biggest holiday of the year. 

Everything is so broken. I was in the hole for so many years. I feel like I had to listen to him or he’s gonna get sick too. Yet it’s so heavy at the same time. I am so tired. 

When I got home just earlier this evening, my dad told me he hit someone’s scooter in the back this morning. Paid a lot of money. I didn’t wanted to step into another hole again and basically said at least you’re safe. And I just couldn’t stop my mouth and had to tell him that he should call the cops next time (though I hope there isn’t another time). And he said “it wont help anyways”. He says that to a lot of things. He had to have a way of dealing with things himself. It has driven me crazy so many times. 

I don’t think I can take it anymore. But I can’t abandon him. And my sister basically can’t do shit. She’s 34. The three of us bought a car and a house altogether and it’s all under her name. She’s needy and emotional. Can’t be blamed or the whole family would be on fire. Can’t argue things with her if she think it’s right. Can’t disrespect her or she’d drive the car and run away. Don’t know if she’s gonna kill herself. I had a fight with her and she had to block me on Instagram and disconnect photos on apple clouds. (Shouldn’t even kept using her ID in the first place, should’ve been more independent on my part....) 

I can’t see points. I don’t know how to make this stop. 
I finally bought a PC of my own in 2016 and a PS4 last summer. I know money can’t buy happiness. I tried to love some people in my life but I always picked the wrong person and don’t love the ones who possibly really loves me. I have been abandoned by “friends” for being such a bad person. Now there are people who seemed to care about me but I don’t think it’s good to burden them for being friends with them. And every one has their own shit to deal with. I am so self absorbed. I am a bad listener. I am the worst person. I am like this since jr high. My family is a pile of sand no one cares about each other and I and the worst among them all cuz I complain about them I can’t get my shit together. But it feels like no one listens. I should help myself getting out of this I know how but why is it so painful. I’m so numb sometimes but I’m so sad. I need it to stop.

Die from the sky in small plane,"So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

I screwed up really bad with my social/career life and now do not see meaning in keep living,"A little bit of context (And just because I need to vent overall): I am a college student (Seventh semester out of 10). Up until last year, I was one of the best of the entire country and was a successful student. I was constantly stressed out, depressed and close to a total burnout, but my results were outstanding nonetheless.  
Until, last year, I tried to cheat some exams. I still do not know if I did this out of sheer lack of motivation or because I wanted to keep my image of a good student intact (Aka pure pride), but in my mind cheating was better than getting low grades. Anyway, it did not end up okay as one of my teachers found out and I confessed my crime. As a punishment, I was suspended for a whole academical term (Fall 2019).  


I got so anxious about everyone finding out about the cheating that I made a cover-up story about a travel I would go and because of that I would be away from college during a term. Long story short, everyone found out about that lie (I am not a good liar), and now my reputation is destroyed. Everyone thinks I am this liar/cheater, and when I went back to college earlier this month, people look past me and pretend I don't even exist. I feel SO alone and useless, and I cannot even feel bad about myself because that is all my fault: I am the bad guy, the villain, and I am suffering the consequences of my act.  


But the truth is I... do not like my past enough to have motivation to work on my future. I feel so hopeless about my future. I should gather motivation to revert this whole situation, but I still feel so... tired. TBH, I've thought about killing myself a lot in these past months, but the only thing keep me going is the small hope that I will graduate next year and then get a job overseas, only to never look at my past again and start fresh. But I fear I am not strong enough to go through these 2 years before graduation or even running from my past the rest of my life.

Hurt myself for the first time,I’m so sad I can’t do anything I can’t listen to what my teachers are saying it gets worse everyday today I cried at school but luckily no one saw me. I can’t do my schoolwork or study for two tests no matter how hard I try. I’m gonna fail them and then get sadder. I’ve never hurt myself more than a little punching until today I got a rubber band and stretched it as far as I could and slapped it against my wrist. It felt nice and next thing I knew I had giant welts all the way up to my elbow fuck. I don’t have any more drugs so I just hold my breath as long as I can trying to feel something. I can hardly even cry anymore I feel numb. what can I do please someone help me.,t2_3jdiyrb3,1,0
re living the most traumatic experience of my life,"i’m probably gonna sound so stupid and get made fun of to death for this but in 8th grade i went through the most traumatic breakup of my life. it was the relationship that permanently scarred me and warped my perception of love and dating forever. listening to the songs that i listened to while i was trying to cope is taking me all the way back to november 7th, 2018. it just really sucks that i had to be ruined right from the start. my love life hadn’t even began yet. i hate his guts now but a part of me is always going to still care, whether i like it or not.",t2_1zk0xy72,2,0
"Life has been real hard on me.. Please, I need someone to talk to.","I live in a Muslim family and I'm closeted gay and it's been like this for so many years. It's so hard to put a fake smile on, knowing that they love the person they think I am, and not my true self. Everything in my life is so shit. I'm so unhappy about everything, and my family doesn't support me in anything I do, and mentally abuse me whenever I want to do something against their wish. I've also been bullied throughout the years and nobody truly ever loved me in my life. Everyone left me or disappointed me somehow in the end. I haven't left the house in weeks and haven't seen any friends in forever, telling my family I'm going out to go to school but not actually doing it, just leaving the house and coming back a few hours later. I failed the first year in college because of reasons like this, but didnt even tell my family because of the way they would react, they would basically never look at me in the eye again. I feel like I'm too tired of life to go on, everything is killing me bit by bit and living with such huge secrets are starting to make me go insane. There's no one around me to talk, I've been holding all these in me for years now. I also never had suicidal thoughts before, but they started appearing lately.

Just wanted to know I'm not alone,"In the process of my depression, I'd ignored it for a while. I'd wanted to commit suicide since I was 12(I just turned 24) and I dealt with so much anxiety since then. I thought the thoughts were normal. I thought depression was just sadness. I drove myself to create a wall around that darkness to keep it out. But I couldn't. When I graduated, and my routine was about to change, I crumbled. But no one noticed. They thought I just wasn't ready for school.  I told a doctor, but I wasn't ready to accept depression. I went to a psychiatrist and therapist who messed me up more. I refused therapy when I went to a new facility, but my nurse clinician, she became worried. She wanted me to talk to someone. 

It took me breaking down and going to the psych ward in the hospital when I was 22 to see that I wasn't getting better. I got a therapist and honestly she's the best thing to ever happen. But the clinician I came to like, ended up leaving. 

I wasn't okay with male clinicians because my first psychiatrist and therapist were male and didn't help. I freaked out. I cried. Because that was all they had. Him and I we butt heads. I know what I don't want to do, he wants to make me take it because it worked for his other patients. I've been through 19 different medications from the span of 2018-1019. I only take duloxetine and valium now. But I'm not better by any means. I just know what to do. I got good at hiding it. But my therapist knows. I'm not okay.

The one question I wanted to know, was have any of you created an entity out of your depression/mental disorders(I do suffer from GAD, Social Anxiety, Major Depression with Psychosis, OCD and PTSD). I know he's not real. His name's Shadow. I saw a program that said depressives can create their own entities out of depression, but it's a ghost show. I'm not into those, but that part was true and I wanted to know if anyone else has?

Living is becoming a challenge,"Have you ever had that feeling where you’re not sad but you just feel empty. No happiness, no sadness or anger you just feel like you exist. Well I’ve been feeling like this for the past couple of weeks. I have mild depression yet it’s been progressing the past few months (yes I see a therapist and my lexipro was just doubled) and it’s just kind of left me empty. Like I’ll see my friends and I don’t really feel happy. Yes I know they care about me but it doesn’t feel like it deep down inside. I have also just been thinking why do I roll out of bed in the morning. For what reason do I struggle every day of my life. I have the most fucked up medical situation here’s the list: 
Depression
Hyper active immune system I.e I’m allergic to god damn nearly everything 
A rare genetic skin disorder called ichthyosis causes me to produce extra skin so i can’t really move without putting lotion all over my body in the mornings and nights
Food anxiety I get extremely anxious when trying new foods or going to a new restaurant (yes it’s a real thing and it stems from my allergies because I’d puke like every other day when I was little because of them)
Asthma I love working out bout the only thing that relieves my anxiety yet this constantly gets in the way

With all this in mind there’s really only one thing that’s keeping me going and it’s classical music. It’s the only reason I suffer so much. There’s an infinite amount of it to learn and i can always get better. No matter how weird people think I look sound or anything like that, if I can play music well the critics don’t care.

The scariest thing about depression is how much it changes you.,"Even just a minor spell, you don’t come out of it the same person. Never mind longer episodes. Eventually it just grinds you down into nothing I guess, but I’m only 21, guess we’ll see what happens.",t2_3k5ypiv9,5,0

Post Depressive Episode Highs,"TL;DR does anyone else experience moments of focus and clarity the days following a depressive episode?

I am going to bring this up with my therapist and doctor, but also wanted to ask the sub. Last week I experienced a minor depressive episode. Episodes happen about once a month. I was stuck in bed for two days and didn't eat. Towards the end of the second day, my friend dragged me out of bed and to a social event. I mostly just stood around and didn't talk to anyone. On my drive home I cried in frustration over being stuck in bed and how everyone else at the event was having fun and enjoying themselves. The next few days though I had a weird swing in emotions. I jumped out of bed early the next day and was doing chores and even exercised. I was laser focused at work.

Does anyone else experience these swings? It's like the clouds have opened up and I have clarity.",t2_k9gdn,10,0
"I am sick, sleep deprived, empty, and low","This is the worst time of year for me because it signifies the beginning of yet another summer, another year, in which I am a loser and my life is subpar. I am disappointed with my low quality of life, I am regretful of the choices I have made, and I am ashamed of the essence of my being.

I don't believe I will ever catch up to where I wanted to be, nor that I will ever recover from the fall I took following my endless blunders. I am one of the most stupid people I know. I look back in disgust at the decisions I made, the worhtless trivialities I prioritized, the lack of discipline I did not address.

I don't know what is left for me. I am unemployed, without an ideal family unit, without social support, without any fulfillment or even hobbies whatsoever. I see others live out my dreams and I think to myself ""I am not worthy of doing those things because I am too stupid and weak, and I have made a proper mess of things.""

"My friends have all moved on and I haven’t, and it’s killing me.","So I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. 

Basically I have always had friends that were 5 years or more older than I. About 4-5 years ago I moved into a house with two of my best friends. Like we were super close. Every night was filled with cooking dinner, enjoying drinks, weekends going out, etc. we were inseparable at that time. We did this for about 2.5 years. And it was arguably the best times of my life. Those guys will always be brothers to me. 

Well once our last lease was up, one guy informed me he was moving away to be with his new gf (whom I love) in a city four hours away, and the other guy was getting his own place by himself for himself and his future wife. I didn’t think anything of it, I went ahead and bought my own house and all was good. Once in my new house my mom suddenly died at 53, then three months later my step dad and then a year after that my dog of 10 years died. (Maybe this is important idk)

So here I am, two years from when we all moved out. Finding all my friends have moved on. And I have no friends interested in dinner parties or going out. I have friends but then I find myself being super clingy, basically asking them to do something everyday. Which just annoys them to no end and they eventually just don’t want to hang out. 

I find it so incredibly difficult to cope with this loneliness, I know it’s nothing compared to some people, but being social was such a big part of my life, and now I feel like I just have nothing. Just this empty house and me sitting on the couch literally staring out my living room window as Netflix softly plays in the background. Just wondering what I’m doing with my life or whatever. 

I guess this is maybe a rant. But if someone else feels somewhat similar please chime in. I really don’t know what to do.",t2_5uj7b8um,3,0

I can't help my cartoonish friend,"I have a friend who's attached themself to me. This has basically happened all my life. I attract younger brothers and I don't know why. 

We met online and are on opposite sides of the country (US.) He's a total teddy bear of a guy. He loves cute things and generally acting cute. He likes to roleplay and is often flirty. We bonded over our similar taste in men (we're both dudes, but I'm bi and he's mostly gay.) After I made it clear I'm not interested in dating him, he's mostly been talking about other guys he's got the hots for, which I'm comfortable with. He still flirts, but it's died down to ""have I mentioned I'm gay today"" kinda stuff, not the serious flirting we started out with. We have no mutual friends or even acquaintances, and I don't think he has that many people there for him in his life. I honestly do like him most of the time, and my life would be much lonelier without him. 

He's clearly suffering from depression. Sometimes, he flips like a switch into absolute nihilism. He honestly sounds like lyrics from a metal album sometimes. He's clearly calling for help and clearly thinks I can give that. 

But the thing is, I can't. 

I've tried listening and being supportive, but it always grows into apocalyptic kind of stuff and how he wants the whole world to be destroyed or politicians to all die or something. It's always vague stuff, no concrete threats. I think it's just finding solace in being an edgelord. 

But it's really disturbing to me. He's normally a teddy bear. It's really toxic. I'm afraid it will turn into actual threats if he doesn't get help and I don't know how to defuse it. Anytime I try to push back on these malevolent rants, I become the enemy and it turns into a huge fight. 

And I know it sounds super cartoonish, but it's really painful for me. 

I've set boundaries-- no sociopathic talk about killing the world or the streets running with blood. But he ignores that. 

I've tried telling him he needs to seek professional help, but if he's in a rant, psychologists just become another antichrist. He was a open to the idea for the first couple months, but ever since, he's just gotten more and more anti-psych ever since talking to *one* volunteer on the first website he found. 

Just now, he turned from happy and enjoying working on something to completely deflated with no obvious trigger. And I'm just staring at this wall of chats coming in a message every few minutes basically saying ""help me."" 

And I'm *not* helping him. I'm not even talking to him. I don't know how to help him. I can't patiently listen--it turns violent. I can't set boundaries--he ignores them. I can't send him to informal or formal help, because I have nobody to send him to/no one he trusts. And I really don't want to block him. 

He just spirals through it for a while and eventually snaps out of it. But what if he doesn't? I feel like there's nothing I can do for him, but if I do nothing...

I feel responsible for his well being, which I know is wrong. I feel like if I block him, I've failed him and myself. 

Please advise.",t2_bp7l94d,1,0

I don’t even know what’s “normal” for me anymore.,"I was texting a friend of mine who I’ve had problems with before. She said “You’ve been acting so weird and different lately.” She has probably said that at least 15 times since I’ve known her. (I’ve known her since late 2018)
But she has NEVER given me a reason as to why I’m acting so “weird” and “different”. So I asked, “What am I doing? How can I make it to be better for you? What is normal me like?” She replies with, “I don’t even know what’s “normal” for you anymore.” I’m constantly trying to change myself for her because I want her to be happy. I’ve been told dozens of times to just walk away, ignore it, and don’t change for other people be yourself.

I have trouble looking at people when talking to them i guess i just stare at them or i feel like they are judging me or judge me. I have so many bad memories of so many people that i just hate most of them. I am sad most of the time and i don't look like it but my laughter doesn't look natural. I just don't feel anything maybe that is an unhealthy coping mechanism. I also ruminate a lot, i really can't remember when i was happy last time. My father is like always ashamed of me but i don't care about that but he is an abusive father. If he wants to get something done he will threathen to kill himself and beat himself... My mother doesn't understand me at all. I guess maybe she is also not mentally stable. Everyone who is friends with me, thinks i am a very stupid loser guy( i am good at studies though). I live at a hostel and a person just became my friend so he could be at studies but i guess everyone makes friends out of mutual interest(maybe). I look sad all the time so people always thought like i was crying or i was just gullible. My face looks like someone who is definitely not happy with his life. People always dismiss it as a personality quirk. Also i get irritated and angry very quickly. I was bullied and i never stood up for myself. Because i was slapped by sister i front of my class when i was in 7 grade because a ""friend"" said that i was disturbing him which was completely false and i was just crushed. He was just torturing me because i didn't gave him video games and movies because my computer was damaged but he wouldn't believe it. Also i was beaten by a 17/18 old when i was in 8rd grade. I was teased my whole life by everyone(even my own family). I felt miserable everywhere. Because of this i have anxiety of everything that is social. I feel very awkward, at one time i even felt like i couldn't order my food. Because i have picked up some weird quirks like raising my eyebrows all the time, talking strangely, walking while dragging my feet, i felt like my mouth wouldn't move while talking. I was insulted constantly. I have tried to change myself by becoming more acccepting of myself, having a good diet, exercise more but my brain still wasn't working that good. I realised that i took much more time than my peers to understand stuff. I was planning to giving more time to doing stuff that i am good at. Becoming more better at what i could do. But my parents didn't support me and i felt totally crushed. I guess i didn't plan it though. My good grades weren't able to pursuade them. I should have put a much better performance to convince them, try to put that thought in their head from a long time etc. But whenever i tried to talk to them they said to talk after the exams. I relapsed to my old hateful, digusting habits. I feel like i just can't do it alone but in my society there is so stigma on mental health that if i seek help people will think that i am insane. And i did seek help, the doctor said i needed therapy and some medications. But everyone in my family was like no he was born gullible, stupid, sad and he is just making this stuff. So i didn't took treatment. Also i am mostly uncertain and i isolated myself many times. I was and am a vulnerable idiot who is trapped in a shitty place and can't get out.",t2_5q8c56f3,1,0

What do you do when your depression starts to show in a relationship?,"I'm in a relationship and I can feel what is happening as it has happened many times in the past. I feel like a lie. My depression controls my life but if I keep people at a distance, I can feign normality. I can hide away the days I just lie for 16 hours not eating not sleeping but paralysed by indifference and apathy.

But I can also be fine on some days. I can be charming, passionate, full of care and love. But it's a deception. I am not this lovely person who has occasional depressed days. I am the depression who can sometimes manage to be the most caring ball of sunshine. The two live side by side - the emptiness that looms fuels the longing for something real. It makes me care deeply about others whilst I am unable to care for myself.

So, I meet someone and they see those sparse moments of passion. They see the slight rays of sunshine amongst a cloud of darkness. But all they see of me is the sunshine, so they perceive me as that sunshine. Then, as it gets deeper, the facade drops and I can't feign normality. The reality of what I am and who I am comes through. But they don't see that. As the commitments grow deeper and the time we spent together grows, they start to see the clouds and they don't realise they were always there. They think the clouds have just appeared and it means I don't care about them. They don't understand why I've suddenly become like this. I can't explain myself anymore, I don't want to go through that same conversation where I explain my depression and it feels like it will never make me good enough. But then, I'm left just saying ""I don't know why I wasn't available, I don't know why bla bla, I can't explain why I didn't respond then"" when I just want them to leave me alone because I will never be enough. I didn't stop caring, I haven't stopped feeling. I just got too close and they realised how empty I was.

What do you do when you get to that point? I don't want my depression to be someone else's burden to bear.",t2_17cq8u,2,0
Depressive episode bc of school,I have been so stressed out lately.. my best friend left me for someone who hates me and it messed me up so much. I'm in a group with them for a school project since 5 weeks. We should've presented it last week but I just called in sick.. I still dont have all of my work done and because of that the one person screamed at me. I know it's my own fault but all this stress is too much and when I think of school I'm getting so sick and I wanna throw up. I'm still not going to school and my mother doesn't know. I haven't showered for a week and my room is messier than normally. I feel so dumb and pathetic. I feel like everyone is leaving me. I only have one friend left but she is going to another school.. wow. My problems aren't big at all. I'm just a sensitive crybaby. I'm sorry if you've read it this far.,t2_5sdy1zyq,1,0
I feel like a lost cause mentally,"To be honest, I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe it could be a good way of recognising my own issues. I’m male (20) and am struggling with depression and my adaption into adulthood. I’ve always been a shy quiet guy, but after I’ve left high school this seems to have gotten way worse. In my job, I’m surrounded by people twice my age, which I don’t actually mind. It doesn’t have the pressure to fit in, as I’m already the youngest there by a mile. I struggle with speaking to people my own age, especially girls. 

I did have a few struggles with drugs such as coke and weed, but I thought if I kicked these my mood would improve. Things have been slightly better since I stopped these, but I wouldn’t say my mood has significantly improved.

Since I’ve started to take notice of my depression, I have noticed some side effects that I’d rather live without, these include:

• Regularly forgetting words whilst speaking to people. I’ll be telling a story and suddenly I’ll forget a word that is pivotal to the story I am telling. This is so annoying as it makes me appear like an idiot with no vocabulary.

• Nervousness. This has been particularly bad recently. I’m not talking the type of nervousness you’d get before sky diving. I get nervous if I’m walking into a shop or cafe I haven’t been in before. I get nervous whilst speaking on the phone to people at my work, to the point where I don’t answer sometimes and rely on email.

• I’ve become a people pleaser in the worst sense. It’s not even that I particularly want to make everyone happy, I just say what people want to hear sometimes to make my day easier and avoid difficult conversations.

•This is something recent, but a few people have picked up on it. I struggle with eye contact, I finds it awkward and I’m not sure why. One of my friends compared it to speaking with a blind person before. (This wasn’t to be mean btw)

•I become infatuated with any woman my age who shows me the smallest bit attention (came to realise this once I heard Jim Carrey say it in a film). I’ve never been able to form a relationship with someone before, and I feel the longer it takes, the worse this is going to get.

• I feel uncomfortable being in a crowd of people. Like if I’m at a social gathering, if I’m in a conversation with a big group of people I feel pressured to contribute which makes me feel nervous and run off.

These are just a few of the things I have noticed. I’m thinking of seeing a therapist, but I live in Scotland and to be honest I don’t know if therapy isn’t just for rich people in Hollywood. I do have friends, but I only have one true friend I speak to everyday. The rest are people I went to school with and I don’t feel I particularly fit in with them anymore. Not saying they are bad people, but I can feel me drifting away from them. I have thought about suicide, but I wouldn’t want to put that emotional strain on my family. I wouldn’t say I want kill myself. But if I learned by some magic that I was going to die next week, I wouldn’t put up much of a fuss.

Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far. I just thought I would write some of this down to see if I could recognise some of my own problems on my own. It has been quite therapeutic actually. If anyone else is struggling with any of this, I’m happy to chat.",t2_5vs98rdk,3,0

Then I got hit with med school rejection. Business started to struggle and I had to consider selling an asset as well as apply go medschool a second time. eventually had to sell off an asset to save the business. Got rejected again. My MCAT expires and I’m turning 32. 

I don’t have it in me to try again. I hate working 9-5 jobs that are all bullshit. I wanted my own medical practice to provide care to my community. Now they’re telling me to go become a PA, or a Nurse, or go international.

I have just realized this, after observing that every time new thought forms in my mind, it is a negative thought. Negative past experience, negative fake scenarios, self doubt thoughts.

The idea of ending things is all that makes me feel okay anymore(TW),"My meds stopped working. I’m always sad. Or numb. All I’ve managed to do is fuck my life up beyond belief in the last year and now I have nothing and nobody. I have no friends. The family that was still talking to me basically made it clear they only did so because of my last suicide attempt. I fucked up every romantic situation to come in my life and hurt the one person I actually care about. All I do is fuck up and hurt people. 
Lately, most of my thoughts have been about hurting myself. I started self harming again and I’ve been thinking about taking harder drugs again, too. My life and everything in it feels empty and I can’t be bothered to care about myself anymore. 

When I think about ending it I just feel really calm. Like if I did it, everything would finally be over. I wouldn’t have to live through it anymore. I used to have a hard time with it. When I first started thinking about suicide(about 7 years ago at around age 12), there was a sense of distress that accompanied it. It would happen during panic attacks or really bad nights. I’d think about all the people I needed to say goodbye to and that would stop me. Now, when I think about going back to the same bridge from last time and being done with it, I feel relieved. I realized I cause more problems than I ever mean to, and if I weren’t around, that would stop. 

I think I’m going to do it soon. I need this to be over.

10 years later,"After 10 years of feeling like something isnt right, I finally was diagnosed with depression and anxiety today.

I was on the fence because at first the symptoms were only felt every few days a month. I remember being 14 and accepting the fact that I was going to kill myself, but I was just waiting for the right moment. Yet throughout the years I still pushed it away as me only having the occasional bad day or feeling hormonal cuz of puberty. Since I could still get out of bed in the morning to do stuff and I wasnt self-harming (in the traditional way people tend to think of), I figured I was just being dramatic or looking for attention. 

Fast forward to today, and Im at the point where waking up everyday is just exhausting. Having to do this daily; putting on a smiling face when deep down I feel like a shell of a person. Struggling to pay attention in a 1 hour lecture. Sitting down to do homework and ending up not doing anything. Falling behind with no motivation to do better, and every day asking myself ""why am I even still here? Whats the point?""

So I got a little bit of an interesting story to tell you all so I went and I started talking to my ex again and she is probably my first love I guess you can say so we started talking and she was going through a little bit of financial trouble now me and this girl we dated for like almost a year back in 2016 and for the last four years I’ve been so heartbroken so depressed and every relationship I’ve been in hasn’t felt the same it’s been so hard and I don’t really have a lot of people to talk to you I have some friends here and there but I guess you can say they don’t really understand It hurts you know it really hurts but like I was saying a she was in a little bit of financial trouble recently so long story short she said that if she didn’t pay her child support she would go To jail so me being the good person that I am and me having a big heart I recently got a good job so I had money you know to give her I gave her 300 then you know Valentine’s Day comes around and I get her a really expensive thing from Edible arrangements and you know I’m trying to think that maybe me and her can work things out and be together again little did I know she was talking to another guy I know she’s with another guy essentially I know I was stupid for believing in her and for thinking that things would be different I mean after all she lives in Pennsylvania I live in New York but I thought maybe we could make it work again because of last time so now when I see that she has a boyfriend I go in I ask for the money back that I had center because it was more than just 300 and got a double arrangements thing I pretend probably all together I’ve probably sent them somewhere close to maybe over $1000 and I could’ve use that money to go towards my savings account I could’ve use that money to work towards my own house or towards my car something that I could’ve done to build myself up but instead I chose to help her because she has no one now it hurts just because that when I ask her back for the money she blocked me on everything and now I don’t know where else to turn and I don’t know what else to do other than feel like shit I feel like a loser I know probably most of you were thinking wow you’re stupid you’re an idiot why would you send any girl money that doesn’t even live in the same state as you You’re stupid like how could you believe her how could you trust her if you don’t know what she’s doing every day all day and I know and I’ve got those things for myself as well but I feel like when you love someone when you truly love someone you take their word for certain things and you just get blinded and you know some of my friends told me not to send her money to stop and I kept doing it thinking that maybe she would say that I am changed and I’m doing good so maybe she might want to be with me of course it didn’t work out like that and now I feel more depressed than I already have felt and I’m just close to the point where I don’t even wanna wake up anymore just take a bottle of pills and I’m out you know",t2_3f4f4rj2,1,0

First Time Liking a Girl in a Year goes to Shit,"Since my last girlfriend broke up with me a year ago, I haven't had an actual crush or anything, but a month or so ago I started feeling real things for a girl in my band.

I just want to be loved and I just want someone to be there for me,"Lately it seems like everything in my life is just continuing to go to shit. I am 22 years old, still single and it’s starting to get to the point where it is really getting to me. I’ve never had a girlfriend or anyone for that matter who has even remotely cared about me, for the most part I just feel invisible to the human race. I keep trying to improve myself, I’m trying to get into the habit of exercising more and grooming myself by shaving my shitty facial hair but nothing I do seems to work. It just makes me think that I’ll never be good enough for anyone no matter how hard I try. 

I’ve managed dates before but every time girls would just look at their phones, not really pay any attention to me and basically give me fuck off signals. I keep thinking to myself what is wrong with me, am I ugly? Am I too boring? Am I too overweight etc. I’m now starting to engage in extremely self destructive behaviour, I’ve recently broken two months sobriety by drinking two whole bottles of whiskey straight and then having a nervous breakdown, I’m self harming regularly and I’ve started binge eating again to the point where the weight I’ve lost is started to creep back.

All I really want is to be loved, I just want someone in my life to help me and to reassure me that everything is going to be alright in the end but it looks extremely unlikely. I think that’s my biggest fear, being alone. I feel like every day I’m starting to lose my mind because of it and I worry every day now that I’m going to die alone. I think to myself that I’m an unloveable piece of shit who has no redeeming qualities about themselves whatsoever.

TLDR: I’m starting to get sick and tired of the loneliness I’ve been experiencing lately and I feel as though nobody loves me and nobody ever will.

Hey everyone, I’ve been super depressed off late and I haven’t really talked to anyone about it. I’m not suicidal or anything but I constantly wait for death to arrive. Not a single day goes by that I don’t think about dying but I’m too scared to follow through with it.

School won’t cure your depression.,"I have been struggling in silence for a while now and just recently made the conscious decision to do something about it. I’m 22 years old and about to graduate Uni. I think it took me a while to come into terms with my depression because I always relied on my crutch to get me through it: school. I used school to get good grades and in return felt validated by the school, peers, and parents. I don’t consider myself a smart person, but have always been driven to get the best grades I could get so that I could feel that sense of validation. Fast forward to today, I am graduating within the next 2 months and my depression and anxiety have worsened.

How I'm feeling.,"So alot of times I feel good. I don't really sleep well but I never did, and I am really really skinny. I don't really eat all that much. It's never really bothered me. I'm graduating soon and I'm moving out of my fraternity house. Hopefully I'll start eating and sleeping better. Be a healthy productive member of society.

But sometimes, something happens and I just spiral into thoughts of oh I'm not good enough or smart enough blah blah.

Alot of times it's girl related, I've never been in a relationship and I'm 22, being in college and in a frat and seeing everyone else doing that really sucks.

Sometimes it's school related, unused to want to get my masters in accounting and I changed my mind for alot of reasons, mostly I don't want to be a CPA, and I'm doing a bachelor's degree and getting regular job.

There's other stuff too, maybe it's being skinny, maybe it's me feeling like my friends don't like me even though they do, maybe it's x maybe it's y. But it's always a spiral and idk how to stop it.

And like I said, most of the time I feel good. This weekend was pretty bad but tommorow feels like it'll be a good day unless something bad happens.

Idk what I really expected to get out of this post. And I really think it'll be better come may when I have that change of pace and scenery. It just feels like forever away. And I feel like I should be enjoying my last semester not struggling to make it through.",t2_hvp9d,1,0

Die drowning in the beach,"I listen to tango. This specific tango always comforts me, it has something warm about it. I have rarely felt comfortable. Life has been more discomfort. Perhaps that is why Argentina enchanted me and enchants me today. Tango brings me comfort, it brings me heat: why wouldn't Argentina (or Uruguay) have the same effect?

I'm still lonely. I continue a thousand things. But now I'm a freshman of Portuguese Literature at the glorious Federal University of Santa Catarina. I care about rankings so I went to see where the little princess of Trindade was and we are (we are? I'm hardly a freshman) the twenty-second in Latin America. I remained sad. Perhaps rankings are not that important.

I thought maybe I was going to be hospitalized last week. Fortunately, I wasn't. Because I tried to kill myself recently, they infer that soon I will have to try again. The psychiatrist did not want to leave the medication with me. I said that I wasn't crazy about trying something new with medication. I have the recipes.

I don't even know more than to complain. Yes, I am lonely. I've always been lonely. I didn't have most of the experiences of an ordinary teenager. I have a few friends. I never went to their homes. Maybe I don't have friends. My family is dysfunctional and I learned what suicide means from an early age. I talked to my mom last week and I almost had an anxiety attack.

I tried to contact almost everyone. It was not a success. I felt even more lonely.

Things should have improved. I moved to another city. I recited my poems at a bar. I'm almost a college student now. But now I can only remember that once an Australian Prime Minister went to dive into the sea and never came back. And I think it’s not that unusual.

Depression has made my life so unstable for 5 years...But with Wellbutrin and a supportive employer I'm having a turn around!,"TL;DR You should try some kind of treatment for your depression and anxiety, and let your employer know what you deal with. It is helping me immensely.   


I dropped out of school 3 years into a math degree at a research level university after sudden onset of extreme hypochondria which has led to sustained anxiety and depression.   


5 years later I am 4 online classes away from a trash degree from university of phoenix online. I've coped with anxiety/depression with alcohol, gambling, sexual thrill seeking, years long video game binges, and overeating. This led to a bankruptcy, over 30 different jobs in the last 5 years(most lasting less than 1 month) I've spent more time unemployed than employed in this time period by far.  


I lie to my wife about my unhealthy habits. I tell her I'm going to work, when I'm going to a casino. I tell her I'm hanging out at a park when I'm getting shitfaced at a strip bar(then eventually kicked out). My life is just riddled with bullshit stupid things I do to try to feel better.

The first time I actually tried an antidepressant was about a month and a half ago(cymbalta) which made me manic and unable to feel my penis during sex. I switched to wellbutrin after a week long bender that ended with my parents finding my lame 28 year old ass sleeping in my car outside the local indian casino with a pile of wine bottles in the passenger seat.   


The wellbutrin has been hit and miss so far, it gave me a lot more energy and motivation sometimes, but sometimes I just feel like I'm paralyzed stuck in a dark spot. I've also had much less negative thoughts on this medicine. 

Right now I'm sitting on 2 and a half weeks with a new job as a business to business salesperson. During the interview for this job was the first time I EVER had an employer ask me if I dealt with a disability that could effect my performance. He has shown empathy ever since I mentioned it and tried to support me and make sure I'm feeling ok throughout my time I've worked with him. I REALLY HOPE I CAN KEEP THIS JOB! 

Having a job like this helps me feel some purpose in my life. Something that has been missing for a long time. I am finally feeling motivated and confident for the first time in ages. I walk into businesses and lay my balls on the front desk. I've had some success and that is thrilling. The flurry of ""We will call you if we need you""s and other rejections haven't fazed me thus far.  


I wish I hadn't been scared to try an antidepressant 5 years ago, and I wish I would have told my employers the living hell I live with. Things could have gone a lot better.",t2_56n0dpb2,1,0

Advice on how to get help,"Hello, about two years ago I went through a seriously traumatic situation and I've had to continue experiencing it in a lesser way. Basically now my ex husband who brutalized me took my daughter and I rarely get to see her. I'm not here for custody advice, I just think it needs to be explained as to why I can't change my situation much.

I went to my doctor about a year ago and asked for help with my anxiety and depression that's just gotten worse and worse as time goes on, very much relating to the situation with my daughter. He recommended therapy. He didn't want To give me anything. I started seeing a therapist weekly. It helped some for awhile but a couple months ago I started really slipping again. I now feel I'm at a point where I can't hold myself up. I've expressed this to my husband. He's supportive but he can't help me much other than push me back to the doctor. I had to switch clinics because of my insurance. This doctor also doesn't want to give me anything. She just wants me to keep trying therapy.

I'm not really sure how to make them listen to me. I've told them I was traumatized. I've told them how bad my depression is. I've told them I'm barely functional right now. What do I do? How much more therapy do I have to try to get medication to help me through this? How am I suppose to get help when I keep reaching out to them and they don't help.

"I need some advice people, please..","Hello, I've dealt with anxiety (mainly health anxiety) for the past **months.** I've reached this point that I've finally beat it (couple of weeks ago) , meaning that I stopped worrying about issues and start enjoying stuff more. One day at a time and I was finally starting to get my energy/strength back , to start attending my University again (2nd year) and start producing music again.

2 weeks ago , 4th semester started. I already had random moments in my day , especially after a good meal , that I felt a bit sleepy, but since I was done with looking up sh\*t online and had **no** other weird symptoms I decided that's it's nothing serious. It's Monday and I get ready to get back at it and try my best and be as productive as possible etc. without overdoing it obviously. Again, one day at a time.

But, something was completely off. Seriously. I felt sleepy, tired, fatigued , weak , bored. I can't even describe the feeling I felt those days. It got a bit better but I can tell you the situation is pretty much the same for 2 weeks. I don't have any other issues. I am 19 and had some blood work done today. Results will be ready tomorrow. (I do them on March every year). 

The other mental thing I feel is like a brain fog thing, when I have to do something I feel like I will lift 10.000 KGs on my back. My upper body feels...I don't know , sore? Weak? Tired? Bored? Again I can't find the right words. There are moments that I feel great , but if I hear, feel or see something that I dislike to hear/feel or see I instantly start feeling like cr@p. Tired etc. I can't really describe you the situation.

Oh and since I've dealt with health anxiety and know pretty much all health conditions that exist. I've convinced myself without knowing it that I have cancer or multiple sclerosis/ALS. 

**My question to you is..** Do you feel the same? Could I have a mild form of depression? I feel lost, tired and emotionally drained. Instead of feeling afraid I feel nothing, I feel like I have destroyed my body's neurological system/adrenal glands. This sucks hard time. 

**Thanks for reading to those who did. If not..**

**TL;DR : I feel tired/drained/bored/fatigued etc. most of the day, I do have ""mood swings"", when I have to do an ""obligation"" I feel terrible , irritated. I feel lost , alone and bad most of my day for the past 2 weeks or so.

How do I deal with that I will never have a girlfriend?,"My ideal dream, even now, is to have a girlfriend and someday marry her, start a family and have a child. I've always been by pure nature a very sincere, affectionate, fun, funny but focused person at the same time, attentive, who knows how to listen and that I know that if a single girl deigned to know me even if it's a bit I know that she'd like me.

However, I know that I'll never ever get anything similar in my whole life and it's doomed to loneliness. And this isn't something that I just believe, I know perfectly. Among other things, because I'm not from the USA or the American continent and things in my country in particular are very different since here there are NO attentive girls directly, only the superficiality is undeniably the order of the day (and where I don't leave winning)

In addition, to all this is added the fact that I don't like to go out there and I find it extremely barbaric to speak a single syllable before a woman.

And even then, even knowing this and accepting it, I have a hard time assimilating it and that all the years that I still have left of life will be monotonous one after the other mired in total solitude, because I don't even have a single female friend nor does it seem that I'm going to have (although I don't have so many male friends too).

One of my outings could have been the online dating websites, but I know perfectly well that they don't really work.

And I promise that I'm not someone demanding. Just any girl who understands me a little would be enough and left over.",t2_5uj0rk0p,6,0

Depression is seriously kicking my ass,"I can't understand why I'm not able to get my life back.

Depression/anxiety and heart rate variability,"I am reading now that low heart rate variability is linked to depression and anxiety. I don't understand that. I thought it's the opposite, like if someone has stable 60 heart rate it's good. Explain someone pls

Or maybe it's like, if someone has higher heart rate, like 80 and it's elevated by stress, it means they can't lower this easily like normal healthy people. Like, normal people will have 80 then it drops again to 60 and they are coping with stress much easier and faster than someone with depression/anxiety. Like, maybe people with depression/anxiety have elevated higher rate for a longer period of time with less changes. Am I understanding that correctly?",t2_57giezrv,1,0

High-functioning denial. How do you ask for help?,"I've had depression since I was a teenager. It's a lot more under control now that I'm in my late 20's, but a few days a week it'll hit me again. I've seen counselors before. Latest one for about a year and a half. They've helped, but I get so mad at myself because I feel like I can't beat this. I feel like I am so fortunate to have the resources and support that I have, so it makes me feel more ashamed that I can't take advantage of those things and help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm back in college after a long hiatus, and the depression has really been interfering. I have identified this pattern: A bad thought comes, triggering self-doubt and self-loathing. This can lead to suicidal thinking and isolating myself to a point where I become sort of paralyzed and I hate myself so much I don't want to tell anyone what's going on. I just want myself to suffer. I doubt my ability to even attempt, much less complete my schoolwork. Even simple assignments or filling out simple forms. So I end up delaying and procrastinating to avoid the fear that I won't do a good enough job. Then I end up missing the deadline, and then I skip class. I tell myself I'll catch up and turn it in at the next class session, but I almost never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel embarrassed to go to that next class without the assignment completed, and I tell myself I'll do it by the next class. But then I feel so angry with myself for not doing it, and for being lazy and procrastinating and getting into this situation again. Then I try to work on it, but I'm not satisfied with my attempt, so I put it away, frustrated. This happens over and over again, and meanwhile, of course, I'm missing class and missing all the new assignments, and falling behind in one class affects my attitude about my other classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my situation is not that bad. Other people have it much worse. I feel so guilty and ashamed for struggling with this for so long. I've had to push my graduation back so many times, and my parents have been footing the bill. I know there are people who can't even afford to go to college, or they have to take out a loan for it. I'm lucky, and I'm wasting the opportunity I have because I can't get my act together.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying and I have been trying, but I think one of the major things holding me back is my hesitation to ask for help. I am usually the person that other people go to for help and advice. I seem confident and I am a natural leader. People like me and feel comfortable around me, and I really genuinely care about others. I try to help people as often as I can, and it makes me feel good to be there for others, even if it's just to put my arm around their shoulder or just show them that I'm listening.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason, I don't allow myself that same comfort. It's almost like I stop myself from having that connection with others. I don't know how to let people comfort me. I feel ashamed and I feel like they will be mad at me and disappointed in me if they knew how much I'm struggling with something that it seems like everyone else is able to handle. I feel that way a lot with my mom and dad, like they are frustrated with me for not being over this after so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky to have several close friends. Even though they don't have depression or other mental health issues, they really care about me and want to help me. They are always willing to listen and support me, and if they're busy, they try to help as much as they can in whatever capacity they can. I just feel so ashamed for asking them for help. Every now and then, I distance myself from my friends, and I deny that anything is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone around me sees a lot of potential in me. It feels very heavy. When I'm able to lift my head above water, I have so much energy and I am working on different projects and leading volunteer committees and trying to make a positive difference, and I feel good about myself. But the rest of the time, I feel like I will never be able to do what I really want to do because of this recurring depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with my classes. It's not hard. It's not impossible. And I do believe in a higher power. I believe that God can do anything and He can make things easy for people. But with that, I also believe that people have to trust Him and put in the effort to try to help themselves. Even then, the outcome might not always be what they expect, but at least they have tried.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel like I don't care about myself enough to really try. I feel like giving up. People expect so much from me, and I feel like -- without bragging or being pompous -- I could really do something good and beneficial if I were able to get through this and learn to lean on my friends for support.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like because I'm able to hide it well and because I am generally confident and a leader, it doesn't seem like there really is a problem. I have frequent suicidal ideation, but my religious beliefs have always kept me from acting on them. As much as I hate reaching out for help, I still see value and purpose in my life, so I've been able to tell people when I reach that point. I've never been hospitalized, I don't drink or use drugs, I am not violent or angry, I don't physically harm myself.

 

So I feel embarrassed to talk about how depression is affecting me, because I know other people have it much worse. Most of the time I can act like I'm fine. I'm good at denying things to myself and to others. People look at me and they think I have it all together. I don't want to complain to anyone about my issues, because to me it looks like most of my problems stem from my own lack of ability to cope properly. I'm going to a therapist and we've talked about this over and over and over, so I feel that at this point, I really should be able to take steps to help myself.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for 7 years now, it's only getting worse. I feel like a failure. I'm 19, and I have achieved literally nothing so far. I'm basically studying to be a cashier, in my country we have a special high school for that. And if you want to graduate, you need to work almost 700 hours in a grocery shop, clothing shop etc. I can't work because of my depression and anxiety, I always feel like my co-workers and the customers hate me, I also know that a lot of them talk sh* about me behind my back. Some days I can't even leave my bed or house, I feel so miserable. I really wanna finish school, get a job and move out, to make my mom proud. But I can't, and I hate myself for it. I feel like sh* cause she has to cook for me, clean the house, basically do EVERYTHING around the house, and I'm just sitting there doing nothing. I just want to get my sh* together, but it seems impossible. Sometimes I actually feel good for a few days, thinking to myself 'finally'...but then depression hits me all of a sudden again, and I can't do anything but cry cause I'm literally a burden to my poor mother...my only real friend is my brother, who has recently moved out like 2 months ago..and I miss him so bad 24/7, I feel so alone..We used to chill together, play videogames, we basically did everything together...and I fricking miss that. :(
I am currently on antidepressants, but they aren't helping..they just keep giving me bad headaches and nausea.
I also hate the way I look. I feel like the ugliest person, there is literally nothing I like about myself. Not even one thing. And it's not a good feeling to look in the mirror and hate what you see. I don't know what to do. People are saying I'm weird cause I rarely talk, but I just hate myself so much, that I started thinking ""Who would even want to know what a weirdo like me has got to say?"". So I keep quiet and it's making things worse..
Also lost quite a lot of friends, cause I don't reply to their messages..I just can't understand why someone would care about a failure like me. I always think that they secretly hate me and that I'm doing them a favor by not replying to their texts. I fail at every single thing I do, I'm useless. I can't even think straight anymore.

Fu#k Happiness,"We are not meant to be happy all of the time, or most of the time, or a fair bit of the time.

We are meant to feel bad when bad things happen. And even when good things happen we have evolved to keep an eye out for potential bad things that could threaten us.

So bad things fill our minds most of the time. Every advertisement tries to sell us happiness because it's not normal to have it. Buy this new car and you will be happy. Buy this new house and you will be happy. Buy this new game and you will be happy. Buy these new clothes and you will be happy. Buy this holiday and you will be happy.

And for a split second we are. Then that fades, because again we aren't meant to be happy very often.

So fuck happiness. We don't need you anyway.

Now I know most people will say go find a therapist and I want her to but as her BF should I also make an attempt to go with her(we live an hour away so attempt my very best to go), or let her sort it out herself and let me help aid her in what she learned about herself.?

Just got fired from my second job ever.,"I have graduated last year and ever since I've been looking for a job. I tried applying as a teacher, cashier, sales assistant, secretary anything and I've been looking for a whole year. Few months ago I got a job at this call center and withing two weeks I got fired because I wasn't making any sales. The second job was last month, I worked as a cashier for two weeks and at the end of the second week I got fired when I asked why they said I was making a lot of mistakes. The thing is that I haven't even begged them to stay I was actually glad they fired me. It was a really shitty job, I had to deal with a lot of rude customers, problems, my managers were impatient and unhelpful and always wanted me to solve problems on my own even though I was new and basically knew nothing. The pay was really low too and they made me work two weeks in a row, 8 hours a day with some few extra hours thrown here and there, I even cried the last day of my second week because they made me work two weeks in a row (this was my second job ever and I was exhausted both physically and mentally). I have also applied to qatar airways and gulf air to become a flight attendant and got rejected both times because I had a little scratch scar on my arm. My boyfriend on the other hand is smart he is an engineer, he landed a job at this company just a few weeks after his graduation except that the company he's working for now is sort of exploiting them and he's busy, tired and grumpy most of the time, so now we barely see each other (we live in different startes) and I feel like our relationship just keeps getting worse and worse everyday, I mean I love him, but since he started working his personality changed, he's grumpy, gets irritated fast, and I feel like he dosen't even like me anymore. Seeing that I've been unemployed for a whole year and that I got fired again just two weeks into my new job my parents were pretty pissed at me my dad even insulted me (they probably think am lazy and I dropped out). So now I just feel pretty miserable, I never leave my room, my bed, am loosing interest in everything, I am very depressed, I feel like I'll never achieve anything, I regret everything from life choices like my major (English literature) not studying mathematics hard enough in highschool not choosing a good scientific major, getting the scratch scars on my arm (from self harm) I wasted so much time ..

I would give my left hand to see the guy who tried to coerce me into doing sexual favors doe,"I would give my left hand to see the guy who try to coerce me into doing sexual favors die in front of me.

He didn’t get what he wanted but he fucked up my self esteem for a long time. Basically I made the mistake of opening up to him about my depression etc and then got the idea that he should send a dick pic and me something back to make me feel special (creepy, I should’ve just blocked him then but I was really low and I thought he was sweet at the time)

Anyway then we get into an argument and he tries to make things sexual again and this time he wanted me to send a video of me masturbating and send it to him because it would “blow off steam” we went in circles for a while until I blocked him. 

Then he messages me on what’s app and I blew up on him for trying to force me to see my pussy. He said that he just wanted me to be happy and I said when did I fucking ask to be a free hooker? Anyway then he blocked me at that point. But I was still super angry about the whole thing. At him and at myself too for not knowing better.

I know he did this to other girls as well so I gathered evidence like screenshots etc and I found out where he worked. He had some business with some other girl and told her what a creep and predator he is. Now he deleted all his social media and his business’s social media too.

I still hate him so much. It might be extreme but I fucking hate entitled men with a passion. He deserves to gets his ass beat and I hate the fact that I will never be able to do it.

We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,1869,0

I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked,"So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. 

When she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.

So fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.

TL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.

Edit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things.",t2_2cd736ed,710,0

I wonder what he was thinking and feeling.

I think about the time he was caught on CCTV footage slumped in front of a building window. Was he fighting tears? Was he trying to tell himself to stop? Was he trying to talk himself into continuing to walk to the bridge.

I wonder if he was hoping someone would talk him out of doing it those two weeks.

The seasonal depression has me crying all day that first week of daylight savings. Sometimes I feel medium and when I'm medium I'm ok. I'm good at acting like things are well. And I'm a very affectionate supportive person. So people see me as a really positive vibrant figure in their life. When I go through depressive episodes every 3-4 months or so, people are appalled. With relationships, I'm very open. I tell them ahead of time. Like hey, I have panic attacks sometimes and I can't control them completely. Hey, I have depression and sometimes cry for no reason and lay in bed all day. Hey, the winter is hard for me and I cry a lot during it. And they are like sureeee ok. And then when it happens, they abandon ship because people are awful. People say they care about mental illness but they really do not.

Life's is a constant downwards spiral,"Everyone close to me is leaving me. My family makes fun of me or yells at me. Past joys don't bring much happiness.

My only distractions are music and sports but the seasons are over and I don't have much time to listen to music.

Fuck this, and fuck looking for attention, is this what I get for asking for help? and who would cut themself for attention?

I can’t tell my family because they will make me feel worse. My brother attempted suicide and now my family is hateful to him, and mistreating him.

"Just a small venting, if you dont mind","These last 12 months, my whole life kind of flipped. It turned out for the better, and I couldnt be more thankful. I'm getting a nice promotion soon, I'm more independent, I'm more in control of my finances, and I've made some really good friends this last year.

But damn if it isnt difficult going through with every day. I'm exhausted mentally. My fault, since I've established myself as the comedic relief of those that I know at home and at work. 

It is difficult trying to keep others from feeling what I'm feeling. It is difficult just keeping up the feigned happiness. Yeah, I'll feel joy sometimes, but I'm so emotionally dead. I think I'm starting to abuse smoking weed, even though it also helps me medically for muscle weakness. I'm constantly high, trying to keep myself from the crushing sense of self hatred and depression. 

It's a lot. It's too much to handle sometimes. I'm slowly learning that I'm not even actually living, just existing. I work all of the time, and when I'm home, I'm doing nothing. I'm surrounding myself with games and entertainment, but still finding myself idle and in bed...angry, sad, confused, lonely, and empty. My thoughts scream at me to do something, and then when I do it, I find myself trying to distract myself into something else.

Has rendered me stunned, dazed

How can one person make you want to die .,"I have this “friend” and I really am starting to hate her. I’ve really only been nice to her. We were both in a friend group and when the friend group split up she was having trouble finding friend so she stayed with me because we didn’t have any beef unlike the other people. And I had quite a lot of friends, but when she came she kinda took them from me like they started not talking to me and started texting her and talking to her lunch. So now I am really alone. For her birthday I wanted her to know I still liked her so I got her a lot of stuff, and she gave me hot sauce packets from the lunches. She is pretty rich, so I don’t see why she couldn’t have given me something that actually has value, since I gave her $30+ worth of stuff. And I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, and she just me 10x worse. Her thing is if she doesn’t get what she wants from you, she whines for a bit calls you mean then goes and talks behind your back. That’s how I lost some friends, because I didn’t pay for her stuff. She didn’t have enough money, and I only had enough for myself. She got all pissed and started her whines and shit. I’m done with her, but there is no escaping her hell, she has all my closest friends in her palm. One word said about me I’ll lose all of them. She thinks she’s better than every one else, prettier, skinner. Her being 85 pounds still saying everyday “I’m so fat omg”. She always says her hairs bad and her face is ugly and round everyday. She always says she doesn’t have friends when she took all my friends making them dislike me so she can have more friends. She has probably 50+ friends now, always has someone to talk to, always texting someone. Gets a lot of bday and Christmas presents. Likes to rub it in that’s she’s better than me.   You are probably like, “just find some new friends!” You see I can’t, my school is small and has little people. And everyone else are ghetto girls and “hot Cheeto girls”. I’m stuck in this hell for 2 more years. My family is messed up, my parents hate me, think I’m a disgrace. They ignore me everyday, all they do is send me to school, pick me up. And they manage to do that without saying a word to me. My grades are horrible, I will probably never get in college which will upset my family even more. I have no talents, nothing to live for. I have no real friends, but I’m scared of loneliness. I want to escape this hell. I want to die. I feel like I won’t live past 20.

My story made as short as possible.
40 yrs old

6 or 7 find out I'm G/R colorblind

7 find it I'm dyslexic as well

Up till about 11 I was sexually abused by Ann old family member

14 parents separated father became part time

17 first spine surgery for a herniated disc groom a MVA in which I was a passenger

20-24 I underwent 4 mite some surgeries, and then was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at 24 yrs old (turns out probably didn't need all of those surgeries as it was MS symptoms not some issues for some things)

36-One highlight in the last 20 years or so is I achieved a bachelor's degree which was something I very much wanted to do. Sadly I'm indebted for eternity and no better off for it outside of its something I wanted to do. 

Now I'm 40 have zero savings on soc sec and don't see much of a future. Once my land lady dies (she is 95) I'll likely end up homeless. 

I'm fucking depressed. I live in a society that has little sympathy for the chronically ill. I'm constantly in pain from the spine surgeries I probably didn't need. It's just wrong to have to live a life of indignity because I was born with fucked  immune system.

Your ‘impossible task’,"https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/depression-impossible-task-symptoms-sadness-twitter-a8515436.html%3famp
Do you have an impossible task? Have you been able to get past it? How?

For me it’s applying for jobs. I currently work 2 12 hour night shifts a week. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but night shift when you’re already dealing with MDD, anxiety, OCD and anorexia is horrific. Not to mention I’ve had to deal with so many awful people who have destroyed what limited confidence I had to begin with. I feel scared before every shift, and my dread begins all over again the moment I walk out of the lab. I’ve been at the job two years, over which time the MDD has gotten far worse and I’ve tried to kill myself twice, landing myself in hospital against my will three times. EVERYONE in my life has said I need to get out of it. 

The problem? CV and cover letter. That’s it. I can work 12 hour night shifts. I run marathons. I starve myself for days on end. I attained a degree in Biomedical Science. But sitting down for 1-2 hours to write a cover letter? Impossible. I just can’t. And I can’t explain why. The only reason I got this job is because I did heaps of work experience with them first. And before that I did conservation work at a wetland during the Australian summer despite having severe allergies and cholinergic urticaria. I knew it would be hell physically. But I went for it simply because it didn’t require a cover letter. That’s it. 

Do you have an impossible task? Have you been able to get past it? How?

In addition, I don’t know why, but i started to feel attraction towards other guys and it terrified me. I felt so guilty about it that i had to let chris know. I felt like i was falling out of love and didn’t want him to be stuck in a relationship with me that would be unfair to him as well. I felt like he deserved someone who also loved him in the same way. During this time, we would still hang out in the same friend group. He still wanted to be friends with me, so i agreed. He even let me stay at his place still, when he had friends over (this is my first mistake, I should have said no, but i also still loved him as a friend so it was always nice to still be with him, selfish of me). During this time though, he got super protective over me and still expected me to be his girlfriend, even though i made it clear that i didn’t feel the same anymore. I thought my relationship with his friends were platonic and harmless (and some of them i was friends with on my own accord). But he was so mad when he found out that I would hang out without him (even though, I would plan on seeing him later with them as well) he would get mad if I wouldn’t be back at a certain time. It was my fault for allowing myself to stay over. I probably gave him the wrong ideas. But he would get so angry and lash out at me, and curse at me and call me names. I’ll admit, my intentions weren’t alway pure. I would invite him to things with our friends still, but lowkey didn’t want him to come because I wanted to be independent without him. I wanted to know what it would be like to be single without his presence. He would get so mad when I wasn’t responding this one time. I invited him at first out of courtesy, but it was fucked up of me to not respond or respond late because I couldn’t decide if I actually wanted him there. Totally my fault and I feel awful about it. I was being selfish. The next day when I saw him, he was so angry and vehement, he threw his phone across the room and it accidentally hit me. It made a gigantic bruise on my thigh and i got scared. Later on, we went on a group tahoe trip. He was complaining that I wasn’t paying enough attention to him, but that wasn’t the case, he just wanted to believe what he wanted to and made a huge scene and hit the wall. I was so angry because it felt like he wanted to control me so i would purposely go out, when he would be in the room and vise versa just to show him that i didn’t care. We were already sleeping in the same bed, which is what he requested from me so i complied (this was a vicious cycle of feeling bad for him and not thinking about the implications of what it meant to say “yes”). I’m stupid and should have just cut off everything from him since i knew he still had feelings. For some reason i thought it could somehow still work if we were still friends somehow which was naive and dumb of me. I finally moved into my own apartment and stopped staying at his place. But he would still force his presence and drive to my apartment without my permission. During this time, i didn’t realize it, but i had feelings for one of his friends. I felt awful about it, and didn’t know what to do. I knew he liked me too, because he confessed to chris that he did and felt guilty about it. I felt the same way, and told him how i felt. We ended up becoming a thing and this is when i started distancing myself from chris. I would see him every now and then during group gatherings and other obligations. I knew if we were still going to be in the same friend group i had to tell him that him that the other guy and i were a thing. I ended up sending him a letter telling him that I have feelings for the other guy and that i'm incredibly sorry that i feel this way (i didn’t want to tell him we were already a thing because i was too afraid to hurt his feelings). When i told him, he drove to my place and told me to get in the car. During this time, he went beserk. He drove the car around like crazy, threw my phone out the window and threatened to end my life, leak my old nudes, and expose me to my parents. He dug his nails into my skin really hard out of anger. He ended up feeling bad and found my phone and gave it to me. After this i stopped seeing him. However, me and the other guy that i had a thing with ended up not being compatible. He ended up sexually assaulting me. He would come back to my place several times that night and was hitting the windows multiple times to try to get me out, even though I had fled to my friend’s place. My roommate texted and warned me about this. I would report this to the police the next day. That night, the other guy also ran into chris at the gym. He was drunk and belligerent and ended up telling chris that we had been a thing. chris called me in panic, I told him we had been seeing each other, but no other details. I was so disgruntled and had no one to turn to that I also told him about the assault. After hearing this, of course, he was furious and went to go try to beat him up. The other guy called me and told me to lie about the assault and to tell chris that i didn’t, so he wouldn’t get beat up. I felt so awful, this was definitely the lowest point of my life so far. chris felt bad and offered me to stay at his place for comfort and even told me that he doesn’t expect me to get back with him. I eventually told him that him and i had been in a relationship and had intercourse. This broke his heart and he told me that to make him feel better about this that he wanted to do it with me and in a sense “reclaim me.” I accepted this because I felt like it was the least i could do in order to make up for hurting him like this (i know, this was a really messed up way of thinking). Afterwards, everything was so fucked up that i told him that it’s probably best i didn’t stay at his place anymore, even though i appreciated his offer so much. After this, the other guy reached out to try to apologize properly. I agreed to see him to receive this apology, and he did apologize, but not really in the way that i wanted to. He kissed me and i fell for it. I thought he was genuine. But the next morning, i realized he wasn't. After i went to edc with my friends, i actually met up with chris because we always dreamed about edc so we thought meeting up for a day would only be proper. After coming back from edc with my friends, i realized that i was an idiot, completely stupid, and believed in the other guy when he wasn’t sorry at all. I texted him calling him out and saying that i’m better off without him. I blocked him from everything. chris found out about this from another friend and went beserk again. I don’t blame him, it was my fault again. He went to my house at 2am and told my parents everything that’s been going on.

One of the biggest things that i’ve learned from this experience is to just be more considerate of people’s feelings. My whole life actually, i’ve been a really nice person and super considerate of others, so it just shocks me to my core looking back how i didn’t consider chris’s feelings as much as i should have. I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life. I made mistake after mistake because of selfish reasons. I’m trying to move past this, and i think the first step is writing it down. A lot of my anxiety has come from the trauma that these events caused. I hope that by writing this down, I can be more honest with myself and understand these feelings of mine. For a while i was running away from this guilt, but I need to own up to it so that i never make these mistakes again. I hope that by materializing these thoughts, I can also make a more active progression to change. I have been dealing with so much self-loathing and hate for myself because i just know how fucked up everything got. Just reading this leaves me in bewilderment.

After things settled down, chris and tried to give our relationship another chance. We’ve been trying new things to work on attraction, and since he’s been so nice to me, it’s been progressing. Despite everything, i’ve known him for almost 6 years and i care and love him so much that life seems unbearable without him. He has forgiven me, but i can’t seem to forgive myself just yet. I want to be a better person, and i want to not let these acts define me (but what if i deserve to let it define me?). But sometimes, it’s hard because my anxiety from all this comes back. I feel sometimes like i don’t deserve chris. I fucked up, so i should live with the consequences. I feel so worthless that i get anxiety attacks. I have overcome this a bit through time, but it seeps back every now and then. This is interfering with the current relationship that I want to work out because if this guilt is always plaguing me, I feel like i can’t fully be present in my relationship now. I know most of you might not be able to sympathize with me, but i just need advice. It has been almost a year since all of this transpired. I have a much better support system of friends that i've never had before that i can convincingly say i know got my back, and am in a better place, so I do feel very grateful about this. I just feel so down about myself at times. Prior to all of this, my life has always been non-problematic and i've always had a good moral compass on my shoulder. However, i just can't help but feel so worthless at times. But any words of encouragement would help if you see fit. Sometimes it still feels like im hanging by a thread here.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: BIG SIDE NOTE. The worst part about everything is that I lost my entire group of friends that i made through them. I was dishonest at first about me and the other guys’ relationship because i was scared. But after they found out i was in a relationship with him and that i got assaulted, they all just blamed us for keeping our relationship a secret and didn’t think much of the assault just because we were in a relationship already. This was a big part of why i wanted to die for a while as well (should have added this in). It propelled me into feeling more worthless and unheard than ever before (please any advice on getting over carrying resentment for this would be amazing). I also think that i just have this undying love for chris because of how long i’ve know him, and try to understand him because i just feel so guilty of everything i inflicted. I want to go to therapy but right now it’s not at option so resorting to reddit. A thousand thank yous to people who took the time to read - you're amazing.

I really struggle to find enjoyment in things and i just don't see the point in being alive most of the time,"I don't know why i feel like this, I'm 21 and most of my friends are enjoying themselves and getting fucked up on the weekends. I just can't find it in me to enjoy anything , I try to at least work out regularly and i have a couple of close friends I've made throughout my life but other than that i just don't see the point in being alive. I can't shake the thought that it doesn't matter what i do with my life because one day I'll die anyway, truth be told I'd probably have ended it a while ago to speed up the process if not for the intense fear of death. Its hard to discuss this with people as they mostly assume I'm either being dramatic or nihilistic. It's almost like my fucking brain just doesn't allow itself to be happy like a regular persons.",t2_q3sbm,6,0
I wish i had friends,"(To start off I’m 16, male, haven’t been to school for a couple years for these reasons) So idk if this belongs here it’s just a rant pretty pointless but recently I’ve been feeling somewhat depressed, a few years ago I ended up developing social anxiety and isolated myself from the littlest of friends that I had at the time.
Recently I’ve been seeing a therapist and I’ve started feeling a little better and started leaving the house, only issue is idrk how to interact with people so it’s pretty hard for me to make friends  especially with not being in school

Not too long ago someone I knew on Snapchat ended up being a real dick and told me no one would ever want to be friends with me for reasons she wouldn’t say (?) so that has made me feel like total shit for about a week.
Anyways I went out yesterday and I came across someone I used to know as a kid, wasn’t really ever friends but we knew each other. We talked for a while and he put his number in my phone. The thing is, the number isn’t in service and he typed it fast so I’m not sure if he gave me a fake number or fucked it up by typing it so fast.

I was in that area this afternoon and I decided to leave a note in his door saying that the number said it wasn’t in service and left my number at the bottom. It’s late at night now and I still haven’t heard from him. 

I’m probably overreacting and he probably did just put it in wrong, but he did it really fast so idk. I feel like he gave me a fake number but he’s the one who talked to me and offered me his number, so idk why he’d give me a fake one 🤷‍♂️

Ugh I just feel like no one likes me or wants to talk to me and it’s been making me feel more and more depressed, I just feel like I’ll always be lonely and live a shitty life. I look good, I have a great personality, I’m fun and easy to talk to, so idk why I can never make or keep friends ☹️",t2_5u7u5b6q,8,0
What is happening to me,"Trigger warning: non consensual touching

Recently I was non consensually touched by one of my closest friends. We were drunk but he thought I was asleep when he touched me. Ever since, even though I have told school and my family and friends know, I haven’t been able to be truly happy. Nothing feels the same anymore, I shut myself off and don’t talk to anyone. I literally only reply to my boyfriends messages with “okay”. My parents are supportive but I can’t tell them what I’m feeling. I just feel so empty inside and making myself sad is so much better than the pure emptiness and nothingness that I usually feel. I have thought about hurting myself, and I searched my room for something to use but I couldn’t find anything. I don’t want to be that desperate to hurt myself again but it will happen. Please any advice will help I don’t know how to get help or find support.",t2_5vskwbbw,3,0

Nothing satisfies me.,"Growing up i allways felt like an outsider. It would take me allot longer to interact with other kids, as if i was first observing behaviour and judging before i could relate and connect with them. Everything felt like it was missing a piece and just because ""things happen"" wasnt acceptable to me. So i grew up analyzing soo much so so much that i lack that guillable and ignorant way of enjoying little things in life... I actually envy one friend in particular in which i deem the dumbest of us.. He can blabber, get amazed, shocked, worried about relatively nonsense things HE CAN actually small talk. So ive allways known i have a different perspective in life i am Now im 25 and feel like i got a hold of myself... To a point but in was in my highschool years i went through the typical crush then gf then betrayed scenario (happens to almost every1), that my out of the normal rational spiraled out of my control. Kept analyzing Every Single Detailed that happened day by day, in the hopes that id find paterns to correct myself. It felt like i was talking to myself saying ""you're in this sad state, and its only you're fault. You're the one who keeps getting into this... How about you unfuck yourself"". And so to avoid putting myself in situations in which i didnt feel comfortable i turned to educating myself HARD.. On how to read peoples posture, body language, tone of voice. Some would say it completley messed me up as a human, on the bright side though, i am confident enough to sit at a poker table, whilest cocky enough that i wont loose. And so about 3 - 5 times a year i get into unsatisfying state where theres nothing i can do which causes pleasure. I can now feel creep on me. Tend to start masturbating more, spending more money, sleeping more, reading more, playing video games more. I know how to handle it so i can damage control, tend to sleep more and educate myself with youtube or reading articles so i can indulge whilest keeping it away from my pocket. And while i can somewhat handle it i cant actually neither prevent it or end it. like its coming, so brace for impact. Its here, so deal with it. Its gone, try to enjoy anything... While you still can. And i feel like its getting progresively worse. I am currently running in this state which i got no name of it, and really needed to express myself in some way or to someone... I apologize if this isnt the sub to do such a thing.",t2_1567ie,5,0

"I’m having one of those nights where i feel like dying rn. I [24f] hate myself and a lot of my depression and anxiety stems from this.

Do you feel like there should be a word for something worse and deeper than depression?,"I feel like I've been at all different levels of depressed at some point in time. I can feel the differences, they're easy to recognize. But, sometimes, like now, there becomes a point where I'm so far past all the stereotypical depression stuff that I almost wrap back to ""normal""-ish... except... everything is far from normal. I function but I'm not really living. My mind is blank. I don't think about dying nor living. I'm exhausted and can't put into words how I feel about one thing or another because I don't know.

Im not in a state to help my suicidal friend,"For context, im 16 years old, my friend is 19 and lives on her own in another country so keep that in mind. 

Almsot 3 days ago she texted me that she was going to kill herself, she was very clear about how she was going to do it, how im should let her go, how "" it's not respectful to ask someone to live if their life isn't liveable"", you know, the whole ""im going to take all the pills- it's not working i didn't take enough- im gonna try stabbing myself- I'll sit outside until i freeze to death "" line. Ofc i was calling her and i actually texted her ex to call an ambulance( he's the only person i can contact in her country and he knows where she lives) but he didn't read it and i deleted it once i realized she'll survive. She's alive obviously and is acting like nothing happened.

Now this isn't the first time, it's actually probably the 5th time ( that i know of ), everytime it's like this, everytime she talks that way. Im usually not scared as i have been where she was multiple times, but this recent time? It triggered me, i feel exhausted, i want to harm myself which i haven't felt in months. She doesn't want professional help , im her only trusted source of support and i genuinely can't anymore. This is a cycle, she find someone to date, things are seemingly well and so is her mental health, it doesn't work out, she's suicidal, after 2 weeks, she starts talking to people again and doing risky things. She got drunk as fuck, she said she's meeting with a guy at his place and i think he's from tinder so that's not safe. Im tired, she's always dismissive of her feelings or expresses them in very concerning ""jokes"" ( i get it, coping mechanism but it's harmful if that's all you do). Im tired, im dealing with my own issues and have been suppressing them for months for her, i lose sleep ( time zones) for her, i genuinely take my phone everywhere and grab it st every notification because im so worried about her. Its a cycle, i know that i need to have a serious conversation with her but i know she'll make it into a fight ( we never fought but i know her) and will lose trust and probably attempt but the way things are heading? That might happen to me as well,considering my last episode wasn't that long ago.  How the fuck do i help her and myself? Is it normal that i resent her?is it fair that she relies on me or does she just trust me that much?

Numbness,"For the whole month of February I was stressed out and would start crying at any time or place ( embarassing lol). I was in a really stressful situation and when I finally got out of it I couldn’t feel anything. For the past two weeks or so I feel no emotions. I try to distract myself by going out or spending time with friends, watching things that usually made me laugh but nothing sparks in me. When I’m out with people I have to force myself to smile or look interested because I feel nothing and I just keep zoning out. Even when I spend time with loved ones I feel out of it and I feel bad because I am not reciprocating the feeling at the moment because of this numbness. I don’t know what I should do.",t2_50wu0t2y,5,0
I've run out of empathy.,"I'm so exhausted from dealing with my own mental illness, I cant think about how others are feeling. I got into an argument about something dumb with a family member. Apparently I hurt their feelings, but I just cant fucking care. I know I'm an ass, but sometimes I'm too fucking tired. I know my mental health has negative effects on those around me, but I cant give a shit. I'm not going to make their lives easier by pretending I'm okay; I'm not. I cant give a shit about the millions of people dying everyday, I cant give a shit about all the disasters that go on. I just have become numb to anything that doesnt directly involve me. I'm so busy worrying about dumb crap, I cant focus on any larger picture. I feel like I've run out of basic empathy.",t2_5mrdz6vx,5,0
I'm a boring and useless person.,"I'm done. I hate school, and I feel like my (very few) friends don't even want me around anymore. And I feel like it's all my fault. I understand if they don't want to hang out with someone as boring, awkward, annoying and useless as me but it doesn't make it hurt any less. 

I don't want to kill myself, but if I had an option to suddenly disappear, I'd gladly take the chance.",t2_yjqvzw6,2,0
I have no one to talk to.,"I grew up the OutKast. I’ve never had friends or a group of friends and I was emotionally abused by my family. I resorted to music to deal with my issues and ended up getting far in the music business. I’m 22 and signing to interscope in May. I want to keep this anonymous for obvious reasons. I had a boyfriend but he doesn’t understand me anymore. My mom doesn’t understand either. I’ve had depression for about 7 years now but I am just now understanding that is what has been wrong with me. My ex boyfriend always blew my depression off because he thinks I have everything. Because of my career. But the truth is I really don’t have anything because I can’t find happiness. My management only cares about the way I look and how much money im going to be worth. I broke down today working out because I find it very sad that I have to look a certain way to have a successful career. I know it’s a part of the job but sometimes it bothers me. I just want to share love in the world but at the same time I feel so distant. I have music but have no one to share a connection with. I’ve been strong enough to stay away from drugs and alcohol but I’m scared my depression will get worse especially with more pressure on myself and with the business I’m in. I guess I’m just scared for my future. But I will keep fighting until I can find self love and happiness.

Edit: I’m beginning to believe my depression stems from low self worth and lack of connection.",t2_4vdtmhyr,6,0
I feel like I don't know anyone and I don't let anyone one me.,"I feel like I am losing all sense of being a person in a community. For a long time, I have had a thought to everyone is expendable and that everyone, deep down thinks this. It wasn't until recent that these thoughts started have become a believe. 

Is there a feeling associated with friendship? I don't feel anything with people that call me there friend.",t2_3bi4jvn3,3,0
this is where i get off,"i think it’s really time for me this time. i can’t do this anymore. 

i was born in an abusive family, i don’t really feel like providing extensive backstory, but it was bad enough and weird enough that many people throughout my life don’t believe me, and those who have believed me don’t know what to do with me or what to even say. i have been suicidal since i was 7 years old. earlier than that i can remember not wanting to exist but not really being able to articulate it. now as an adult i’m in a terrible, very long term relationship with someone who’s also abusive, in a different way. i don’t go a day without arguing with him several times. it’s always the same shit. it’s practically scripted at this point, i feel like i live in a fucking mirror funhouse. it’s like i can’t get him to give a fuck about me or be considerate towards me. i’ve tried reasoning with him, begging, being basically verbally abusive but he just doesn’t care. nothing changes. he says he loves me but it’s clear that he just likes that i take care of him like i’m his mommy. i’m disabled and in chronic so i can’t hold a real job. couldn’t finish uni because of it. i have crippling social anxiety. this means i’m at home all the time and all of the responsibility falls on me. all of his problems are mine to fix, and my problems fall to the wayside. my whole life people seem to think that putting a roof over my head should be enough. i feel like no one really sees me. i don’t have any friends, my life is so depressing that i’ve fallen out of touch with everyone, or people just stop talking to me because i never have anything positive to share and my life is going nowhere. i used to be a high achiever and now i have nothing. fuck, i don’t even have health insurance now so i can’t even afford my medication. i’m engaged so i could easily change that, but the thought of getting married feels like a nail in the coffin. at least where i am i can fantasize about running away somehow and starting over without having to get a divorce... of course, i couldn’t run very far anyway, without real work experience, a family, a safety net of any kind, or a body that lets me do manual labor. 

anyway, we moved in with my in laws a couple of months ago because a rare, nigh invincible pest took over our apartment and it spiraled out of control. i’ve had nightmares every night and panic attacks every other day since i got out of that infested apartment, because i’ve been terrified that we brought the pest with us despite my level of care and vigilance because again, my fiance doesnt give a fuck and acts like a child all the time. honestly, it was largely his fault that the pest got out of control as i took it upon myself to contain the infestation and came up with a whole plan that he disregarded completely because he felt i was being “overdramatic”. of course, that ended poorly. doesn’t matter. tonight, i found hundreds of tiny bugs crawling all over a vacuum here. we clearly brought them over somehow, i don’t know how, but they’re here and it’s the last straw. i have a phobia of insects, these spread and breed like wildfire, and my in laws are not particularly clean people (not to mention they don’t think anyone is good enough for their son and don’t believe a word that comes out of my mouth). it’s a recipe for disaster and i can’t take it on top of everything else. it feels like a sick fucking joke, that i can’t have friends, a family, or a purpose in life and now apparently i can’t even have a safe place to lay my head at night. i’ve been hiding in the bathroom crying in the shower since it happened and i don’t think i’m going to make it to sunrise. my life has been a fucking series of ridiculous, totally absurd, horrific occurrence after horrific occurrence and there’s nothing i can do about it. i constantly feel like i’m screaming at the top of my lungs in pain in a room full of people while they stare at me blankly and shrug. i’ve felt so, so completely alone since i can remember and so helpless. the only thing i have control over is whether i live or die. i was never meant to be born anyway, my mom was practically raped and wouldn’t have an abortion. she always used to tell me she should’ve thrown me in the dumpster outside the hospital or given me up for adoption. the first time she told me that i was 3 years old. she was probably right, even then.

i don’t know why i even typed this. anyone reading this far is probably laughing at me. my whole existence is a fucking joke. i should die.",t2_55wdnhu2,2,0

Going to a psychiatrist for the first time to deal with depression,"I have suffered from depression on and off for a few years, but it's never been this bad. I am typically the social butterfly of my friends and no one would ever be able to tell I was depressed until recently. Something happened and I began excessively drinking from November till February, not taking a day to be sober. My friends began to worry and reaching out more. It was not until I wanted to commit suicide about two weeks ago for a week straight that I realized it was getting bad. I still constantly go to sleep and never want to wake up. As someone that has never done this before I am just looking for advice on what to do going forward. I am looking to get on medication as I have lost all motivation to do literally anything or socialize with anyone, considering I used to be able to talk to anyone at anytime this is the most noticeable difference in my personality. 

For reference I am a 22 year old guy that takes adderall during times of high volume while in school. If there is anyone that also takes adderall and anti-depressants, do you know of anything I should look out for? Just some advice would be nice as I am scared my depression will get worse and I am worried the suicidal thoughts will also get worse. I want to feel like myself again I haven't felt like that since September and I have began to dread social interactions. Also, I do want to continue drinking as I am in college and enjoy getting drunk, obviously will only drink socially, but want to know if I should or should not drink while taking the medicine? Internet says no but I am also not supposed to drink on adderall and I do it anyway.",t2_wfyv3,3,0
I had a dream about my EX last night and it's messed me up.,"Me and my ex were together for 2 years before we split up. I've taken it very badly but I've been trying my best to move on. 

I had a dream last night that we met up and just caught up on what's happened since we last spoke. It was nice and I think we got back together.

I haven't had this vivid of a dream in ages and it's really messed me up.

In the dream we spoke about how she looks at my reddit account (we both followed each other irl) and saw all the stuff I've been posting in this subreddit. If this is true then I want to say Hey Abi, you wanna catch up? I really miss you.",t2_o2pkc,2,0

The result is the same whether we live or die,"I could die tomorrow before reaching 30, or I could die at 90, and it wouldn't make any difference.

All of life's experiences will fade away as they never happened, you can lead the best life or the worst, you're going to end up in a casket or an urn, and all this life you worked your ass off building will be for nothing. 

Well I'm miserable, I'm in pain, I'm helpless, I have all the reasons in the world to end it all right now. Happy people might get distracted with the frivolous shit in life. But I don't even have that to make me hold on.

I don't want the slavery they call ""life"" anymore. I'll cut my losses and turn the table on society who wants to torment me.

Drowning,"The time 5 am once again, I sit here in the darkness of my room drowning in my thoughts. Thoughts of ""what if"" and ""maybe"" pulling me down further into this vast sea of self destruction like bricks tied to ankles. I try to fight but the more I resist the more knotted it seems to get.

Apparently you can’t have depression if *some* men like your body,"I should be living in bliss because I can be a sexual object- it should mean I can have anything I want in life so I’ve been told by a redditor.

Or is it that I could resort to prostitution if I’m pushed there? Being harassed and abused is a gift and I’m ungrateful.

I can also have no concept of having insecurities apparently, which isn’t even something I’ve ever mentioned having though of course I do. Huge ones.

How long does booking a session with a therapist usually take?,"Just a few months ago i finally got the courage to talk to my family doctor at the health care centre about seeing a professional.. so after a while he got me all the paperwork needed and i was all ready to set an appointment... the thing is... it has been months and they still havent set an appointment... and i feel like its gonna take even longer and i can't afford a private psychiatrist either... i live in Jerusalem and from the looks of it none of the therapists here even speak English so i m gonna have to open up in a language i can barely speak..

For a while after applying for a session.. i felt a little bit better.. i felt like i was making progress...
