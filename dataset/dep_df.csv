"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",t2_1t70,1728,0
Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",t2_1t70,1216,0
Haha help,"Yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I am ""getting help"". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever.",t2_u5zigd9,158,0
Someone please talk to me😢 anyone at all please,"I have absolutely no one to turn to, I feel so alone and I don't know what to do. I've been stuck in my room for 3 days now crying and getting drunk by myself. I can't eat, I can't sleep. I'm so scared and I feel so fucking awful. I've been awake for 2 days straight with the stress. I'm so exhausted. The only time I've been leaving my room is to buy more alchohol I can't stop drinking its the only thing that helps. I'm hurting so bad and have nobody. I feel like the most worthless and ugly human being in the world. Please can somebody just talk to me😞",t2_5a7y2qvy,113,0
I'm usually responding to these posts,I don't feel like I shouldn't be posting this because there a lot more people that need this more than me but can you just tell me you're here? I guess I've been feeling Incredibly alone even in a full classroom and everyone says I have so many friends but half of them are shitty or fake. I don't really want to be here anymore? I love helping people but you also have to bare the burden of knowing that you can't help everyone...,t2_5w7amdt9,32,0
I am a horrible abusive person who undeniably deserved to die.,"I'm going to get straight to the point. When I become particularly mad, I sometimes become violent. Since I was about 12-18 years old, I took this violence out on my brother. He is 8 years younger than me.

When he did things that made me mad I'd become violent with him and verbally abuse him. I hit him, pushed him to the floor, pinched him, whatever. Sometimes I made him bleed slightly. One time he went to school with a bruise on his neck and the school called a cop to our house. My punishment was hardly even a slap on the wrist, all that happened is the cop told me not to do it again. This was only a few months ago. I'm 19 now.

I can't stop thinking about the things I've done to my brother and the fact that I've probably traumatized him for life. The fact that he clearly has anxiety, the fact that he says he wants to kill himself when he gets mad, the fact that he kept skipping school for the longest time, all of that is my fault. I have undeniably ruined his life and I cannot live with that fact on my shoulders every day of my life. It haunts me every night. 

When someone brings up being abused in their life, all I can think of is myself. I am an abuser. I abused a *child*. This isn't just ""sibling rivalry"". There is an 8 year difference between us. I abused him when I was 18. Legally an adult. There's no excuses. 

I think that I am on the same level as a rapist. I've violated him, just in a different way. I've likely given him self esteem issues for the rest of his life. I will never be forgiven and I shouldn't be. What I did was inexcusable and the only way my brother can ever face some semblance of justice is for me to die. I can't continue living knowing what I've done to him. 

A simple apology will not cut it. I'm sure many people have received apologies from their abusers but that didn't make it better. No one ever forgives their abusers. I deserve to die. I deserve to die in an incredibly painful way. I do not come here expecting sympathy and any reason people give me to not kill myself is invalid. If you think I should live, you are validating an abuser. I need to die. I expect most people to agree. A good person would agree.",t2_5wgahit1,38,0

Suicidal Ideation,"I’ve been on Prozac, Lexapro, Abilify, and Lorazepam. I’ve been in therapy for a year. I try so hard to find interest in things, I force myself to leave the house, nothing is working. I really need some advice from people who’ve come out of some really dark depressive episodes. I feel like my suicidal ideation has taken over my life and that nothing feels real anymore. I know deep down I don’t want to die but my depression is killing me. Idk what to do anymore. If anyone with any advice that suffers with major depression, not just feeling sad or down in the dumps, I mean people who have dealt with constant suicidal ideation can give me advice on how they have gotten through it and found the will to live I will be eternally grateful.

I wish I was never born.,"   I want to kill myself. I can't bring myself to tell anyone, I promised my dad I wouldn't. I have chronic depression and severe anxiety and I'm too scared to ask anyone for help. I'm too pathetic to kill myself anyways. 

   Im a failure to my family and anyone who's helped me. I don't know how to ask for help. Everyday I have the chance to help myself, get back into school but I stay home because I'm too pathetic and selfish to see that people are wanting to help me. I've wasted many years of their life. I want it to end but I know they'd think it was their fault. I'd only ruin their life more. 

   I've written so many journals full of things I can't tell people. When I don't tell them, I feel so alone, they seem like strangers. Im losing my friends because I just can't express emotions. I feel like an empty husk.

   How do I tell these people that care about me and worked so hard to help me that it isn't working. My father's about to give up on me. My parents almost split because of me. My dad always blames himself for my problems. I don't want him to suffer anymore.

"Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends.","I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...

I just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Can't really say I'm sad or depressed but being so fucking drained and exhausted every single day makes me want to die already,"Im 17 and currently at middle school, specifically grade 10. Lately my daily activities are just so repetitively boring and exhausting. I wake up, take a bath, eat breakfast, attend class, eat lunch, attend class, sleep until dinner time, eat dinner, complete homeworks and other school requirements, sleep. I rarely find time to entertain myself and if ever I do, I sleep or play mobile/computer games but I can't enjoy playing as much as I did before. Sometimes, when there are no school works for the night, I always think to myself why I am just playing and not doing a school work, even if there is absolutely no school work to do. The workload that the school is giving  really feels unreasonable. Whenever I'm doing a school work, I always wish that I can skip to having a family and a stable job and skip these fucking integrals and dipshit shakespeare. But then it's impossible to skip it so I have experience at least five more years of agony. I wanted to consider having to leave school for a year or even completely stop going to school but it's a big no no because of my family's expectations. And if ever I explain my situation to them, they will probably just dismiss it and force me to finish school. So now the option I'm thinking of is to end everything by killing myself.

What I felt was comfort. It felt like this made sense and I was finally ready to go. It just felt right to be in this position. I could have easily pulled the trigger there and been done with it. Instead, I waited to see if I had a chance to get the love of my life back. While she was away, she told me things such as “I’m not giving up on you” and “I love you”. I really thought we were going to make it through this. Today, she ended it for good and moved all of her belongings out of my house while I was at work.

Of course nothing happened, I was a child. But it's come back now. I'm a young adult, with a job, friends, a side gig doing what I enjoy and access to a lovely community...but it honestly all feels wrong.

I've gone through multiple kinds of meds, currently on Wellbutrin, been in therapy (and im trying to get in again but I can't afford the expensive kind and the kind im looking into is AWFUL at returning phone calls) etc... everything seems like such a big hassle. 

I've debated for a long time posting in here- I just feel like I have nothing left to try. The only thing stopping me is the guilt I feel if I do this. My mother is a single parent, she would be devastated. But she doesn't know whats going on. I've never been comfortable talking to her about this. She didn't know about my self harming in high school (i relapsed semi-recently too) and we've still never discussed it. 

My best friend lost someone to suicide recently, so I can't bear to bring this to her...  and everyone else has something else going on. I feel like I have no one to truly confide in. 

It's hard-  but please- can someone give me ideas as to how to stop the thoughts?

Going straight to the point, I think about killing myself since 2018, that year my grandfather discovered he had an incurable genetic disease, something I never imagined, my parents are separated, so he was like a father to me, besides he being the  person with whom I spent the most of my time, continuing, after he discovered this disease he spent the whole year in hospital, when he was discharged he returned to my house, but he only spent about three days until he returned to the hospital, with the disease progressing he started to lose weight to the point of weighing almost twice as little as I, who am already thin, in addition to the progress of the disease he developed depression, normally I often visited him, but from time to time he didn't have enough energy even to  greet me. 

On November 11 he had an internal hemorrhage, that same day I went to visit him, my mother did not warn me of anything, when I arrived he was bleeding a lot, but he did not know, he was very happy because of  strong antidepressants that he was taking, but he felt pain, even after taking morphine, seeing someone I loved very much dying in front of me and being unable to do anything was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, he died on 13  November at 6:50 am.


That same year I started having suicidal thoughts, I spent most of the time alone, since my mom and grandma were always in the hospital, my mom was much stressed and often told me that I was just born to disturb her, that i was no good for anything and things like that, over time I started to isolate myself at school and become an introvert, I talked almost every day with CVV (Similar to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in my country) because I felt very lonely, but no matter how much time passed, suicidal toughts only increased. That same year I took the exam to enter a school that is considered the best in my state believing that i would be better. 

In 2019 I went to the school that I took the exam, but due to my introvert even with a month of classes I still didn't have any friends, I ate lunch alone and came home alone, in that period I almost tried to commit suicide, but luckily I managed to make some friends. On the other hand, the school's teaching is horrible, and I can't learn almost anything, I usually got good grades, but at this school I get horrible math grades, which makes me feel like a crap, in addition to the school being very tiring in general.

That same year I started to like someone, the second time it occurred to me, but the person I liked already liked someone, the problem is that I started to compare myself with the crush of the person that I liked, which decreases even more my self-esteem, over time I started to compare myself with anyone, always coming to the conclusion that I suck, only increasing my suicidal toughts.  I talked to my mother about my suicidal thoughts, she said that I would start going to the psychologist earlier this year, but until now she apparently forgot, which shows how important I am to her. 

I don't have a hobby, I can't like almost anything i do, I hate waking up early to go to a place that suck, my self-esteem is only getting worse, I can't take pictures of myself for 2 years because every time that I see myself I realize how ugly I am, I have no more plans, I hate myself so much, I hate my appearance, voice, personality, everything that i'm, if I kill myself I will not be missed by anyone, I am replaceable in all areas of my life, my friends only talk to me because I often do jokes and my mom just pretends to care about me because she doesn't want the money she spent on me to be in vain. 

No matter how long I wait, things just get worse and worse. It's been three days since I have slept 4 hours because I am very anxious, I just want to end the bad joke that is my life, nothing is going to change, nothing is going to get better, I have no reason to continue supporting it every day. 

Every day I take the subway to go to my school, and every day I think that jumping there would not be a bad idea, I don't know what to do, I think it will just happen, anyway that don't makes a difference to anyone...",t2_177ld2cn,11,0
The letter,"I just wrote my second suicide letter. This one was written differently than the first. And i like it better. Is deep, it tells my story like im bleeding it. Its raw, because i want people to understand me and feel my pain and know my story and what lead me to feel this way. There are alot of factors, and noe i have them all down. The other letter wasnt focused too much on me, it was more of me telling people im sorry and take care of each other. But i decided that the last thing they read from me is gonna be all about me and why i was the way i was.

Anyway ive posted too many times here today. Im just having that type of day, and this is my venting place, i dont have anyone i can vent to. And while the letter was a vent in its self, i wanted to tell someone what i just did.

I don't deserve to live,"Honestly I deserve to be depressed. I deserve nothing more than a slow and painful death. All I've done in life is harm others and ruin my friend's lives by complaining about my dumb problems and getting wrapped up in my own toxic personality.  I've only created suffering, and never helped anyone. Half the people I know would love to see me dead at this point, and I can't blame them.

And I've read so many of the posts of people on here who talk about the various terrible things that have happened to them in life like breakups, abuse, and death. And here I am just being a toxic loser sitting in my room at midnight complaining about my cushy middle class teenager life. All of my issues literally stem from me being an asshole, and not any external suffering caused in my life.

[SERIOUS] how did you feel after failed suicide attempt," 

Hear me out, I know this might sound like a troll post but please let me get my story out and I hope to get feedback from this.

I just got out of the VA hospital for a 5 day stay in the mental health ward. They were really good people and I can not say enough praise about them but I have to lead everyone up to the point on which they were able to help me.

Before the cause of my stay in the hospital I honestly thought that people who self harmed was just people looking for attention or that maybe had some kind of fetish. I do my best not to judge people based on just one insight I have of the person but to be honest I've only knew a few in my life, a total of two to be honest and from knowing them in the aspects that they showed to the world I deemed them ""attention whores"" and never thought about it much ever since.

Last week I tried to take my life. The reasons honestly doesn't matter it could be ptsd, general life related or just simple lack of sleep.

I had my plan together, wife was at work, only mother-in-law was home and upstairs, I placed my dogs in my room and I was going to go into the back yard with a glock 38 .45 acp. I called 911 and informed them that they would have a body to pick up at this address and where it would be located. The Operator tried the normal stuff such as think of your family and friends and how much you would be hurting them with some other stuff but I was half way listening to be honest because my goal was to bed dead and the cops take my body before my wife and step kids got home.

so I laid down in the backyard next to the pool and fire pit I had put in years back, my left arm laid in dog shit and I just groaned to my self ""this isn't what I want to leave behind"". I wiped off the dog shit the best I could so at least it wouldn't be obvious to the first person that found my body that I willingly/mistakenly laid it in. I hear rambles on my smart phone not sure what she was saying but I'm guessing she was going through a checklist and then I brought the pistol up to my head.

I took a big deep breath and well you know the outcome I couldn't pull the trigger. I a man that has spent literally years in Iraq being shot and bombed against could not pull the fucking trigger....

The amount I hatred I felt for myself and for life as a whole will never be done in that moment. ""You had 1 fucking job and you couldn't do it"" ""you pile of shit, gutless little faggot that always cried out for a way out but when it came you didn't have the balls"". Words honestly can not do justice to the emotions I felt at the time. I already give the 911 operator my info so I knew I only had limited time to finish what I started.

I did not have a back up plan when I started this because I honestly thought I could take the shot. my mind jumped to slitting my wrist in all the Hollywood cliches movies I've seen in the past. I ran into my kitchen. my heart is pounding because I know I'm on a timer, the cops are coming and I need to be dead before they get here but I need to die outside. I grabbed a hand full of knifes that was in the butcher block thingie not sure what its called but it held 8 of them and came out with 3. I started cutting my left wrist with the biggest which I thought would be the sharpest and it just tore the skin. ""shit its dull"" then I grabbed the next one and rub my thumb across its blade in a right to left motion. It was also dull as well as the third.

So here I am dog shit on 1/2 of my left arm a pistol with 1 round in it in front of me and 3 different kinds of knifes around me while cops are coming...

yea fuck that, I knew I had a sharp or at least what I thought was sharp leatherman type knife I had from a while back in my den. I ran in, grabbed it and went back to the spot I picked to die \*not sure why I picked this spot it just seemed like a nice place to die but I digress\*. I started slicing at my left wrist, the first time I have ever cut my self on purpose in my life and the knife was not as sharp as I thought it was so I kept slicing and it would dig in then jump to another spot repeatedly but at least it was sharper than knifes in the kitchen. The 911 operator is still on my smart phone and I cant hear a word she is saying but I do remember saying ""there we go"" when I first start seeing beads then what I thought was an artery of blood sprint forth my arm \*14 1/2 inches according to the nice people at the va and just kept repeatedly slicing.

Now during this time I thought I was done for so I was just going for style points and just to be sure. So I kept slicing and wincing at the pain when the knife jumped to another spot over and over again but with all the blood it was really hard to see what was being done and I just kept repeating the motion over and over again until I heard someone from my back right say my name and to drop the weapon. I do remember telling the officer that I'm not done yet. He yells at me again to drop the weapon and at this point I figure that I would listen to him because I'm already dead right? I've got my left arm covered with blood that has been stabbed and torn and sliced over 20 times no way I'm making my way out of this. I throw the knife down a good 5 feet from me and place my hand above my head as I was instructed I remember blood hitting my bald spot as I did this and was like ""yea, going to die in peace on a stretcher somewhere and not on grass with dog shit on it"". The Officer ask if I have any other weapons, I tell him I have a pistol with 1 round on it in front me. he ask that I stand up and by no means lean towards the pistol \*I have nothing but respect for cops I know they are like people and some fuck up and there are good and bad ones but I'm not the type of shitlord that tries to make things hard for them\* so I do what I'm told. The officer comes in front of me with a tact vest of some sort mostlikey running interceptor body armor \*that shit is a joke\* and an ar15 type rifle not sure if it was a sigg but he had his kit fully ready.

The officer reaches for the pistol thats around 2 foot in front of where I was squatting on the deck. he takes the pistol and throws it to the side. He had sunglasses on but if I was him I sure as hell wouldnt of taken an eye off of me. he ask if I had anymore weapon I tell him no. He then tells me to stand up and turn my back towards him which I do. He then ask me to lift up my shirt which I'm guessing is to make sure I didn't have any hidden weapons on me and at this point another officer appears in front of me. I dont know when he got there or how but I didn't notice until it already happened.

The 2nd officer checked my waistband again for something that might be hidden and tells me to keep my arms up. at this point my left arm is covered in blood and its just dripping all over the stone decking. I'm waiting for the whole pass out and never wake up thingie to happen but since you've read this far you know that didn't happen. After both officers checked me they called in emts which got to work on my arm and in my mine I thought ""haha faggots ya too late, too slow on the draw /muahahhaha I win"".

The EMTs starts cleaning off the blood and for the first time I can honestly see the real damage I did and let me be everything but misunderstood here ""I was fucking ferrous"". My entire arm that was covered in blood and I thought I was done for was just a shit load of nicks and scratches. 20 or 30 times I carved with the knife it was just jumping from 1 point to another very few places did it have what I would even call a decent cut.

So after the EMTs clear me the 2nd officer is talking with me and me being the big bitch I am had been crying the entire time in hopes that the cutting would put and end of my life/suffering. The 2nd officer tried doing the whole ""what about you friends and family"" speech bullshit which before then I thought was just a trope so I told him I'm a selfish asshole and I just want this one thing.

we go back and forth not sure for how long, maybe 15 mins \*I'm not the best judge of time\* before I'm handcuffed and put in back of a squad car then moved to another one because its 1 guys launch break \*this is true a fuck and in the moment I'm like yea ok let the guy get some food because everyone hates working on there lunch break\* so I'm moved into the other car and we make the way to the largest VA hospital in my area. The reason we are going to the VA is because they have seen me before on thoughts of suicide but this was the first time I've taken action. \*if your asking why a guy who had seen the doc about suicide stuff still have a weapon, its simple really. I locked it in a quick release safe that only my wife has/had the code to. it took me 5 mins with a flat head screw driver to open it so keep that in mind if you have a quick release safe because of kids\* I get to the hospital which took around an hour and the entire time cop number two was talking to me. IMO he is a good guy, not he's a cop so he's a good guy but he honestly seemed to care about what was going on.

I'm in the va hospital, cop number 2 talks to another cop there and says I'm non combative would he like for me to stay in restrains or not. cop number 3 says nah take'm off. so there I am, pissed at the entire world and myself most of all in a lil room with glass doors with a small Hispanic nurse next to me and the 3rd officer keeping and eye on me in the distance.

I spent 5 days in the metal ward of the va hospital which help'ed me get thing back on track but because of all of this I think I like cutting myself now and I do not know what to do about any of this.

TLDR: Failed suicide ends up finding out he likes being cut.",t2_5wielnmg,1,0

Don’t know what to do,"So, I’m new to this. First time posting on Reddit or anywhere. I’ve talked with people in the past, no real help. 

From anyone’s perspective, I have a good life. Wife, kids, good career, healthy family. Literally nothing to complain about. Most anyone would say I’m lucky, and I am for the most part. I’m an ass for complaining. 

Despite all that, I wish I was dead. Every day. All the time. I don’t have the courage to kill myself. It would devastate so many people around me. The logical part of me knows it isn’t true, but my gut tells me they’d all be better off without me here, even if they don’t know it. I give no value to anything. There’s nothing I really can contribute. 

I’m 38, and I’ve felt this way for as long as I can remember. I can’t connect with people.  Not really. I don’t have any legit friends, just people who kinda know me. I’m incapable of making emotional connections. 

I have nobody to talk with about this. I don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish by posting this. I’m just lost and have nowhere to go. I just want to not be here anymore, for it all to just go away, like I never existed. This keeps getting worse, and I know nothing will fix who I am.

It's been a brutal 2020,"I left my job in July of last year. A very good job, my career. My depression got to be too much to put up with living where I was. I had a plan in place when I made this decision, but it fell through. Despite this, I was able to pay all of my bills through living frugally and with my savings I accrued over the few years I had been making good money, which was enough to get me to this point. I have been applying for jobs all over the place and because I've wrecked my credit so bad from paying rent on it to get by once savings ran low, I can't even rent a car through Uber to drive for them. I'm ten days past due on rent and my landlord is hounding me everyday, I don't blame him. I turn 33 in a week and I am a failure. I am never happy, every time I think I'm taking a step forward I end up taking two steps back. I know a lot of people in this world have it worse than me and I feel like a piece of shit every day that I can't pull myself out of this rut.

I am sorry for letting you all down. I just can't do it anymore. Depression is a real son of a bitch. I wish I had insurance so I could get help. But I just can't take it anymore. The walls are closing in and I've exhausted all of my options. I tried. I really did. Sometimes some people just don't matter and slip through the cracks. I wish I wasn't one of them, but I know that I was fortunate to have a chance in the past. Some people don't even get that much. I just don't get it. I'm not a felon, I've never even been arrested. I have military experience and an honorable discharge. I've been working since I was 16 and have never been fired. I'm sorry.

the first time i remember was when i was 13 and saw a kid from my school run over by a car and i wished it was me. 
then until like 18 i was in my teen angst emo phase and wrote poetry about death. that time everytime i crossed a street i imagined to just stop and be run over or if i was in plane i wished there was an accident and stuff like that. after that i went to study abroad and the thoughts went away and i thought i overcame everything. 

however, now im 26 and am right back. 
i wish i was dead not everyday but like three times a week. i don't wanna kill myself, because i don't wanna be a burden on my husband and his family. like i don't want them to have to clean after me or think they did something wrong. i just pray thst i will die. 
i thought that maybe drowning in the ocean near my house would be ideal. no cleaning after and it could look like an accident. i don't want to be a burden after i die, so an accident would be great, so noone thinks they did something wrong. 
to why i feel like that.
  i just think that i am not contributing to anyones life. like i am a waste of a life or just a burden. without me here everyone would have an easier and happier life. 
 i believe in reincarnation and pray everyday to be a tree in ny next life so i can be useful and give humans oxygen or become someones favorite chair or something. just be useful without harming anyone...

But today, I started thinking of the other what ifs. What if the hurt of me finally dying is better than the burden of loving me and taking care of me for God knows until when? What if it’s better to rip it off suddenly than slowly take it off?

I can’t bear the thought of growing old alone. Or worse growing old still under the care of my family. Was that my main purpose of being here on earth? To be a burden? To be alone? To feel pain every fucking day?

Help,"Can anyone help. I've lost all motivation to live and I dont know what to do, about 45 minutes ago I almost walked into the kitchen and grabbed the chef's knife and I dont know where else to turn I have no one to talk to, my family isnt an option,maybe I just need to talk to someone idk but I need help. How do I stop the ever present voice telling me my life isnt worth living I tried so hard.

Maybe it's because I believe it, the only thing I have to live for is my cats and mom, and hate everything and everyone else including me. My grades are getting increasingly worse my dad is managing to mentally torment me by being ever present in my thoughts, I feel like I have no freedom, videogames arent fun anymore i have nothing that i really look forward too the only things i enjoy i cant do freely I'm trapped in a school system that has failed me miserably, a family system I hate, and a world I dont agree with.

I constantly see myself praying for god to end me and then coming to the conclusion that there is no god, how could a true god put people through such torture? How could he destroy people's minds to the point of them literally killing themselves? I've looked for a little while on how to stop my misery but the only sources that came close to answering me said that it lasts forever and implied that everything else is a distraction from it, I cant have this for the rest of my life if I'm going to live it, I'm only 15 how am I supposed go go on another expected 65 years with this torment?

I'm the daughter of a whore and a deadbeat. if i go on i'll ruin my aunt too,"My mother is a great woman... to everyone except me. she hit me and called me a pig. she insulted me to the point where i felt nothing but self hatred. she never believed me when i said i was depressed, years later i've been diagnosed and prescribed or it.

Mother would sleep with random men in the room next to me. i remember hearing it so clearly. i remember grabbing my pencil sharpener and unscrewed the blade.
that was my second suicide attempt. i was 11

She told me i was jealous of her that i'd never be in love. she told me this at 12 because a asked her to stop sleeping with my friends dad. he was married. 

my mother pulled on my hair so hard that i no longer have feeling in my scalp. 

My dad has 9 kids. i am the 5th. when i moved to his house in 2019 i had never met him before. 

he had to work constantly to pay off child support. i never really saw him.

i moved to my aunts this summer. she and her husband where amazing at first. but i began to let my true self creep through.

my entire family here are introverted. i'm extroverted. they get stressed when i'm around. not to mention i'm a drag money wise. 

no matter where i go i cause problems. 

this is why i'm going to kill myself. 

i need to help the people around me by ending my horrible existence.

Arrested for drinking in public with the intention of killing myself. Desperate for advice,"I was told to come to this subreddit as you guys might have the information or resources to help me out.

I got arrested for being drunk in public last night. I was using the alcohol as liquid courage as I had intended to jump off a freeway overpass last night.

I keep changing my life around running from my mind and it feels like it can only end one way,"I've never had a job for a year, not that I've ever been fired, just that my mind starts exploding after a couple months of working somewhere, like a couple months feels like eons. I'm twenty, been working since about 16 and have worked 7 different jobs, the longest for 9 months. Just feels like time is flying by and crawling at the same time, I have my whole life ahead of my but that feels too large, so difficult, I don't know. I just left a good paying job (starting $20 an hour) at a fortune 100 company, great room for growth, 5 minutes from home where I lived for free with parents. Had a girlfriend there, gym membership, good group of friends, good (for the most part) family life. Then I just melted down and now I'm in LA at a friend's place, bought a bike and planned on riding across the country for awhile camping because I was literally losing my mind in the stability. I worked in a call center doing IT and going in felt like my soul was being sucked out literally, I would have full body convulsions in mental agony at the place, no joke. Now I'm here and I just feel stupid, I'm not exactly upset I left such a good situation behind, (for context I was living in New England, so I'm across the country now) I don't have a real plan. Another friend here said he would get a place with me here but am I just going to get stuck in more jobs I hate and eventually leave? I don't know what I like. I try so many things and I always burn out of them so quick. I can't hold down a decent hobby. Guess my only really favorite thing to do motorcycling, or anything dangerous. I feel like this is because I like feeling close to death. Cliche but it's the only time I feel alive at all, other times I just feel like I'm floating through dead space worthless. I'm also hopelessly addicted to porn, would sometimes tell gf that I wasn't into it tonight so I could wait for her to fall asleep and then go masturbate to porn in the bathroom. Sad. People get the impression I'm really smart and do cool things which idk, I guess I do but never feel fulfilled. Just feels like this can't go on for decades, it has to end? I'm so obsessed with more, more sex, more money, more experiences, more adrenaline, more friends, more followers, to the point where I can't feel fully alive for anything. FUCK!!!!!!

Did anybody else experience this because I don't know what to do anymore and nothing helps,"Tl;dr: I nearly died and think I did and don't know what to do.

So last summer I was doing pretty good. I was clean and sorta sober for a few weeks and I was not feeling as suicidal for once.
And then I nearly died, which I don't want to get into too much detail about tbh.
The week after, I was convinced that I had actually died. That my live wasn't real. I ignored these feelings but they have become stronger again.

I don't really know how to deal with that because it makes everything I do insignificant since I do not really exist. Maybe none of you exist? There's this one part of my brain that says that I survived but this other part is determined to convince me that I didn't. It's so weird and I am really torn between them.",t2_5t9f1wg4,1,0

But its just hard. I wish it wasnt, i wish i could just pick up a knife and slit my throat and wrist and just bleed out, but boy im scared. Just because of the pain, i dont want it. How can i avoid it? So that i can avoid having more days like this? 
I feel like dying would be the best thing for me cause i cant see myself living a life like everyone around me. Im too weak. And i should at least have had the courage to get the fuck out, but guess what? Im too weak. 
But whatever, im still planning it, and it will happen one way or another, i just need to get my plan down and find a foolproof method to die. After that its adios and i wont miss anyone and no one will miss me.",t2_5hndu5m1,5,0

Actually worthless,"I have been more and more coming to the conclusion that I am useless.  I'm a young adult; around my 20s. I haven't accomplished anything but a basic education. I've worked before in fast food restaurants, but I had to stop due to a health problem. I now can't really work because of this health problem. However, I am doing uni. 

The uni is the only thing going for me. I can't work and I have to see my father and mother, who are both very tired and have physical pains from repetitive work, go out and cover my ass. Me and my fiancee also broke up, because of various problems. I thought that after I went back and focused on what I was doing it would get better. But no. I have noticed my lack of ability in all forms, such as in English, maths, basic knowledge, skills in videogames, music (I play guitar), editing, basically everything.... All the things I like doing don't bring me joy and I suck. I sleep about 14 hours a day and whenever I wake up I just want to die. I just don't feel like life is worth it and I'm definitely not anything that needs to be alive. I can't be bothered to go anywhere anymore and life is on autopilot. Even my friends are calling me out on my lack of abilities on games. I feel tired of being alive. I think that I should put the effort and get better at things and try to continue, but I feel like I can't be bothered. I just don't get joy from it anymore or maybe I'm so sad that it doesn't matter.

When I was a kid I believed that I was going to be good at something. However, that could not be further from the truth. I am so mediocre it's insane. I am a terrible human being also, coward and afraid of everything regarding my future. I just want this all to be over. I don't feel like it will ever get better.

"Feeling low, have thought about ending it","I'm new here and given my username you can tell I want this to be anonymous, I want to be able to get my emotions out there without strings attached.
Recently I went through alot that got me to think about killing myself but there's alot more to my history that really only makes what has happened all the more painful. Hope it isn't a bother, I'm sure others have been through alot more.
I want to be clear but not make this a novel so if anyone is willing to read this and needs/wants clarification I'll try to provide as best as I can: I was molested when I was a little kid, it was a one time incident but it screwed me up royally once I remembered(I had repressed the memory). In addition to that I'm on the higher end of the spectrum, which only made school an absolute shit show. Combine the two, with me remembering at the end of middle school, and suicide had been at the front of my mind for years. I was able to fight it for awhile, eventually made more friends and revealed to some of them what happened with a surprising amount of support. Slowly I was able to put my suicidal thoughts in the backseat of my head and move foward, trying to figure out a career that will allow me to help people(really in anyway, try to make some days brighter for others in a way I didn't for years).
So why am I here?
My friend introduced me to someone else, we'll call them H, H is someone who has been in an abusive home, has substance abuse problems and a huge problem with opening up to people. My friend figured I could help them. To a degree I did-they became more outgoing in regards to being emotionally honest, being more accepting to therapy(something they had been going through but experiencing doubts about)and even went to get help with the substance abuse. We became fast friends.
What recently happened was that someone H knows told them that I had abused someone at a party while in high school. This abuse mentioned is a claim that I sexually assaulted someone by trying to grab them. I didn't. The very thought of abuse of any kind, that especially, makes me sick. H has cut ties with me, someone I came to care about has come to see me as something that I'm not. Something disgusting. With H being someone I care about and having had, I'll admit, helped me by giving me someone who I could help...it got me thinking about ending it all(I'd say how/my idea of how I'd do it but I don't want to risk being explicit)I talked to my best friend today about it, they encouraged me to try my best to move on and seek therapy(my friends have all tried to nudge me towards seeking professional help for years but I've just never gone). My best friend got me through the day but I'm so fucking distraught and while I don't think I'll ultimately go that way...having the suicidal thoughts pop up to the front of my head again is a really bad sign and I don't know how good my judgement will be in the next couple of days. What should I do? How should I cope with this?

Death by small airplane,"Repost for day people. 

So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

She said her friends are trying to keep her away from sharp objects such as knives etc.

Need to rant - my Book analogy,"My phone is at 6% and I have no charger available so I may not reply to this for a while. Not that I think anyone will comment anyways. 

I feel that life is like writing a book. You have chapters in your life, with different antagonists and motives and goals and whatnot at different stages. But no one likes a book where nothing happens. You’re always supposed to be adding something interesting to your book. To your life.

What if you’re tired of writing? What if you realize that you’re not a good writer and your book is an incoherent mess all the way through? What if you want to scrap the book and give it another shot?

Its already going to be a shitty book, it doesn’t need to be a long one. Why not wrap it all up here?",t2_bjr2e,1,0
I want to die.,My brother killed my cat (on accident) and mocked me for crying. I was already down for this month and the death of the one thing i cherished most did not help. I dont know what to do now. I feel emptier than before,t2_5uu6i4lc,2,0
BDD and criticism from strangers,"Everyday I feel like I am knocked down by a comment from someone and I have to try to build myself back up all over again. I have agoraphobia and severe social anxiety. Can't drive anywhere. Being out in public basically causes nonstop panic attack until I am back inside.

I had a bad time at the hairdresser because while getting my haircut a woman there called my hair a herpée - male equivalent of toupee. My hair has for years caused me grief-bullied mercilessly for years about my hair. I depend on hats for security. Present day people still sometimes say awful things about my hair. I spend gruelling amount of effort trying to make it look okay. I've spent so much money on hats and clothes trying to find something that can make me look good enough to be seen in public. I enjoy fashion but am fairly poor and not as good at dressing myself as I'd like to be due to also having ADHD-PI and having difficulty with decisions and being in stores from anxiety and becoming disoriented and overwhelmed in stores. Today is a hard day and I basically was internally panicking, couldn't relax the entire time I was at the hairdresser, then walked home and am still shaking a bit. I'm dying inside.

TLDR; Everyday is hell. I have internal voices telling me I'm ugly AND external voices from strangers. Was insulted at the hairdresser. Not sure how to combat both BDD and people's criticism.",t2_5946t52m,3,0
(HELP) Does my dad have autism? Or a mental disorder? He is abusive and socially inept,"Does my dad have autism? (When my dad was younger, some people would ask my aunt if he had aspergers) Front temporal lobe dementia? Brain damage from a heart attack during heart surgery a decade ago? A Brain Tumor? Chemo brain? What is wrong with him? 

My dad is the most awkward and strangest person to ever live. I wish my dad was dead. I’m a 21 year old female, and My dad (M/60) is the root of my severe treatment resistant depression and severe anxiety. He is physically and verbally abusive, sexist, apathetic, cold, he is EXTREMELY socially awkward and is socially inappropriate, and sometimes acts psychotic. 

(Trigger warnings: suicide) 
Some background: I survived a suicide attempt via drug overdose on my 19th birthday. And I am going to start ketamine infusions this month because all antidepressants have failed me. I live with my mom (F/60) and my sister (F/22) and my dad. I am a freshman in community college (I started late, due to multiple stomach problems, Gastroparesis, Hiatal hernia, Stomach ulcers, esophageal ulcers, GERD, IBS, gallbladder problems/removal, 4 stomach surgeries, probably caused by extreme stress)....I’ve tried to move out 3 times since I was 16. I’ve stayed with a family friend but was rejected by their adult kids who didn’t want me living there, I’ve stayed with my grandma, but she lives extremely far away from my college, and she recently broke her leg and is in a rehabilitation/physical therapy center. I’ve stayed with my aunt, but my stuff was continuously stolen, all of my makeup was stolen, (they had a cleaning lady who came to clean once a week) and I was in a very small storage room that made me depressed. And my aunt says now is not a good time for me to be living there Because of her personal issues. So I’m stuck at home for now. I’m on disability for my Depression and paralyzed stomach, but I want to get a job this summer, hopefully I’ll be more mentally stable by then.....I love art, music, and dancing, but I am way too depressed and unmotivated lately to create anything. I am failing some of my college classes....


My dad is the most severely awkward person I’ve ever known. I bet my mom only married him because his parents had some money. He can’t form sentences properly, he has an awkward walking gait (he is hunched over and his neck will lean forward and bob up and down, has little arm swing movement, his hands are always in fists, and his feet drag and hit the ground loudly. Even hearing him walk gives me anxiety), he will only talk about his interests, uses awkward hand gestures to describe things that don’t match what he’s saying, He has an EXTREMELY loud voice, and he will interrupt people constantly while they're talking mid-sentence. He doesn’t even make eye contact with me when I try to talk to him, he will just say “uh-huh” or “oh” to everything I say. Recently I shared my dance video with him (I take dance classes) and his reaction was an indifferent “Oh.” But when I make a small mistake he will have a paragraph to say to me. One time I accidentally clogged the toilet at 2 am and the next morning there was some water on the ground. I cleaned it up, and my dad yelled at me and said I’m irresponsible, inconsiderate, that I don’t care about people (Lol what?). He makes inappropriate facial expressions at random times. He will make a painful cringe face anywhere for no reason, at a restaurant, etc. I asked him why is he making that face and he accused me of insulting him. He can’t speak properly. He recently asked me “D-Do ya think over-over proportion coronavirus?” And I think he was trying to ask “Do you think the coronavirus is blown out of proportion?” He also repeats words in every sentence. His new favorite word is “Basically.” Basically this happened and basically she basically did that, which happened basically” is all I hear. He takes HUGE bites of food and overly stuffs his mouth when eating. He’ll make random grunting noises for no reason, when he’s walking to the living or randomly. Sometimes I think he “stims” He will rub his hands together very fast for a few seconds. I’ve tried to get him to see a doctor, I’ve tried to get my mom to get him to see a doctor, but nothing is happening...I think the next part is probably one of the most socially inappropriate things he’s ever done


Last year I was helping my musician friend film a music video and my dad drove me and my sister to help. Her family and friends were there and it was great, we had a normal calm conversation about camera work, and then, out of fucking nowhere, my dad starting excitedly yelling unintelligibly and moving his hands erratically. He seemed to be very excited about something for no reason. He said “ITHHFKSBBF FUEHRBD WKSJDBR EJDJRJF!!!” All while smiling and moving his hands back and forth towards his face quickly. And then he put his hands in his pockets and thrusted his hips forward and did a dance and stuck his tongue out. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK. 

My friends and her family ignored him because they thought he was a homeless guy on drugs at first!!! He went up to her mom and tried talking to her but she ignored him (as she should). I know he doesn’t take drugs, I know him, and I was with him all day. I was too embarrassed to say he was my dad. And he waited outside in the car while we filmed inside. There have been several other instances of him doing weird shit like this, and I’ll look down in shame. I used to cry about it as a teenager. I never have any friends over. I’m introverted and have social anxiety, and I’d like to invite friends over, but I don’t want them to meet my dad or have my dad pull shit. 

He doesn’t have any close friends, his mom and sister cut ties with him, his nieces hate him his brother in law hates him, everyone hates him. and he only talks to random strangers about sports. That is literally ALL he ever talks about to people outside his family. Always sports. Nothing else. He can’t learn basic things like changing the tv signal from HDMI to the DVD player, he will get pissed if I don’t change the tv for him. He can’t learn the basics of playing a board game and he lashed out and screamed because he didn’t understand, and I was 15 at the time. He is extremely scarily obsessed with saving money, he never buys me or anyone birthday gifts or Christmas gifts. He doesn’t heat or cool the house, he digs in public trash cans to find bottles and cans to recycle them for a few bucks. When I was younger we’d go to subway to share a 5 dollar foot long, and he’d complain to the cashier “That’s expensive!” As if the cashier would lower the price just for him. One time I was at a restaurant and my dad bought a kids meal for me. I was 19 at the time. I’ll elaborate more on his extreme cheapness. He doesn’t care about anyone. 

My dad has abused me over the smallest things. He physically and verbally abused me when I was a teenager. He isn’t abusive anymore, but I have extreme anxiety around him, and he lives at home and is unemployed. Even when I’m not at home or around him, I am extremely anxious. I have constant intrusive thoughts about how much I hate him and I am seeing a therapist and we are working on skills to help me tolerate my dad. But it’s not working. I’ve tried EMDR therapy, TMS therapy. So I am looking for a new therapist and possibly DBT therapy so I’m not so sensitive about him. He is unemployed And has been for 10
Years because he has Basal Cell Carcinoma (undeadly, just annoying skin cancer), and takes chemo drugs. Also more than a decade ago he had a mechanical heart valve replacement and he had a heart attack during surgery. Maybe it damaged his brain, and that’s why he acts the way he does? I know he’s probably mentally sick but at this point I have no sympathy for him. He abused me over the dumbest things. Like I mentioned, he is obsessed with saving money. He never heats or cools the house (California summers are hell) and when he caught me turning the AC on he screamed in my face “I’m the boss of you, you fucking bitch!” Another time when I was 14, he punched me in the face because I was crying from worrying about a test. He’d push me, kick me, pin me to a wall, He’s called me ugly, fat, stupid, worthless, crazy, mentally ill, fucked up, bitch, etc. a year ago I asked him why he calls me a bitch. He said in a mean tone “Because you have mennal illness.” (He says “mental” like “mennal”). He also calls my mom and sister a bitch, and he has sexist rants about “Why are three females dominating me? Back then men were in charge!” And he says “But I’m the man of the house!” My mom ignores me whenever I tell her that he abused me. I think she’s afraid of divorce and losing money or maybe she’s afraid of being alone even though this fucker makes me want to end myself. Trust me, I’ve tried talking to her about it. She told me he wasn’t always like this...so does that rule out The autism diagnosis?

I had an eating disorder at 14, was very underweight, and I didn’t have a period for a year. Years later when I gained weight and became healthier (5”4, 125 lbs) He encouraged me to lose weight. He said “Don’t you wanna be like that? Not having a period?” He’s dumb.

On my 10th birthday when my mom bought me an American Girl Doll (costs about 100+ dollars) he was in his room, saw the receipt, and literally screamed at the top of his lungs for a good 30 minutes. And I mean SCREAMING. just unintelligible demonic yelling. I had been obsessed with American girl for years before my mom got me that doll. I was always playing with my friends dolls and looking through the AG catalog. It was supposed to be a special gift and he ruined it. I never played with that doll because of that. He obsessively checks everyone’s receipts. He has had public freakouts over items being “too expensive.” When I was 12 I wanted to see a movie with my friend and her parents, and my dad freaked the fuck out because of the “expensive movie tickets” and stayed and waited in the car the whole time. Another time when I was 10 he rented a movie for one dollar and if you lose the film you have to pay 8 dollars for the film. So one time my friend was over and my sister accidentally misplaced the movie and he screamed and cursed at her “you better fucking find it!” My friend asked me “what is wrong with your dad?” 

Gross: he never flushes the toilet or washes his hands to “save money.” He is disgusting. And he only takes showers at the gym. 

I guess a pro about him is that he has a strict daily routine and wakes up at 4 am every morning to exercise (damn I wish I had that motivation, I probably would if he wasn’t in my life). And then he spends most of the day cleaning. But if anyone interrupts his routine he flips out. When I was 13 I made an art piece of a portrait of a girl and I guess I made the forehead too big because he mocked it and said “ET, ET.” His responses are short and stupid. 

He also exhibits sexually inappropriate behavior. One time when I was 16 and having dinner with my mom and sister, my dad was a few feet away from us and while he was making a sandwich he vigorously humped the kitchen counter, and my sister noticed and said in an irritated voice, “Papa what are you doing why are you humping the counter that’s gross.” And he just kept going and he said in a defensive voice “I’M DANCEN!” (I’m dancing) And just kept going. And my mom said “No, stop.”


(Trigger warning? Possible child abuse?) To preface this next part, I don’t know what the hell happened in this situation, but when I told a therapist about it she called a social worker to come to the house. When I was a 4 year old He used to walk around the house in his tidy whities a lot, and he’d play this game called “the scissors” and he’d put me between his legs and close them tightly so I couldn’t escape and I yelled for my mom and she would just tell him to stop without questioning wtf was going on. 
He knew I hated it but he kept doing that stupid “scissors” game. Idk wtf that was.

I know most people will say I’m an adult, I should get a job now and save up and move out. Trust me I wanna do that, depression is kicking my ass lately. I can barely function and do my homework. I hope medical ketamine will have effect on my depression. I am trying to eat healthy and exercise. I am also trying to work on college apps, I want to go to an art school and stay in the dorms. Hopefully I’ll get accepted to an art school. My friend’s family has roommates, and maybe I’ll ask if I can rent a room (I’ll have to share a tiny bedroom with 3 other people but maybe that’s worth it to be away from my dad) There are many things I can do about the stress of the situation. I just want to know what the hell is wrong with him. Life would be so much easier if he was dead. I hope he has a brain tumor. Ngl, I’m not that religious or anything, but every day I pray that he will die today. We have life insurance, I won’t be on edge anymore and I’d honestly be much better mentally and physically. I know, I’m an asshole. Please, answer away. Thank you...",t2_5wbw71je,5,0
I'm so done with life,"My life is going in circles, I feel like the ""good times"" I get are so scarce lately. I go jumping from one bad moment to another, and the bad moments get worse every time, while the good get worse too instead of better.

I'm tired of having to use so much energy just to get out of bed, and I'm tired of never being able to sleep even though I haven't slept for 4 days.

I'm tired of making excuses for those who care about me, they deserve way better.

I'm tired of feeling worthless, I want to feel like other people feel about themselves.

I want to enjoy things without alcohol or drugs again, I'm tired of spending so much money on 2 hours of ""good numbness"" (if that makes sense).

Worthless. Unwanted. Unattractive. Not good enough. Not worth saving.,"I got into an argument with my husband the other day.  I was so mad I wanted to hit him.  Instead I grabbed a plastic fork and ran the tines over my arm.  He said he didn't like to see me hurt, but only made a half ass effort to stop me.  I told him to stay back and ran the fork over my arm again and again.  Then asked why he didn't stop me and he said because I told him to stay back.

I know I did, but at the same time I wanted to see if he cared enough to stop me regardless of what I said.  I didn't voice this to him, but now I know for a fact that he doesn't care about me.

He told me he's not attracted to me because of my weight and the fact that I'm plain.  But, when he was looking at porn he admitted he jacked off to women who were of the same height and weight. The difference was I was real, they weren't.

He told me he doesn't want to deal with my depression and anxiety, especially if he knows he might be contributing to it.  But, he's willing to engage with me when I'm happy and laughing, especially when he thinks he might be contributing to it.  And here I thought love in a marriage was supposed to be unconditional, through thick and thin.  Guess not.

I called him out on the fact I think he no longer loves me, as I no longer see it in his eyes, face, or hear it in his voice like I used to.  He has since stopped saying, ""I love you"".

And, this is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg.

I think I might have testicular cancer fml,"Yep, one of my testicles is larger than the other and it has been for a year at most.
Got a little hard bump (assumed that it was a cyst) near the testicle, its getting bigger at a faster rate now.
I think I've got testicular cancer, even though I am exasperated I'm going to the doctors tomorrow (have not got an appointment arranged). I am starting to give up, I have type 1 diabetes and autism so of course I'm going to be one of those people who goes through one health problem to the next until I die a nasty death, fuck that.
Before I was diagnosed with diabetes and got ill I wondered if I had diabetes voiced my concerns and people said I was fine, I wasn't.
Same things happening with my testicle, I am now wondering and nobody believes me. A cancer diagnosis is only an ultrasound test away. 

I'm so sick of this, and from now on I will think about killing myself until I actually do it. I know that testicular cancer has high survival rates but I'm inclined to think that once you get cancer your very likely to get it again. Fuck that shit, all I wanted was a peaceful life, not a life where I have to worry and check for any strange bumps inside of my asshole just to live for a little while longer. 

So yeah, I need to take control of my situation and give my defective body what it deserves, complete destruction because if a computer is fucking up like my body is then I'm probably gonna smash it to pieces too.

I need someone to talk to,"(English is not my first language)I always had suicidal thoughts since i was around 12. I dont even remember and i dont even know why. When i was 13-14 i was in love with a girl who always thought of me as a friend. So a wanted to kill myself of course (i was really dumb back then) then i had my first gf at 16 and life was amazing, i felt loved and important. I had a lot of friends back then. We agreed to break up in january(after 1.5 year), but we were still seeing each other as friends with benefits until last saturday. Basically what she did to me: she fucked me over around 5 times. One day she said she loves me and the next day she doesnt. And this kept going on i was confused, i couldnt sleep (i still cant) my grades are terrible, at the moment im failing 3 classes bc i cant concentrate. Now we got to the  point where she said that lets be just friends. She wants to move on. I just cant. I have lost a lot of friends there is only one person who i can turn to. I still have friends but they are not really friends who u want to discuss your suicidal thoughts with. I downloaded tinder although i have a lot of likes and matches 3 girls ghosted me and it made me feel unwanted. So basically matches and likes dont mean anything.

I give up,"I’m done, I give up. I thought I may be tough enough for this life but I’m not. Each day feels like an eternity in hell, I’m suffering every single day I can’t take it anymore. Honestly I was stupid to ever think I even had a chance to be able to push through to the end. People say it gets better, but for me I honestly don’t think it will, I don’t even know why I’m still alive if all I’m doing is suffering. 

I doubt my life would end like this if I’d been born into a different situation, but I guess that would go without saying for pretty much any suicidal person. Looking back on my life I think my life was always destined to end this way, but I shouldn’t just blame my situation for this, honestly I’m the one at fault too. I’m pathetic, I’m the one who can’t overcome myself or my situation, honestly I probably couldn’t handle a normal life either, I’m just too unmotivated to do anything about my life, and I don’t want to blame that on anyone or anything else other than myself. 

Honestly this might not even be the end, in fact it probably isn’t. I’m probably going to come back to Reddit tomorrow and start posting again just like usual, this has happened a lot of times in the past. I’ve gotten really upset, I tell myself this is going to be the end, then either something happens that makes me feel better or it actually comes down to ending my life and I just can’t bring myself to do it, which just makes myself feel shitty as I keep telling myself I’m faking it and that I’ve made up all my struggles in my head. 

I dunno, maybe I’ll live maybe I won’t, either way I don’t think it’ll affect much, and honestly even if I do end up staying alive I think I still need a break from Reddit, the site’s been really helpful in some areas but has also played a part in my own self hatred, I think I need a break from it anyway, maybe a few days I dunno. God, now I’m acting as if I’m not going to end up actually ending my life. I dunno. Like I said before, maybe I’ll live maybe I won’t, but to be honest I’m feeling a little better after writing this so maybe I won’t, I dunno. But the more I think about it the more I feel like suicide would probably be the best option in my situation, it's not as if my life's going to change anytime soon and I doubt I'll ever actually be happy with my life. I’m not really expecting or hoping for many (if any) comments, I just kind of wanted to have a short vent to help myself feel a little better, sorry if this put anyone in a bad mood.",t2_4bqul4lw,1,0

I must’ve done something pretty bad to get this depression and all of this emotional pain. Why do I have to be depressed? I don’t even know who I am anymore. What’s my identity?

Tired,"I feel drained and I don't know why. I think about other people who have it worse than me and continue with their lives and I wonder how. I really thought I was getting better. I'm not entirely sure what's wrong with me but I really really thought I was getting through it. I started high school again and I did well in the first semester. And then I got sad again. I know it wasn't for no reason but I also know that if I could be just a little stronger emotionally I wouldn't sabotage myself, I wouldn't be so hurtful to my family or so negligent towards my friends. It's not like I don't try to work on myself or look for solutions but in the last two years I've become so weak. It seems like any little thing tips me over to the point I need to ruin at least one thing in my life. Sometimes it can be fixed but usually not fully. I feel like a horrible person all the time. I really think I am. I know I'm kind and polite for the most part but I also know I'm stubborn and bratty and I can be really mean to my family. 
I don't know why I came out so angry. I've always been so angry and nothing ever satisfied me, I cried all the time and I still do. 
I guess it's just easier to say I was born angry than to admit I'm a brat. 
I was so mean and ungrateful and now I'm just bitter.
If I was just nicer and less stubborn I know that my family wouldn't be as broken as it is now. 
All I had to do was be nice. Or at least happy. Even now that's all I need to do but I don't. 
I just feel so guilty because when I think about the problems that happened when I was younger they always seemed to be caused by me. My parents arguing, my siblings fighting, or even things that happened to myself. I'm always the cause. 
Now that my sister has gone a little crazy, my family probably thinks we're both demons but she's not. Only I am. 
All I had do was be nice to her but I've always been so narcissistic. I only paid attention to myself.  I was so mean to her. I remember once she wanted to read a book I hadn't touched for months and I took it back and got mad at her. And I think wow one of the biggest reasons I never fell into her crowd was because I liked and what if I had just let her read that book what difference would it made. There are so many moments where if I had just been a little less selfish or a little more happier I could've prevented so many conflicts. 
 I have some reason to be sad or angry but I'm 17 almost 18 and I know I can't keep blaming everyone for my shitty personality. 
I'm so hopeful about the future. I've always been. Even during the most depressing year of my life I still was hopeful. I just don't know how long I can deal with myself and everything in my life just running on hope. I'm so tired. Im not sleeping again and I constantly feel like throwing up. I feel so drained and as if I'm going to faint. I'm such a loser. I really never thought I'd be the person I am today. I can't even finish high school. I have no talents. No interests. My family finds me annoying or they hate me or both. I have good friends but I know i burden them alot and I know if I died they'd be okay. 
I just feel so lost and alone. I'm anxious and I never feel in control of myself. I just wish I was better person. I wish I was smart and pretty and talented and I wish I was kinder and braver and stronger. I wish I had been more selfless. 
I just hate so many things.  I hate myself. I hate my family. I hate how cruel the world can be and the fact that if there is a god then all the evil in the world was planned and how if there isn't one it means that that's just how the world is 
I don't know what I'm typing Im not in control right now. I don't even know what I mean. I'm just typing cause I'm scared.  I feel so weird. I feel like this morning. Not in control distant.

I think it was my body fighting my brain I was nervous and before i cut deep enough I got fuzzy and tingly and I don't think I was out for more than two seconds but when I came to and my head was clear I felt okay again. I left the college and went home. I want to stab myself. I always feel like stabbing myself. I'm not afraid to anymore. I just don't want to be alone but I don't know how I'd stab myself in front of ppl. Its too much attention and there's a bigger possibility of being stopped. I would take pills but I've heard it doesn't always work. I just want to die and I think I'm becoming less scared to. I don't really care about what I'm leaving. Mostly just what could happen if I didn't but Ive become to weak to tough it out til then. I'm also starting to see through the lie of toughing jt out until whatever ""then"" is. I'm mostly afraid of what comes after death but I'm starting to learn to just accept whatever happens because it's going to happen anyways. I'm curious though and I think that makes me less scared cause at least I'll have the answer to one of the world's toughest questions.  I'm so tired but I don't want to stop typing cause I'm so scared. I'm so scared I'm so scared please I just want to be loved I just want to do something good and I think the most selfless thing I'll do in my life is kill myself. I really think it'll be soon j really want it to be tonight. I like to believe in the 12:34 myth. How if u see that time it means you're currently on the right path and j see it right now and I don't know. I'm tired. My head's cloudy again and j feel fuzzy injsut want to die I hate everything about myself.  I'm not good and I deserve to die. I messed up alot  and I'm such an evil person.

"I love irony, its like a fun twist on Hypocrisy!","I've always had urges, I've always fought them off  I've always been the golden boy of mental health recovery stories that people use, it's ironic that I've helped a lot of people convince them not to commit suicide and here I am, irony is a really beautiful thing, it's like a fun twist on hypocrisy in a way, even though I've tried my best to help people I won't fucking forget those who I wasn't able to help, their existence always haunts me so I keep doing it I keep helping, not because they haunt me but because I hate that I'm selfless, and I hate how much I fucking do for people and how many times people have abused that part about me, it just hurts...........it hurts a lot whenever I think about it and its all the time I always do my best for people im always there for people, but whenever I need help where is everyone they just.........vanish, Ive always had suicidal urges and urges where I wanna go back to the way that I was.......that being similar to living under a rock with no connection whatsoever or human connection,  im not sure where ill be after posting this but its becoming slowly larger and larger and its becoming so much harder and harder to fight.....ive fought for far too long, ive never had a childhood since my brain decided to block it out due to trauma and i just had to grow up early.

people should appreciate what they have a lot more often really it's like we're missing, an emotional common sense, I take care of others yet I can't take care of myself for fucking shit and I'm just sitting here on the edge thinking how would my head splat if its gonna be slow or fast, painless or painful.......

University,Hey there reddit. For the past two years I had a reason to live. And everything was great. Whenever my depression got too bad i was able to control it because i was hoping that things would get better if i got into university for illustration. Its the only thing i care about. Today my first rejection letter came in and im still waiting for the other two responses. I will probably get rejected from both of them since i was rejected by my 3d choice which is an easier school to get into than the other 2. Im not sure if i cant handle being rejected by all the universities i applied to. Im not sure if I'll be able to find the motivation and reapply next year. I know its a very mundane problem to have. But i dont have anything else in my life that gives me a reason to continue living and art is the only thing i thought i was good at.,t2_5wf3dxiu,2,0

My life will never change.,"I'm starting to realize that my life will never change, it will remain the same no matter I do and that I will never be happy.

I'm twenty years old but adulthood is not what I thought it would be. By now, I thought I would be independent. That I would be far away from the the small, miserable town I was born in and that I'd have the social life I've always dreamed of. Most foolish of all, I thought I would be happy. So far, little has changed since I graduated high school.

I still live with a family who hates me, I still sleep in the same bedroom I've had since I was an infant. I still have no friends, no social life or charisma. The only things that have changed is that I've barely managed to keep a C average in college and that my day dreams are no longer enough to keep me satisfied.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was twelve and nearly attempted on my 15th birthday. The only thing that kept me going were the ""It'll get better"" lies that I was dumb enough to fall for. After that, I anxiously waited until my high school graduation but was sick with the realization that things didn't automatically get better... God, I am a fucking idiot.

and to make matters worse, everytime, I talk about wanting to change, my family just discourages me. Like today, in the car, I told my grandmom that I was going to get a job and need advice on somethings. Instead of helping me, she just told me that ""I could never handle it"" and reminded of how ""socially retarded"" I am. I said ""what ever it takes to get me out of this town forever."" She just sneered and said ""it'll take years, if ever."" Hell, she wants me to end it all. 

Part of me wants to prove her wrong but I knows she's right. I need to face the fact that things will never change until I finally build up the courage to hang myself. Unless some miracle happens, unless someone comes into my life and takes me away from everything, I don't think I will make it to my twenty-first birthday.",t2_5wd0m95h,3,0

I (21F) have been thinking about ending it lately but I fear how it will affect my loved ones,"Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile and in a rush to post this. Been in a rough spot lately. Not sure who I would tell IRL so I figured maybe you, random strangers, could offer some support and advice. My situation is complex in many ways and it’s an intersection of many things that have led to this. I have struggled consistently with major depression for a little over a decade (I’m 21 now). After years of failing classes and skipping school under the guise that I was just bored (could never admit I was depressed), things finally began to turn around in April of 2018. I had a solid group of friends, was doing well at my job, and acing my college classes. It all came crashing down in September 2018 when one of my best friends committed suicide. The 18 month anniversary was last week and it’s finally sinking in that he truly is gone. I have experienced hardship before and gotten through it, but something about this feels impossible to heal from. I’ve gone to therapy, I take medication, I eat well and exercise regularly. I stopped smoking weed and I only drink socially. I feel like I’m doing everything I should be doing, taking care of myself as well as I can. But lately it feels like this grief and trauma has turned me into a shell of the person I was finally getting to become. I still laugh and smile with my friends, I have a girlfriend who cares deeply for me, and I’m on the honor roll at my college. I tried to tell my mother my depression’s getting worse, but she told me I’m not like that anymore, that I’m better now. I feel like it would break her heart if I pressed the issue. Not sure where to go from here. Ending it has been on my mind more and more. I’m safe and I do not have a plan in place, but it’s getting harder and harder to go through this without my best friend. I go up and down and the mood swings get worse and worse. I don’t want to go through this cycle for the rest of my life.",t2_1zd7oi14,1,0

How do people feel about ‘tough love’ in this community?,"Sometimes, no amount of ‘your parents will miss you’, ‘I’m here if you want to talk’, ‘call this number’, ‘seek help’ and ‘you have so much to live for’ is enough. From experience, sometimes someone being firm but kind, challenging your ideation instead of trying to offer empty comforts, is exactly what you need. Do people generally agree or disagree with this sentiment? Is it the case that sometimes people need gentle reassurance and sometimes people need to have someone patiently challenge their reasoning for something and push them to see things from different angles? If someone was to engage you in a civil debate about your plans as opposed to simply saying ‘Don’t do that’, would you find it a helpful and potentially enlightening distraction or would it make you more likely to harm yourself? Does it depend on the person and their situation? Should a young teen struggling to cope because of cruel parents be nurtured while a person saying that everybody on the planet is awful and heartless should be firmly but kindly told that that isn’t the case? Do you ever feel that someone needs real, to-the-point advice or even hard truths, but worry about coming across as unsympathetic or making things worse? Is the sad truth that generic responses are all we can (or should) offer to each other in this community? My internal debate of the day.

No he did not die but he stopped talking to me/ignoring me here's why:

One day we were coming back from school with a few friends and a black friend of ours (important in a bit) when we say some gypsyes (which we had a problem with) and my black friend said he wants to buy something from the bookstore which you only had to walk a bit forward but suddenly they go left and thw gypsyes start following them and from then on i don't know what happend .

I'd catch a plane and visit my online friend - we've chatted for the past 10 years. I'd have a letter for him too, but I'd want to deliver it personally.

Then I'd catch another plane into a very isolated, small Canadian town. I was there last year. The temperatures are very low. 

I'd take my antidepressants and I'd walk out. In the night. The cold would kill me after a few hours. The beauty, that I have already seen, would be everything I want to see when I leave.

I think of all this, and I feel happy. It's not a plan for now - I'm waiting for my mom to go, first. I realized I can't do it while she's still alive. I've accepted to live as whatever I will be in the next few years. I don't have any ambitions - the bare minimum is fine.

If they knew some things about me I haven’t told really anyone, they’d probably hate me and be ashamed to know me. I just wish I could tell them how sorry I am and just not exist. Some days I feel so bad I just lay in bed and cry until I’m almost throwing up and then I’ll smile and do a peace sign in the mirror and tell myself ‘I’m okay and I barely have any problems.’ I wish I could just sleep for a long time or something. I don’t want to die but I do? I’m also so scared of death I don’t know what to do. I wish I could just disappear into the universe and sky. I’m sorry, mom.

Suffocating,"I'm suffocating. Drowning within a constant numbness that's been growing within me for years. There is nothing that satisfies me. Job, family, friends, sex, games whatever it may be. I feel nothing towards anything. I feel as though I'm stuck in a void, this never ending blackness that consumes me and pulls me away from the things that should be important or held dearly by me. 

I never want to get out of bed and it's an effort every morning to move. I go through my days having conversations with myself as to how I feel. This voice within me constantly berating me telling myself I'm worthless and have no place in this life. 

I have no desires nor wants, dreams or ambitions at best I just exist like a mosquito sucking the blood from whatever gives me a short burst of any kind of feeling other than this constant blunt scraping in the back of my head. 

I wear a mask every day for my wife who has her own things to deal with in which I try so hard to help with. For my mother who I don't want to worry about me. For my sister who is growing into a young woman and needs all the support she can get right now. For the few friends I have who just wouldn't understand or who I'm afraid would exile me for being different. For myself because the person I am inside my head is vulgar, dusgusting bile with no consistency no purpose. 

I just am. 

I don't rightly know what I expect to gain from this post other than a feeble attempt to romove the thoughts within me elsewhere for a time so as to be free for only a short while. I can't cope with this in my head any longer its like lice in my hair itching, scratching, scraping it never ends. I just need it to end, to stop. I need to silence the silence. 

I don't know how much more I can take the thoughts of suicide and death, while somewhat comforting are happening more and more often. I feel as though I'm caught in limbo and being pressured to make a choice. 

This was the best way I felt I could articulate what goes on inside my head and I've left plenty out as the post would probably never end. If you made it this far sorry for my rambling.",t2_14v3uy,12,0

I don't know what to think or do anymore. I'm becoming beyond overwhelmed,"Today was one of those days where I struggled to focus my eyes on what I wanted to pay attention to. I did a little running around with one of my closest friends and it felt like I was constantly out of focus and dimly aware. I don't even know if that makes a lick of sense.

I'm on Vyvanse. I was told that I probably had dysthymia (which is like very minor depression) and maybe a little anxiety, all related to ADD. Which, okay, fine. Because the Vyvanse worked sometimes. But it wore off today and everything else adds up. I just want to not exist. Like just letting myself sit and not think anything is pretty nice.

My mom doesn't consider our stay in her ex-boyfriend's house to be all that traumatic, I guess. I don't know if I'm lying when I say it was. I really hate myself. I despise my body, and my face. My personality is awful. I'm mean, and either too loud or mumbling, and I'm just wrong. I'm pretentious. Hypocritical. Every time I do something sexual I feel revolting, yet I keep meeting guys who I maintain such a relationship with. I had all these plans; I was going to be a lawyer and help my mom and dad. How can I function as an adult when I can't even like a part of myself?

I hate my dad, which makes me hate myself. He's pitiful. I hate him so much for what he did to my mom. And I resent my mom for what she put us through, even though essentially none of it was her fault. Recently, I've been really mad at her for all sorts of things.

I have a car, and I pay for its gas. I don't have my license, and she won't take me to get it because she thinks I'll fail, yet she also won't take me to practice driving. I know how to fucking drive. I can parallel park (not that it matters- I can afford to lose a mark here and there) better than she can. I need a car so I can get a job so I can leave faster. As it is, I have to live with her and her fucking boyfriend and her fucking chickens. 

I'm failing all of my classes. I'm in dual enrollment, meaning I take college classes that add a credit both for high school and college. If I fail a class, I'll have to go back to the high school next year. If I have to go back to the high school, I might actually kill myself. I'm not kidding when I say it. I had to go there yesterday for upcoming senior scheduling and I felt shaky and just fucking terrible.

It would be so much easier to just die. And better in general, because all I seem to be doing is making things worse. I'm going to fail these classes and wind up back where I was. And where my mom worked so hard to get me out of. I'm such a piece of shit. And listen to all of this, it's just some bullshit call for sympathy. What am I trying to get out of it, a kind word? What can any of you even hope to do, if you've even read this far? You can't do anything. We're all fucking awful. There is no such thing as a good person. We're all lying, and the worst part is so many of us are saying that we're doing a good thing by it. I hope I don't wake up.",t2_ajcw04q,2,0
I'm struggling and I hate myself.,"Hi, everyone.

I'm struggling with my life. I spend most of my time on social media to keep my head straight. I'm hopeless, I'm nobody to everyone. I have been trying to find a full job but I failed. I wanted to help my family but I failed. I want to help myself, but I failed! I don't know anymore, I lost myself. I'm depressed. I feel so dead inside.

Sometimes, I cried thinking why I'm still alive today when I did nothing in this world except breathing the fresh air. I feel like I should have kill myself.  I wish and wait someone come to me, talk to me, talk about my problem but nobody is coming, or maybe, because I don't have a lot of friends who knows me better. Sometimes, I hurt myself too, I punched the desk, the door and the wall.

I also have an anxiety, when it comes,  I hurt myself because I coudln't handle it. I'm not afraid to kill myself but I feel guilty leaving them behind, leaving someone who cares about me.

My head already hurt thinking about all my problems. I couldn't even sleep at night. ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG.

I'm sorry for my bad english. I just wanted to share what I feel right now.",t2_5we3ijyd,2,0
Avoiding death by coincidence.,"I have probably tried to kill myself about 10 times now, with 3 of the times being very much intended to kill myself. What I mean is that most of the times I try to kill myself I lose my nerve. I don't own a firearm, or any drugs that I could easily overdose on but I do live close to the tallest bridge on the west coast so that's where I go. The problem is that its about a thirty minute drive there and 20 minute walk, by the time I actually get there I lose my nerve and erroneously convince myself that I could get help and get better. That was the story for 7 of the times I failed, I either get there and can't jump, or I convince myself on the drive that I can get help which I know is impossible, but I guess the human mind will try anything to save itself. The three times that I was for sure going to commit were also stopped by the most random of interactions. The first time came around January and I had failed to get the required internship for one of my classes, so I decided to kill myself that day. I decided to go to class anyway just in case I could delay the inevitable. Its a very early class, so I can usually get in there hours early and there is no one in there. That day I went in early and there was one other student in there who just happened to be in the same situation I was in, and he taught me how to drop out of the class and register for another one mid term so that I could stay a full time student and avoid expulsion. If I had decided to show up later on in the day or anything else I would be dead right now.

The second time came later in the quarter and I had parked my car much closer on the bridge this time, within eyesight, to make the walk shorter. It was around 1 am, and just as I was climbing over the suicide prevention fence a cop showed, he was just passing by and so I hid to not draw his attention. He eventually drove by my car and shown a strong flashlight into my car eventually doing a u turn going back towards town. I was terrified that he may tow it or something, and if I failed to kill myself I would be stranded there and have to call my family for help which would give the game away. So I told myself that I would park it somewhere else, and by the time I did that I had lost my nerve and drove back home. If I had shown up fifteen minutes later, or if that cop just never drove by there I would be dead today. 

The third time came just today, I need to register for graduation soon, but filling out forms and such terrifies me so I have been putting it off. However, just today I submitted some forms and the I had some panic attacks, thinking I had done it too late and would be expelled. I told myself that I was going to kill myself today becuase of this, but thought I should go see the academic counseling services for info just in case I lost my nerve once again. Well they told me that it was fine and I could still file to graduate and as such my motivation to die for that day disappeared again. Not that my motivation to die isn't still there, even if everything goes right, I still harbor an intense hatred for myself, as I always have. The point is that if I had decided to just leave class and not go to that counseling appointment I would be dead in a few hours. 

Has anyone else had this happen where you get so close to finally succeeding in killing yourself but something throws you off and end up failing. If I was religious I would assume divine intervention but I know that its just random bullshit. 

Tl;dr: I keep trying to kill myself but random bullshit keeps me from succeeding.",t2_dpueq,3,0

Under alot of stress and pain and could use some help.,"Over the past 2 months I've been feeling really shit. Not sad just shit. I've never related to the lyric, ""I feel so goddamn empty."" More. 

I dont understand where it's coming from but it's most likely that I'm 17 and my whole family is now emigrating from South Africa, where I live to the UK. although I feel no resentment towards this and I'm fine with moving in my head I must be disliking it or something cause recently it became very real and it's making me spiral mentally.

I have no friends cause once they learned I was moving to the UK they all carried on with their school lives and forgot about me cause I'm not attending due to the move. I originally told my one friend I'm depressed and my eating has gone out the window to a point where I'm lucky if I eat 2 sandwiches in a day. I'm not insecure, I'm not sad, I'm not angry and I'm not vengeful or spiteful towards my parents. I know I'm loved but I just feel so empty. As if nothing matters, not even my life.

My friend I originally told said to tell her if I got suicidal which I have had many I dont want to be here thoughts and done some dumb things like swallowing lots of pills like mybulen and stealing my moms antidepressants and taking them in excess but I did it just to feel something. Not to die. I dont want to take my life but I dont want to exist. I feel like I'll never amount to anything and nothing matters or ever will.

I'm sure I could find more to write about but it's not coming to mind right now, just looking for some advice other than it will get better cause that's what everyone says so I guess I have no choice but to believe it. Thanks bye.",t2_2vmxn2p3,3,0

I want to end my life at 20 years old,"There is nothing further for me to experience, no reason to continue living. On the surface, I have an ideal life. I am a 20 year old caucasian woman. Born to a wealthy family in a Westernized country, I was given every educational and recreational opportunity that one could desire. I have above-average physical attractiveness, which helps to compensate for my abysmal personality.

However, I have already squandered most of the advantages that I was born with. I chose a useless major when I entered college, and I am attempting to transfer in to my university's nursing program as a last-minute hail-Mary. There is no guarantee that I will get in, and if I don't, I would have wasted approximately $100,000 of my parents tuition money on a fucking *liberal arts*degree. My GPA is projected to drop to a meager 3.1 by the end of the semester, given the fact that I got a C on a midterm and multiple F's on reading pop quizzes. Even in the pre-nursing classes where I am motivated to work hard, I can barely scrape by with a B after hours of dedicated study time. I have aspirations to become a nurse anesthetist, but that dream is becoming increasingly unlikely due to my academic incompetence.

I despise myself so deeply that I often fantasize about hanging myself in my dorm room or throwing myself off of a building. Throughout my adolescence and young adulthood, I often wished that I could replace my soul with a perfect, emotionless automaton who got A's on every exam, ran marathons, collected a litany of accolades, and secured a high-paying white collar job. Just a placeholder who would make my parents proud so that they could boast to their country-club friends.

I will probably be a drain on society in the future, so I might as well end it all now. I cannot picture any amount of success in my future, despite my incredibly privileged upbringing. Family and friends have told me that I am a 7-8/10 on the scale of physical beauty, but all of my attempts at flirtation have been rejected.

Whenever I see successful individuals (doctors, lawyers, engineers, CEO's, programmers, scientists), I always feel sick to my stomach, despite the fact that these people are primarily responsible for economic and technological progression. I cannot live with my mediocrity anymore. I don't even think that I could marry someone who was more financially successful than me, even if it would be in my best interest to do so. My nonexistent self esteem simply couldn't handle it.

I don't know where to start with this, but it feels like everyday is taking longer and longer to move on, I constantly think about wanting to kill myself while driving anywhere honestly. I no longer have the motivation to continue, the only reason I have left is my mother. I want to get help, I want to change, but I feel like I've been a burden on my mother for so long. About one to two years ago, I had a breakdown during work and told my boss who then proceeded to call non-emergency police(I think) and ended having a ambulance take me to a nearby center for this kind of problem. I called my mom to pick me up because they were not going to allow me to leave work or that building alone, but I felt like it was nothing but upsetting for my mother to be in this problem where her youngest son is still having depression after having another break down when I was 13 in middleschool and was brought to a child care mental facility because I told another kid to kill himself but I outed myself towards the school therapist that I wanted to end my life. I was there for 3 days, but it felt like a month. I don't know why I was dealt such a shit start in the beginning of my life where I was getting bullied at school and god forbid my own home, by my brother and extended family. I was a living punching bag but I stayed quiet, I played along because I know no one wants to deal with my shit. no one ever has, even my own father was completely ignorant of my problems being a nurse and dealing with people like us. It was upsetting, how could no one see that I was in pain? All because I was putting on a act, I knew my mother knew but I feel like she is too afraid to help me... she probably isn't but I can't shake the feeling off. All through school I was always crying at least once a day in the bathroom during lunch because I knew was a fucking outcast. I didn't have any friends during middleschool, nor did I in elementary. I was bullied there the most actually, so I wasn't surprised. I had a small group of ""friends"" in highschool but that dwindled down to basically none so I am currently alone besides the group I have online. I've escaped my life so much through online games where I barely recall what I did as a kid. I'm only 22 but why do I feel like I've been here for 30? Just years of torment and suffering yet I've had no one reach out and help. I want to end it, I need to. I hate living, I hate the people in this world, we're fucking nothing yet we keep pushing each other down for what? I hate it here, but I can't end it yet. I still have my mother, but once my only reason is gone, so will I. I can't bear to think what my mother would do, it's the worse feeling ever. I don't think I'd ever be fucked enough to be able to end it all while she is still alive. I have to wait, I have at least 40+ years before I go, if all goes good for her of course. I don't plan on every meeting anyone or having kids. I've already had the love of my life 4 years but she left me on a very vague string and I've been suffering since then, it's been a year or so since she apologized but I still hate it, she couldn't give me a reason on why she did what she did, be it regret, shame, or whatever other excuse. we haven't spoken since and I don't ever expect to meet her again. I don't think I'd ever be able to write a suicide note while my mom is alive. I'm sorry this got long, I had to say something. Goodbye for now.",t2_1ex6mxdg,1,0

Sorry mom sorry dad,"I am really sorry for everything. I am sorry for embarrassing you. I don’t even know how to tell you this. If you are reading this then I have probably killed myself. I am sorry it had to be this way but I was always evasive or my problems. I could never ever meet them head on. I am sorry I was weak. 
I messed up and I am sorry. I know I was always a good student but I really fucked up badly. I am three days away from my exam and I probably will mess it up. I don’t know the syllabus and I don’t know the material properly. 
You have probably invested lakhs into getting me tutors and have always been there. 
What I didn’t tell you was I was going through depression and constantly indulging in self harm. That with my careless attitude has cost me my future. 
You spent so much money out of your own pockets to put me through sat classes and tuitions and even money for my applications. 
I know how hard you worked to earn it, how you have gone from having nothing to being a really successful 
However, me being the useless fucking cunt I am wasted all of it. I know I was so close to being in my dream college. I even got an admission offer but considering the disaster that will happen on my exam day I highly doubt that offer will hold. 

I’ll try my best to study. I will try my best to finish my curriculum, but if you ever read this. Mom, dad I am sorry! I don’t want to ever embarrass you! Sorry

Edit: I told my parents about my depression and my self harm. They just helped me calm down and just told me to do the best I can. All of us have come to terms with the fact that I might not do well. Even though I am not giving up I am also going with the reality of things. I feel like the burden has been off my shoulders. I still feel a little sad that despite coming this far I screwed up in the end and it will cost me my dream college, however, I still have a back up with comparatively lower conditionals. Thank you for your support. My exam is in two days ( on the 13th) shall keep you posted on how things turn out. Things are bad but I will figure something out.

Also, my parents and I have agreed that I should take therapy after my exams to deal with my mental health. 

Thank you guys for helping

"I feel doomed, should i?",I feel like im feeling everything a lot more intense than others. Even from a young age suicide was an option to me. It was weirdly comforting me. So i always used it to comfort myself. But these days i feel like sh*t is just really started to hit me. I just realized i started to really consider it and it feels weird. So i used to self harm but i never told anyone or anything and im currently on antidepressants but lately i tricked myself to another self harm method. I was tattooing myself at home with regular needles and it started to be routine of mine and then i realised i really dont care about what the tattoo is. I just feel pain comforting. Soni stopped but i feel really fragile and maybe i cant be saved? Maybe im doomed. Idk. I really think i should die? I have am ordinary life but im a really problematic person inside so i feel like i cant handle with anything so whats the point? Im a really strong looking person but everybody knows im a little bit depressed. i always tried to look emotionally stable and strong but i feel like i just cant anymore. Its like im a pinch away from a mental breakdown. When people make mean “jokes” that I usually dont care i feel like crying. I just want to yell everyone please be nice to me its not funny im really about to end it all. What do you guys think? Should i be saved and be unproblematic?,t2_5wddark0,3,0
I can't think of a good title,"Hello everybody. That night I'm feeling loneliest and sort of tired I guess. I'm not a social person and I try to avoid any social contacts. But that doesn't matter now. I just wanted to tell you my story. If that's allowed here.
I am an unwanted child. My parents have told me that. Many times.
I was born in a small town, where winter is warm and summer is extremely hot. Ordinary town, ordinary people. I was a happy child until the age of 11. Then it all started.
I was in the 5th grade. New school. New people. And unreasonable hate towards me, since the 1st day of being there. I was a friendly child, I tried to get along with everybody, but I guess there was still something wrong with me. I got beaten, my books torn, my shoes stolen, my clothes stepped on and ripped. I was even beaten by my teacher. Parents didn't care. All they said was ""Deal with it yourself. You're 11 already.""
So I dealt with it on my own.
I was trying to be as agressive as I can. And soon I was alone. Everybody thought I was crazy, but it was good for me, because I colid finally rest and not be afraid of being bullied again.
My classmates (and not only them) spread gossips about me, told everybody I'm a whore, drunkard, prostitute, lesbian, how ugly I am. I still don't even know why they did that.
But school wasn't the only place where I got molested.
My parents always told me how miserable, stupid, fat, ugly, short and smelly I am. They forced me to get good grades, even when I was almost breaking down. And when I won competitions, olympiades, they never cared. I was always a shame.
I wanted to be an artist. Since the day I saw my first anime. I knew I was going to be an artist. And that didn't happen. I was also interested in biology, so get a bachelor's degree in biology. And now my parents are angry at me. Because it's still not what they wanted. They can't get over the fact that I'm not a mathematics person. And I can't count very well. I can draw. But every piece of art is shit for them. They hate art and music. I honestly don't know if there's something they like.
They never let me do anything on my own, so now when I'm 18 and I'm trying to be independent, they just lose their shit.
I don't have close friends, and I don't have friends at all. I'm a shit-in basically, i hate myself so much there's no mirror in my room. I hate every inch of my body and I want a plastic surgery when I have enough money. I nearly stopped drawing. Because, I guess, it really doesn't make much sense after all.
Now I'm studying at the university. It's fun, teachers are good, I'm in a group with good people. But I think it's temporary. Everything will be bad in no time.
I tried to commit suicide around 5 times probably, but something always interrupted me and I made it out alive. That's not my full story of course. But I don't feel like finishing it now. As the ending, I wanted to say that the suicidal hotline told me I'm just whining. And I'm weak. And I'm annoying. Yes, shit is real. I honestly don't know why I wrote it. Probably it'll get deleted.

I just want a reprieve.,"I apologize for any lack of coherency on my part.

I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety from since I was really young. I’ve been diagnosed with a few other mental-health conditions that made life even more unnecessarily harder than it has to be, and sweet Christ, I just want this shit to be over. The only thing that has ever held me back from suicide is that—to me—it always felt like that would be the most selfish thing I could ever do. I think I have such a firm viewpoint on it because my mother has constantly tried to kill herself with no degree of real success but plenty of physical repercussions. There’s a long laundry-list of mental illness and abuse on both sides of the family and I’ve always thought that suicide was just an inevitability regardless of how hard I fought against it.

My homelife has always been abusive and toxic. When I was young I made a promise to myself that, if it never got any better by twenty, I’d just end it. By the time twenty rolled around, things had only deteriorated further, but I have a co-dependent best friend who I know would be totally destroyed if I went through with it. She’s told me many times that if I go she will follow me. It’s the thing I think of the most when my thoughts go dark, and hell, even when they’re not. I don’t think she realizes that she’s essentially made me responsible for her own reason to go living, so I fret over getting in some sort of freak accident if I go outside.

Outside of that, I’ve been in a relationship since my early high school days. It started as this tumultuous, blatantly toxic thing that we both sort of fell into. Since we were both hurt and needing, we just fumbled our way through it and damaged each other a lot along the way. Recently, we’ve finally made a breakthrough and it seems like our relationship will actually begin to be healthy, but it’s come at the cost of a lot. I endured some of the worst days of my life for over a month to try and make sure this relationship survived.

I lost the only person who was a real anchor in my life about eight years ago now and I’ve never been the same since. Though he was my grandfather, he was really my Dad in that he raised and was always a place of sanity in a family full of narcissistic monsters. I lost him the day after his birthday. He had just ordered some off-brand Nerf guns for us to have fun with—he also had really bad depression and had been laid-off from his job a few months back—and then I woke up to my grandmother screaming and him just laying dead against the wall. I grabbed his ankles and dragged him from the wall so that my grandmother could perform CPR. The paramedics made it and could not resuscitate him.

Shortly after that, my grandmother started sleeping around with men left and right, demanding that I work several jobs just to keep me out of the house. Even his funeral was a joke—my biological father breezed into town as he so often does at the worst times of my life to get drunk and make it all about himself.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going for other people. I haven’t ever really lived for myself. There’s never been any joy for me in existing, so I just strive forward for the people I care about, but I feel like there’s a void in me that just keeps eating away.

I just don’t know what to fucking do anymore.

Thanks for listening. I know this is really me screaming into the void more than anything else, but I am just so fucking lost right now.",t2_h24tt,2,0
Enjoying life ?,"Hello anyone,

I know God isn't real, I know that from my social class and an absolute embarrassment of my genetics that my life won't be worth it, that isn't depression talking, that's from a rational viewpoint and I know it. That will be the same for virtually all of us, our lives are work, so we can afford to live - why? I was born into this life, and expected to go through education, then work for the rest of my life and then retire and then die. We literally just live, that's all we do, we work so hard just so we can live. 

We're here for a period of time and then that's it, we're done - there's nothing more. Humans are superstitious about everything and want to create meaning in everything and we know that so much it would be strange to say it isn't a fact, and when on the topic of the meaning of life, religion is just a byproduct of human superstition. So while we're here, it's like a very select few out of the billions get the privilege to live a life of huge fame, wealth and admiration from others. Then the majority live mediocre lives, life's okay and that's it. Then people like you and me, we're just born broken, whether that be genetics or how we are raised, we're just fucked. There's no better way to put it, a lot of people like to say that ""Oh no it's just the depression talking!"", ""Things get better, just have a positive mindset."" or some nonsense like that, Philosophers ponder this just as much as we do and as a matter of fact I think it's the most realistic view of the world. It feels like out of all people on earth I'm the only one I know that sees reality for what it is. If you don't believe me search ""Depressive realism"", people have supported this year's before I've said it. 

Life's shit and meaningless, that's the cold truth and probably a lot of people aren't willing to admit that because you'll end up like us, depressed. I've reached out for help twice and the only thing I got in response was a suggestion to try exercise, can't say I didn't try.",t2_3q3lxc4a,1,0

I’m stuck with living,"I’ve been suicidal since 5th grade, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder in 9th, although I’m certain the depression goes back years before my diagnosis, and I’m just about ready to give up.

Except I can’t.

I made a promise to someone that I wouldn’t kill myself, and for reasons too long to get into, I just can’t break that promise. But I’m really struggling. I’m missing school, I’m getting worse, and scheduling therapy has taken over a year and still, there’s no appointment. I wake up everyday wishing I hadn’t, and then hate myself for wanting to break the promise. I feel trapped, and I just really want to die. I don’t want to wait and see if my life is 100 times better tomorrow, I want to die today. But I can’t. So I’m just stuck with living a really bad life, which isn’t even a bad life without the depression. It just feels like I’m gonna have to live like this to old age, which is really gonna suck.

Die from the skies by small plane,"So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

She’s been through a lot and during our argument I’ve stated that and said that I completely understand that her life has been “tougher” than mine. But because she’s an immigrant she thinks that my life in a better country is perfect and full of no problems. During my youth she’s kicked me out of the house for minimal things. The one that we just got into an argument about, just a few minutes ago, was whether the time she kicked me out of the house for not washing everyone’s dishes the day before my high school graduation. To clarify, I washed my own dishes as per our agreement. I just came home and I instantly did my own dishes. She then assumed that I was mad at her for not washing everyone’s dishes and just my own. I didn’t talk to her yet but she just assumed that I was mad cause I was doing my part of the agreement. Now she argues, after years after the incident, that washing everyone’s dishes is the “common sense” thing to do. Let me just say that this wasn’t the only time I’ve been kicked out. I’ve been kicked out for two weeks during Christmas twice because I wouldn’t plug the colour-coordinated plugs in the T.V. when she was standing right in front of it with all of my extended family members. You know the ones that literally has the same colours as the plugs they go into the T.V. None of my family members even helped me. I’m so done. I don’t want to be here anymore.

I'm Tired,"Pardon my grammar, english is not my first language. And I'm too tired to organize my thoughts

I'm 22 female. I do identify as a lesbian. I live in the Philippines if that helps. I am overweight, unhealthy, my salary is small but enough to keep me alive and contribute to the expenses/bills in our house (I live with my mom and grandma).

Work wise... I would say that I am quite unhappy. Stress has been piling up. I'm just honestly overwhelmed with the new responsibilities I have (I did accept those responsibilities but I wasn't informed/it wasn't stated that it would be massive, I was only told that the tasks would be minor). 

At home.. me being a lesbian is a taboo topic. Both my mom and grandma are hard core catholics. They are otherwise supportive. Sometimes they can be a little manipulative but its very minimal.

I have a history of these... Really low moments, where I entertain suicidal thoughts. Its been there ever since I was in 6th grade. I know the issues I've posted here might not seem like much but they're just the tip of the iceburg.

Anyways my main concern is:

I'm planning on ending my life in a couple of days. I've already written my letter.

I feel living in this system is living my life in vain.,"US citizen. You know how it is. Poor health coverage. Debt based education. Pitiful social security. Horrid politicians digging the middle and lower class our early graves.  

I've really been struggling lately with the fact that I have dreams and passions, but the 9-5 (or in my case 7 - 5:30) grind is stealing my will and my energy to do what I actually want to do. 

I've been seeking therapy for a year now. I had grief over a recent tragedy to cope with. I struggled for a bit to find some direction and bend my life into shape. 

I did that, but-

Now that I'm starting my path on a job I always thought I'd want - I realized that this isn't giving me pride or passion. I don't feel fulfilled doing this. I don't want to be at work right now as I type this. 

I'm so tired of waking up and forfeiting days of my life that I'll never get back, just to fill someone else's pockets. 

Time away from who I love and what I love to do - I'm sick of it. 

But that's the reality, and I feel such a desperate need to escape. I don't want to die. But I have the sinking suspicion that there's no other way to live in this era; live to work an ultimately meaningless job just for money. 

You get two, maybe three days to be yourself and live **your** life. Fulfill ***your*** needs, possibly leaving room for others. 

But then you get four to five days out of the week that you just want to get over with. That you don't want to live through at all. 

And then you get what? 2 weeks off *maybe*, depending on the job? 
2 weeks of your life in exchange for an entire year wasted.

It's like I'm doomed to die an unfulfilled drone in the corporate machine.

""But I'm scared""
""Talk to them""
""What if they think I'm annoying, or they notice that I've got sweaty palms""
""They don't care about your palms. Go""
""But, it's scary""
And rinse and repeat. Then I walk away like I wasn't just fucking yelling at myself. I hate it. I get angry at myself for not being able to talk to anyone. I hate my voice. I hate how I can't go a single day without crying. I hate how I even considered buying drugs from someone just to make me feel alright. I hate me.
I just can't do this anymore. I know that there are people who worry about me, and they want me to go outside and make friends and do normal human things, and I know I'm causing them pain, but I can't do anything about this. I can't help it. I've tried, believe me. I've tried being outgoing and happy and stuff, I even took up meditation and exercising and stuff. It didn't work. In fact I hated myself even more. The one time I talked to someone out in public I started crying. Maybe I don't know how to be alive. But you know, everybody says you can cute depression with a smile. And I'm smiling. I cut so many smiles into my skin. I want to die and go somewhere else

i failed to commit suicide and now i'm planning to try it again,"the first time i try to commit suicide was about a month ago, i've been planning it long before that, the plan was that i'll get so drunk and just swallow any pills that i can find at home, so there i was drunk as fuck try to enjoy what suppose to be the last hour of my life, reading old chats, looking at my friends instagram, seeing their face again for one last time, dancing and singing to my favorite song by myself, when i  thought i had enough and was about swallow my pills, a notification came up on my phone, it's a text from a friend asking me for a chat, then i took a picture of my glass which contains a little bit left of alcohol, i said i'm drinking, then she replied ""oh okay, nevermind then, i won't disturb you"", i replied ""do me a favor, make sure if i'm still alive tomorrow"" idk why i said that, then i went straight to sleep, and i don't know why i didn't take the pills.

i woke up the next morning to her text saying ""hey, are you alive?"" i replied ""yeah, too bad, thanks"" at that point i realized i should've turned off my phone right before i try to swallow the pills. a couple weeks after that have been normal, i gotta admit i had hope for a while, until i finally get back to campus, and now i'm starting see everything starts to falling apart again, and now i regret for not killing myself that night. looking back at it now, maybe i just don't have the guts to do it that night, that or any other reason that my mind can't even explain. now i'm planning to do it again, i still don't know when, or will i do it, but i really wanted to, thanks for reading this to the end.

A promise I made,"I have, for the past month and a half, been depressed for no discernable reason. Masturbating doesn't help, being with friends doesn't help. Food doesn't help, and my therapist no longer seems to help either. I actually had to cut our session short 10 minutes in last week because it was too much to be there.

It is now too much to be alive. I've dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past and have even attempted a few times... The last time I attempted, it was because the person that is my entire world lashed out and made me think he hated me... I was inconsolable. We had a very long conversation, where he apologized (though I made it clear that forgiveness wasn't going to be easy) and we talked about what we meant to one another. I told him I thought I had lost him forever, and he promised he'd never leave me without saying goodbye. That he'd always come back to me if he didn't say goodbye. I promised the same, which is where my problem lies. 

I want to die. Quite frankly I could do it right now with the pills in my cabinet, but I wouldn't be able to bring myself to swallow without letting him know I'm leaving. I simply can't have that conversation and it's so frustrating and damning to have that be the promise I can't help but stick to. I am so so so fucking tired of waking up every day to this bleak and dreary world in the shitty city in which I live to continue my pointless life, but that promise keeps me tethered here.

I'm tired of being here,"Im tired of hiding.  I've been wanting to kill myself since the age of 13. I have just gone through a traumatic experience and have no support besides family members throwing me in a mental hospital, calling the police on me and forcing/suggesting me to take medication and go to therapy (background: manipulative, controlling and narcissistic family that pretty much have dictated my whole life).

They're not a help at all and I really dont want them to be. I wish I had friends to talk to but due to being told all my life that ""family is the only one you have in life"" I took that literally as a child and did not know how to maintain relationships with my peers into my adulthood. I also was bullied and taunted when I was younger and held on to this for awhile.

I would write a longer rant but I'm shaking right now since my grandmother is calling people in the next room talking about my issues, saying she is helping but she really is not. I wish I can have the courage to just put a gun to my head or do something to just fucking disappear. 

To those who have friends and family who truly support you show graditude, be thankful. God has blessed you with that support.

I hope I deserve to choose for myself,"I have suicidal thought from internal conflict or existential issue, mostly on religion topic. Being religious is hard for me. But being nonreligious is also harder. And if I die, I stake so many people's love n sincere feelings on me and I dont like that.

So I choose a stance for myself that likely to save me my life even if it's not a guarantee that after this I really be fine. But at least most probably. I prob never have a bold answer about whats the truth. 

Apart from whatever debate outside that makes my head n emotion hurt n confused, I need to have a faith (religion) and choose to it. Personally. And this is my personal choice. Don't shame me. I know the problem with religion and nonreligious too. But I cant sacrifice sanity over this irony. I dont want to hear it.

I wont say whats mine ofc. My point is I need to save my sanity. I dont know about all this existentialism shit. I agree life is miserable. But I cant make my family's like that too. Idk man. I choose whats need to be saved in urgence. I dont know. My life is miserable and I dont want to incite my suicidal thought with bothering this internal conflict.

All good (bad) things are 3?...,"How do I start? Well my life sucks. But not in the way like there are bad things and so, the general construct is so bad that I don't even see a reason to carry on. And it's funny. Because I heared from a lot of people who said they would swap with my life and so on. You could say the only good thing in my life is that I was born into a rich family so never really had to worry about money. But thats it.

I wasnt always like this. First 17 years of my life were nice, no doubt but after that it went downhill so rapidly. I lost some of my best friends, went more and more silent to the outside and idk, just became more and more depressed. The worst was how I saw people achieving so much stuff and I couldn't get done anything on my own. My friends had jobs, girlfriends and just pure joy to spend where I'm just a stupid, lonely and shy guy who no one even bothers to care about.

Now I'm 21 and got 2 suicide attempts behind me. After the first one I was just ruined for 2 months and then thought ""hey good that u didn't really kill yourself"". Then stuff got even worse with some important person in my life basically leaving me and attempt 2. And then I was so on the bottom that I still didn't get up from it. I did therapy and even the therapist had a hard time to show me something I should hold on to.

Yea and now I'm just on the verge of killing myself. I mean what do u have to loose. I don't wanna live in pain for the rest of my life and just suffer every day on. And the thing is, it won't change. So many people always told me that things will change. And maybe the circumstances or so but not who I am or what drives me or a thing like that. And I know that won't change because I was always like this. I made a list if I should kill myself or not and damn, the only contra thing I wrote was that maybe my parents would be sad about it but I don't care about that hard enough aswell I guess.

I’ve hurt them. I know they see someone beautiful, smart, popular, and capable of achieving a lot, because that’s what they see. But I don’t see it. I see the fat on my body, the acne scars, the dark circles from lack of sleep. I remember the hearts I’ve broken, the people I hurt. I remember how I shunned a few for their actions against my friends and know I was horrible. I see someone who yelled and fought with my parents when they didn’t know how I’d been abused by my stepdad. I remember how I acted spoiled during childhood play, not understanding how others felt. I remember talking to people about my pain and seeing their tears. 

I remember how I had everything my heart desired but was so alone until I hit 19 and lost weight. I know people only care because I’m an object. I give as much support as I can, I try to be there for anyone as soon as they need it. Most of my friends had a crush on me before friendship.

Hi. I’ve been suicidal for a while now. I have crippling mental health issues that just aren’t going away. My partner is getting exacerbated. She’s made an ultimatum. She’s also right. The ultimatum is both;

&amp;#x200B;

* Something I want to do, and,
* Something currently impossible to do.

My mind is telling me the only solution is to simply remove myself entirely from the scene. I have a terrible feeling if I die so will my partner. It’d be that way vice versa.

I’d like to just be done with it all. However… seeing that this is not a normal thought process. Surely all the cells in my body must want to survive? I’m gonna go to hospital.

this is a rant. i cant take this anymore god please,"i used to be so happy. I used to be excited for everything. I used to feel loved. the only thing i ever worried about was if i would be able to get home on time to watch my favourite show. 

But happy times always come to an end.

It all started when my parents divorced. My mom started going to work a lot, leaving me at my dad’s house. I wasn’t complaining though, i loved him so much. He took me to my favourite park almost everyday.

Seeing as we’re native, we were always pretty poor. But he did his best to make sure we felt happy. That we felt loved.

But one day, we (my sister and I) were dropped off at his house and he yelled at us and told us to go downstairs. 

So we did. He came down a while later and sat on the couch beside us while crying, telling us he’s sorry, that he loves us. He was crying and we just stared at the man who has been with us since birth not knowing what to do. Afterwards, he said he would bring us to the park the next day. An apology for yelling at us. We were happy, excited to have fun. We went on the rest of the day normally with the playground on our minds.

he killed himself the next day.

he hanged himself on a tree that i used to climb in the summertime. he hanged himself on a tree that’s been growing in the backyard since before we were born.

it’s been 8 years man. 8 fucking years why cant I forget him. everyone else moved on why the fuck cant i? i miss him so much i cant do this anymore, it’s too much. i want to hear his voice again, i want to hug him again, i want to go back in time but i know it’s not possible and it’s killing me.

i was 6 years old almost 7 i shouldn’t be missing him like this but i do and it’s so fuckinh painful

my chest physically hurts thinking about him and nobody knows.
i have no one to talk to anymore. my only best friend who has been with me through everything is gone. she’s gone and i put on an act everyday talking about her like we’re still friends in front of my mom because i dont want to look like a loner even though i am.

i feel like I’m walking on eggshells in this family, if i do something wrong they end up talking about me behind my back. i know they do because they do it with everyone else. i cant do anything without fearing someone might take it the wrong way.

three years ago, I found a journal my mom kept and I read it out of curiosity. there was an entry in that journal about everything that happened the day he committed suicide. he left a fucking video behind. he left a video behind on his computer and i have to live knowing that ill never see it. knowing that my mom lied to me saying he left nothing behind.

im feeling so desperate for death at this point, when will all this pain end?

i have no one to talk to. no one. i tried to talk to my mom but she’s always in a bad mood because of the constant family fights going on every single day. no one takes me seriously.

i cant do this, i don’t want to do this, im crying every night. full on bawling.

i want to die man, i want to die so bad. i even marked on the calendar the day when im gonna do it.

its less than a year away, im going to call the police first so my mom doesn’t find me then im going to hang myself

I'm giving up,A few days ago i posted in this sub and a few warm people comforted me... And somehow i felt peace... But life's a bitch. Right when i thought things are going to be better i got excluded in an event and laughed upon.. My uncle was even diagnosed with cancer... Even when i feel this pain i still have no one to talk to.. Not a single soul.. I feel so lonely and hopeless.. I dont i could ever achieve happiness.. The thought of suicide really calms me down.. Thinking that i could easily kill myself if i can't take it anymore.. And even here when i stand on the edge of a building... I dont feel fear... In fact i feel compelled to it... I would say goodbye but i have no one to say goodbye to.. What's even the point... I don't think im going to jump yet though.. Not today at least..,t2_5725t15d,1,0
I dont know what to do.,"I don't know if I just feel down for the moment or if another line of depression is hitting me again. I couldn't say what was wrong with me if I tried and I feel like too much of a burden on everyone to say anything to my roommate or ""friends"" (don't really have any... no exaggeration). My boyfriend wants to help me but HATES for me to even bring it up or think about it. My family (my grandma) lives like an hour &amp; 30 away and my car has been towed back so I can't drive it. I think everyone is tired of me.... including my boyfriend and that sucks. I'm not trying to be mean or an asshole. Idk I kinda just wanna go on a walk but this campus/ town is small and desolate so everyone (my grandma &amp; boyfriend) would have a heart attack over where I've gone once they even recognized I was gone. I don't know... I feel the same old yucky feeling forming in my chest and the thoughts are coming back. My PTSD has been off the chain lately... I honestly dont know. Kinda dont know why I'm even writing here but it's better than letting them build I guess.",t2_5otegte8,5,0
I am nothing,"For some background-I had a really bad time with depression last school year. It was my first semester in college and it started off poorly (I got cut from marching band and my hamster died on the first real day of classes) and spiraled from there. So, I took a leave at home while taking classes at community college, and switched majors. Things were better-for a little. But now, I am failing 3 of my classes. I feel I cannot do anything right. I am fat, stupid, and alone. And to add insult to injury, everyone around me is thriving. My sister just got into a school that is comparable to an ivy league school (that I got rejected from), my high school classmate who goes to the same college as me just got elected student body president, my friend from band got accepted into marching band (I've auditioned twice and been rejected twice). I've talked to my mom about this, and even my therapist, and they all just tell me to ""stay in my lane"". But staying in my lane is impossible when I have no achievements and absolutely nothing to be proud of. I can only think of my recent failures-getting cut from band, failing the calc class I tried to take during my leave in community college, the fact that the classes I am taking now are going poorly, being fat and ugly, being single (for my whole life) and friendless, and failing a bunch of classes my first year in college. I constantly feel like I am the dumbest person in my major and everyone is better than me. 

Oh, and did I mention that my dad is an alcoholic, verbally abusive asshole, whose behavior has caused my family to fall apart? 

Also, I am probably never going to be able to work in a job I love (like art or writing) because those fields are incredibly competitive and I wouldn't make money. I can't take this bullshit anymore. I don't see a point in living a life I hate and looking forward to a future I will probably also hate. 

This is probably the part I'm most ashamed of. I constantly think about my funeral, and how maybe then, people would acknowledge me and say nice things about me (even if I wouldn't be there for it). Maybe my unrequited high school crush would even show up, who knows. 

I feel like I have enough reasons to end it all, at this point I am just looking for methods and giving myself a little time to sort things out before I go. I also need to figure out a way to do it without hurting my mom and siblings too badly. It would also be good if I could get over my paralyzing fear of death and the void of nonexistence so I can actually do something instead of just being miserable.",t2_50ubkmiq,5,0

i wanna die or stop existing,"it’s been years since i feel shit, i started to feel like a worthless person since i started highschool, i didn’t want to go to the school that my mom wanted to, but i can’t do anything people started to dragged me down every single time they had a chance, as the school year was ending i read a post that was posted by my classmates on our group, that really tore me down. i convinced my dad that i didn’t want to go to that school i want to be with my old friends, but it was not a happy start people around me made fun about my appearances including my friends who i trusted the most, my mom will ridicule me in front of other people and she wouldn’t stop for hours. i was holding my tears the whole time and my mom didn’t care about my feelings all along, i worked hard to be successful one day, but she told me that i can’t do it, you’ll end up failing, but at that time i didn’t stop i still worked my ass off, so that i could succeed someday, but my mom has always some bad things to say about me, and i can’t really take it anymore. i worked very hard and didn’t give up that time, but they failed my grades for a foolish reason, that’s why i didn’t have the confidence to take my dream job. most of my teachers will say that i could not succeed in anything because i’m not capable to do anything. so i end up taking the lowest qualifications on my course so that i could go to college, as i finished enrolling on my college i stayed up all night to think about my decision so i decided to tell my mom that i want to withdraw my enrollment and enroll on a different course, but she said no. that made me feel like shit when my mom was talking to my dad mocking about my appearance and i was crying all day. as we were having an ojt on the summer i didn’t feel happy at all, i was doing something that doesn’t thrill me, so i cried in front of my mom begging that i want to change courses because i was unhappy, but she said no because it was my fault that i choose it in the first place, so i acknowledged it, i didn’t mention that in the last 3 years. but when i was having an ojt far away from home, my friends would make me feel bad,blamed me for something i didn’t do. they stole my money and they were making me think that i was delusional. that really strained my emotional quotient that time, as i moved to my next ojt after my ojt that i was home away, the one who has been supervising me told a very bad thing it wasn’t real and that was the reason for my expulsion on my ojt. but i moved forward to complete my remaining days. but one day as i was making our thesis i was chosen to be the leader of my group, everytime when i came home my mom would say unnecessary things that really dragged me down, and she was making me unmotivated about my thesis every moment that she has, but i continued my thesis, and it was completed, while we were presenting my group mates didn’t cooperate to make our presentation successful, i told them that it was their turn to present but they stayed quiet, so i was the only one who was giving a presentation, so that made the jury really mad so they decided to fail us. i had a breakdown and i came home as usual and i was wiping my tears and i was holding it back so that they wouldn’t notice but my mom would say toxic things that i shouldn’t have worked that hard.the next day, i was really exhausted and i ended up waking at 1PM because i didn’t have a sleep for two days. that’s when i received a text message that said that i didn’t cooperate and i was slacking off on the group and it was my fault that my group failed, that moment i was feeling numb and want to die. i decided to go to a therapist but it didn’t helped. i was taking some meds and at that time i was empty inside and i was feeling a lot of anxiety all around me, i isolated myself for a 3 months. then they continued our thesis on our own, but whenever i go to my school i couldn’t stopped myself imaging the angry glares around me, my friends in college are not supportive either. so i go through the hardships and finished my college. a lot of life changing moments have been getting into my life since i graduated college a year ago, i don’t want to write further more, but it seems that i don’t want to exist anymore, i’m literally disgusted with myself everytime i look in the mirror. i just want to end my life.",t2_5gs7617h,4,0

I don't understand myself,"I don't know if this will sound nonsense to some people, but I guess I don't even care anymore. I just think I need to tell someone at some point, instead of just keeping those things to myself my whole life. Idk, maybe it's even pretty common (I hope it is).

I firmly believe that I have some kind of brain defect or something like that. When I was a kid, I remember being a weirdo. I went into places and felt their ""aura"" right away. Some of them were very pleasant, like a piece of heaven on Earth, while others made me feel really uncomfortable. It was kinda like being in a ""dreamy"" state of mind 24/7... like a fantasy world I built for myself, right on top of what is known as ""reality"". When my art teacher showed me ""The Starry Night"" by Van Gogh, I immediately felt like it was hitting really close to home; I could be wrong, but I really believe he (Van Gogh) was trying to translate the ""aura"" he got from that specific place he painted, to the picture itself. Now, I'm no visual artist like Van Gogh of course, I can't even draw tbh, but it just felt as if we'd both understand each other very well (emotionally at least), should we meet somehow.

As I got older, these feelings slowly went away, specially since I'm really bad with words, and can't quite explain to people how I'm feeling sometimes, so I kinda put them aside for the sake of properly communicating with people. I thought everyone hated it when I started talking about those weird feelings I had, so I kinda pretended I was better off without them, up until the point I even forgot about them completely.

But something happened to me, and in a matter of days, I suddenly started remembering everything, and who I was, and who I want to be in life. Like I said, I'm really bad with words, and it feels PAINFUL just to write this post right now. It feels like I'm trying harder than I should. But the fact is, even though I lost those feelings for a while, I don't want them to ever go away. I don't want to ever forget how I used to go into places and suddenly feel like everything was being slowed down to perfection. I don't ever want to forget about how music feels, and about how it wraps me in a piece of heaven every time I listen to it. I don't ever want to forget those weird feelings, even though no one actually understands them except me. I don't want to forget who I am. I wanna go out at 3am for a nightwalk listening to music and being thankful just for being alive. I know that most of what I remember from my very early childhood are vague memories, but they're certainly the most beautiful vague memories I have. I'm sorry I got too caught up, can't write anymore I'm feeling bad and confused rn",t2_17cxep,5,0
Im afraid im gonna give up soon (alcoholism),"Im so sick and tired of fighting it and hurting family and friends. Its all just pain.

My small already broken family being ripped to shreds, my rapist reigning my life for a year, many tragic losses including witnessing the aftermath of a harrowing homicide/suicide, heartbreak after heartbreak, having to leave where I was happiest with my friends suddenly and now my heart condition worsening and my father's health insurance at risk even more now thanks to the stock market crashing.

I made this throwaway since a few people have my main account. Including my most recent ex who's a mess and subsequently making me more of a mess in this trying time.

I think the only reason why I'm not actually killing myself is because I'm scared to do it.,"I'm so lost, so many times during the past couple of months I've went to bed drunk or high early in the afternoon hoping that I will not wake up in the morning. But the last couple of days I've been googling stuff about suicide.

The funny thing is that most people I know keep telling me how amazing my life is. I also happen to have a mildly big social media presence because of my job and keep getting messages by random people saying how much they envy me. If only they knew. I hate myself. I feel like a waste of energy, time and money to everyone that's around me, even my mother (other than my grandmother she's pretty much my whole family). I can't talk to my friends about any of that, I feel like they will either don't believe me or be so embarrassed about me that will just completely abandon me.

And then of course my heart gets broken... I met this girl a couple years ago, a girl that never in a million years should even be in the same room as me. We start spending almost all of our days together, we get super close, I travel around the world to find her, she does the same a couple of times. I tell her how much I love her, how all I really want is to be with her. She feels the same but we're in a weird industry, it doesn't make sense since literally half of the year she's just flying to another random city, she doesn't want to be in a relationship. So we just keep going, doing the same. Somehow seeing other people at the same time but I never really enjoy doing that, it just makes me hate myself even more. She goes away once again, we get closer than ever during that time and when she's back I'm almost certain that we're going to be a couple but also don't want to push anything. So we start spending all our time together again.

Then suddenly couple of weeks ago she starts getting a bit distant. I only see her once a week for 3 weeks in a row... I'm starting to go crazy and at that point I think she's actually falling for someone else. I talked to her about it and she said that it's the same as usual, we always see other people and at this point she's just too busy and stressed and wants to be more friends than 'more than friends' for the time being. But every day we don't spend together and she's with someone else my heard breaks into a million pieces, I get more and more certain that she's slowly fading away. It could all be in my head. I also know that none of this is healthy at all but before I met her I was at a very dark place, for the whole time I've known her she has been my only source of happiness. I think I'm about to lose her and the thought alone makes me want to somehow disappear into nothingness so I can't feel or think anything anymore.

At the end of the day I don't think I'm capable of hurting myself, I'm too scared to do that. And as I'm typing this I feel like I'm wasting the time of people who come here to help others with way more serious issues than mine... but damn I wish I won't wake up tomorrow.",t2_5w64w1qb,4,0

Draft-suicide note,"For the world to know:

Its finally come to this, hasn't it?

My parents are probably going to be confused, as I'm the ""perfect child"" and all. The one with all A's, the funny, sarcastic one... 
I feel kind of bad, but I better explain myself
First things first... dont give me a funeral. They're too expensive and even so, I dont want my death noticed like that. Maybe I want to be noticed and remember, but you'd all just embarrass me at a funeral.

I've got my own reasons for doing this.
I think the most obvious is being an atheist in a crazy mormon family. It makes me want to shoot myself being forced into this. I guess the church isn't all that bad, they do a lot of charity work...its the lack of free will and the whole ideology that you cant transition because it's a sin is hurtful. I dont believe in an afterlife...these 13 years are all I've got...and yet I'm in so much pain that I'm willing to throw it all away. That says something.

People say I'm smart because of how self aware I am. I'm aware of exactly how this may turn out for other people. It's weird.

Another reason is that I'm trans. Some people know this. My dysphoria makes me want to die. I'm forced to watch my body betray me and watch as everything that I know crumbles as I realise that what I am is what I'm not. But I'm too young to know, obviously, and I'm just going to be added to the suicide statistic of trannies who have killed themselves.

One thing that I wish from people is that I'm not forgotten. My name, Adrian Leeroy, wont be spoken after I'm gone. Maybe my dead name will be, which is Madison, but that name makes me dysphoric. Its depressing knowing that all of my experiences, friendships, relationships, emotions, stories, ideas, achievments...they all die with me. They wont be remembered. I won't be remembered. So please, somebody please do something to at least keep my existence out there. Mention my insta, give me a grave, I dont care. I just cant bear the thought of all of this being forgotten.

I have so many stories and ideas and emotional connections, but I guess they go down with me. I have some of my ideas written down in notebooks...some are at my dads, under my bed.

Please don't throw my ideas, my art, or my stuff away. Please dont sell them. I want my objects to still exist to help remember me, if that makes sense. And please dont use my consoles, I guess. I like the idea of them laying dormant, waiting for an owner that will never return... it's weird, but it feels right.

Speaking of, I leave [fatherly figure] my console's, phone, art, stories, etc. He deserves it. Hes helped me a lot with my issues and I'm sorry that he couldn't prevent it.
Also, [bestfriend] can take whatever he wants. Hes done likewise.
My little brother can have my books, I guess.

Some people might think that they could've done more to help me. If you've joked insultingly to me, you haven't affected me. I can take a joke, lots of people know this. If you've been downright mean to me, you can put some blame on your shoulders. I feel bad about that, because I shouldn't have an impact like that...that would be selfish of me to put my burdens on another's shoulders...

Dear my parents, I'm sorry. You guys have controlled me and been anti trans, anti me, your whole life. Dont get too down on yourself, but I feel terrible to inform you that...yeah, you caused some of this...

It's okay to joke about this. You dont have to take me seriously. Joke all you want about how all trans people kill themselves or about how dumb I am or whatever.

Honestly, I kind of did this to prove myself. I can tell that people think that I'm an attention seeker. Some people want me dead anyways. So here's my proof.

I'm also trying to stop the flow of time for me. Right now, my life is decent (which is somewhat ironic). I want it to stay that way. Nobody that I love is gone and I'm still in a school with a mostly great student body. I don't want that to change. I'm scared of the future. So I'm glad to just kind of stop here.

I wonder what the school will do...will they have an assembly? Will they just announce me on the intercom and be done with it? I dont know. I dont care. Just dont forget me.

Dont forget me but make sure to move on, too. Dont dwell on me.

Its sad...I wont be able to feel the sun on my skin, I wont be able to smell the smell of right after rain, I wont be able to taste sweet chocolate, I won't be able to beat that one room in Celeste that was bothering me, I wont be able to listen to Kurianes beautiful music anymore, I wont reach the day where my art looks good to me, I wont see the day where I get 1k updoots , I wont see how my favorite Webtoon ends, I wont see my dogs beautiful eyes and for glisten in the sunlight, and I'll miss out on so many fun little parts of life... but it's worth it, I guess...

I dont want any boomers blaming this on social media, by the way. This has nothing to do with social media. Dont go there.


This is my final goodbye. I love you all and I will miss you a lot...I'm so sorry... i just need to leave this place...I dont belong here...please dont forget my name...",t2_42o4mfuf,6,0

I'm scared,"I'm losing more in life than I'm winning. 

It's hard to keep getting back up after being knocked down so much. Especially when you're knocked down by the people you love. 

I figured out my dream job, after several years of not being confident in mediocre jobs I had planned to go for. I want to be a mortician. Not because it's fun, or I think it'll be cool - I have depression. I have a morbid view on life. Death doesn't scare me because it walks by my side everyday, waiting for me to give in and fall into its arms. I want to help others with their losses. Prepare the deceased, to give them a proper goodbye, and lay them to rest. 

It's not a pretty job. But it's pretty important. 

My boyfriend thinks it's weird. He's grown more comfortable with it, but the thought of him not being proud of me and considering me a freak hurts my heart, just a little. 

I told my dad about my career change tonight, so damn hopeful he'd be proud I figured my shit out and was going for a well-paid career. 

He told me I could never do it. That I'm a woman, that I'm not mentally and physically and emotionally strong enough. That I'm not smart enough for the education. That I can't handle owning my own business. That I should reconsider and pick a real job. 

I feel like I'm losing. Every god damn battle and obstacle. People are pushing me flat on my face and no one is helping me up. They walk over me when I'm done and no one cares. 

Why should I keep going on? Why should I try and live? What is the point if I constantly feel like I'm a failure? Why do I always feel like I shouldn't try to be alive? Why shouldn't I just give up and stop trying to live a life I don't deserve and could probably never maintain?

I just want to end it. I want a painful death. I want to hurt. I want to bleed. I want to scream.

Sitting here trying to talk myself out of killing myself but I can’t find a reason to stay alive anymore.,"I’ve been acting like everything is ok. I’ve been trying to act normal. Been going to work, been doing gigs on the side, watching tv shows.. pretending like everything is ok. 

I’m good one minute. Terrible the next but I can’t fucking take it anymore. I had posted a while ago that I was raped and only found out when I found out I was pregnant. I don’t have a problem with what other women do with their bodies but I didn’t think I could handle having an abortion. I just cried and cried for days because I did t want to have an abortion but I knew I’d resent the child not just about being born but I ducking live in my car.. how the hell was i supposed to have a child and then idk if it’s cause I don’t eat or the stress or maybe my body is just not ready for a child but I had a miscarriage.. and then I thought it was a sign from God. I thought that it might be a blessing and that he was watching out for me.. Having a miscarriage sucks but having it when you’re homeless and living in your car when you don’t have direct access to bathroom is even harder yet I didn’t care because I felt relieved and then guilt set in.. how could I be glad about having a miscarriage? Why would God do that as a good thing.. then I questioned if God was even real and if he wasn’t then there was really no point in being alive. And then I talked myself out of it. I thought things could get better.. people here on reddit were so nice and caring and I thought maybe just maybe I’d be ok.. 

I went back to pretendint everything was fine.. Working to get out  of my situation but every single time I felt like I was saving up, my grandma would get sick and there went my money. I feel like no matter what I do I’m never getting out.

I just miss my parents.. I want someone to just love me and be there for me and then I feel responsible because maybe if I would’ve taken care of myself, I wouldn’t have had a miscarriage and then I’d have someone that loves me unconditionally. Everyone I’ve ever been there for has used me up and then thrown me away but maybe that child wouldn’t have. 

And then I tell myself people have it worse and it makes me try for a day or two but then out of no where I’ll go back to feeling this way and then I’ll snap out of it.. but not this time. 

My rapist came up with the money and was bonded out this morning. No one even bothered to tell me until an hour ago. I stupidly went on his Instagram to see if une posted anything and his friends are tagging him in pictures. They fucking threw him a welcome party.. a rapist gets that... meanwhile here I am alone in my fucking car trying to talk myself out of killing myself. 

Idk what I did to have this life? The only thing keeping me alive is that my grandma would be homeless but then I wonder if maybe she’ll find her way out. Idk I just don’t want to be alive anymore.

Help me. Please,"I don’t know what to do, and I’m really fucking scared.

Background:

I’m a 15 year old guy, with an estranged abusive father and an overbearing, manipulative, yet somewhat supportive mother. I have two older sisters who I struggle trusting because everything I say to them gets repeated back to my mother. My older brother (essentially my best friend even though we fought as brothers do) hung himself when I was 11 and I still see him in that position to this day, when I and my mother found him. I live only with my mum and have had a fairly bad mental state and have been teetering on the edge a bit, due to an oppressive school, stress, insecurities, circumstances, and my sexuality. (See post history). I refuse to see a counsellor as I have before and that’s just not how I like dealing with my emotions

This post isn’t about me though.

My first cousin, who was really close to my older brother and me, recently tried to commit suicide by driving off of a cliff. I only see him once/twice a year but we get along really well, and have really good conversations. I don’t really get along with any of my family on my father’s side but he’s different. 

I heard about it about 2 hours ago from my Grandmother. I don’t like how she told us behind his back because I know how that feels but I understand that she’s just worried. I need advice on how to show support for him. I really care about him, but I don’t want to make him feel like he’s only loved when he’s trying to commit suicide if you know what I mean. We live about an hour away from each other, and I can’t drive so I’ve considered catching a train to see him but I don’t know if that’s a good idea. He’s not seeking professional help yet either.

I have a plan but I wanna know if it gets better,"I really don't know why I'm posting this here. But anyway.

The reason I'm gonna kill myself is because I keep hurting the people I love and who love me. There's this one person who really unconditionally loves me but I hurt that person anyway because of my own insecurities and mental bullshit going on.

The thing is, I've tried to be better. I did my best to change myself, to be mindful of my reactions, but when it actually counts, I keep disappointing myself and others. I keep hurting them. And I keep apologising and saying I'll do better, but I never do. And it all feels out of my control because once that part of my mind takes over, all rational thought is gone.

I'm just tired. I'm tired of trying and failing. I'm tired of hurting others while I'm trying to change myself for the better because yes, we all make mistakes, but there are unforgivable ones. Ones we can't take back. And sometimes it happens even when we're trying our best to be better.

I don't think I'll ever be okay. I can try to, but there will always be another fight, another incident, that will end up in me hurting others, and it's gonna be the same conversation and apology.

People are gonna get tired of it, too. I know for sure. Even the ones who love me unconditionally will get tired of it. I know because it already happened.

To stop all this, maybe this is the answer. Ending it all. I have no other reason to live. I may have a good career path and a nice financial future (I'm graduating this year), but what's the point in all that if I don't have anyone to live for? And even if I did, what's the point if all I do is inevitably hurt them? I can't live for myself because I'm tired of dealing with my own bullshit. It's easier this way.

Btw, therapists and the like aren't very accessible in my country. I dont have the same resources most of you do, so if you do, please take the opportunity and get help. All this time I only have myself and Internet resources to try and help me, and that's all I can have.

So there. I wanna get it out there that I have a plan. I'm jumping off my high rise apartment on Saturday once all my roommates go home for the weekend.

I've had problems with a past ex-boyfriend for the last 2 years. And today, I lost my job. I seem to lose things a lot. And don't know what to do about it. My depression is so bad I feel like its slowly going to win. I've thought about how I could end my life. But, I don't know how. At least the pain would be better than what I feel now. 

This is going to get gruesome. But, I was thinking of just slitting my throat and letting myself bleed out and suffocate. Life isn't for me. It's not. It hates me. Just like everyone else in my life, except maybe those two friends and my family. But, again.. I'm stubborn. And I don't care how they feel. 

Maybe that makes me a selfish asshole as well, but, I'm tired. I love someone who hates me. Who thinks I'm a psycho and thinks I'm a stalker. Maybe I sort of am. But, I just wanted honesty. And... I didn't get that. I got lies and I got replaced. And no by one. By *many* women. It hurts. 

Losing my job made me feel like a failure. But, he fed my depression and my suicidal thoughts. I won't go into detail about the things my ex has said and done to me. Of course, he's never physically abused me. I'm glad for that. No, what he did was 10000x ***worse*** he mentally, emotionally, and verbally abused me. As well as I have done to him. 

*I'm no saint.* I know this. All I ever wanted was true love from him. And to be married. To have a family. I wanted that when I was with him. He didn't. It's been a ***year*** since we've been broken up. And I'm still in pain, and even worse pain knowing that he wants marriage and a family now that we aren't together. 

I know people will say ""maybe you weren't his one. Or he wasn't yours."" I believe we weren't meant to be. And I know you can't force things. But, I truly loved him. And I still do. When I wished that I didn't.

I'm still here, though. I don't want to be. And I've been going by this motto I made up myself..

I don't want help, I don't want medication, I don't want therapy, I feel like the only comforting thing is suicide. I hate hearing it's never the answer, but it's definitely one of the better ones.

I hate money. I hope coronavirus kills me.,"Honestly. I'm in so much debt because my ex used my name for things, I have no friends and now I'm way too scared to make new friends because she told the few people in my life to begin with I abused her when I didn't and no one bothered to fact check with her or me and just believed her, I was molested as a child and bullied most of my life, I'm just convinced that what everyone said about me being ugly and stupid must be true because I sure haven't heard many people say I'm smart or handsome. I just don't stand a chance in this society (US society specifically).


I waste money my family doesn't have for extra food and gas, we have finally gotten out of homelessness after 10+ years and we are so close to going back to being homeless it isn't right. It hasn't even been a year since we got out of it. If I wasn't around things would be better. I can't save any money because I spend it all helping them with rent and stuff because I suck up their income with needing food and them to drive me to work every day, I can't even spend it on the debt I have because I make minimum wage even though I have certain specific knowledge, skills and years experience yet no one wants to hire me. I work 6-7 days a week and still don't make enough to save. I don't have friends so I don't go out. I distance myself from my co-workers on purpose like an idiot because even though they are nice I am so scared of making friends and then them just betraying me like when my ex told them a lie and they believed her as well as so many other instances in the past. I don't smoke/vape or drink at all, I wouldn't know the first thing about how or where to get drugs either so it's not like I'm spending money or time on random stuff like that. I spend most of my free time sleeping hoping I don't wake up.


The only thing I look forward to is seeing my current girlfriend. She's the only friend that stuck around and come to find she had liked me a very long time and believed me over my ex. I don't know why she likes me and I liked her too but didn't think she liked me so I stupidly dated someone abusive and manipulative instead, but I am happy that someone like her loves me. I love her so much but I know I am a burden to her. I have bad credit from my ex using my name for some bills without telling me when we were together and such. I don't see how anyone can afford a house here in America unless they are making something like 70-80k+ with flawless credit and I can't even make 25k and can't get a better job because no one wants to hire me even though I have the knowledge to work in a specific field where I could be making 40-50k at least. I don't have a car and can't save for one and don't have money to renew my license anyways. If I could live in a different country like in Scandinavia or something I would but traveling and making enough money and finding the time to somehow gain citizenship sounds very expensive also.

I work somewhere where there are thousands of people that pass through daily, I hope I catch the coronavirus and die. I can't own a gun and kill myself, but if I could things would be better for everyone. My family might be sad for a bit but they won't be spending unnecessary money on me and be homeless. My girlfriend is smart, kind and amazing and is able to go places. I would never do anything to hurt her, and while I know my death would sadden her deeply I feel as though I have nothing to offer her. I can only give her my love and happiness, I can't help us get and afford a home or afford food or do anything for long term security so we can live happily and safely. Not to say it's all up to me because she would be doing what she could for me too, but for where I am and always have been in life no matter how hard I try to do anything to change it I would just be an expense to her that can't give her my 50% to making sure our future is secure. We've talked about having kids in the future and in my head I know that if we did I would just be a let down to them... I couldn't offer them the happy future they deserve, especially in this world where it's okay to destroy the climate for a bit of profit and eventually make the world uninhabitable anyways. The last thing I want is for her (and if we had kids) to be homeless with no hope for the future too. This whole world runs on stupid money, I honestly hate the concept of money and wish we could run the world off trade and knowledge or something. It's one of the biggest issues I have with being alive. 


TL;DR-
I hate being alive I hope coronavirus kills me. I have no friends and I'm generally unlikeable and just a burden to the few people in my life. Money is stupid and it hurts that I can't afford to keep myself and the people I care about out of poverty and help us all be happy, healthy and be able to actually enjoy being alive.",t2_5f2gklxo,18,0

The notion of gender INequality often leads me to suicide.,"I'm not from North America, but from a relatively more conservative country, so the context may be different.  I would like to remain gender neutral in this post to protect myself and so that the post benefits everyone.  I'd also like to make my position clear.  I'm a feminist and misanthrope, so in a nutshell I hold certain cynical/pessimistic opinions about everyone equally and I want equality for everyone.  My opinions do not skew towards certain demographics, hence I am not a misogynist, misandrist, incel, femcel, or a bigot.

I often go down this particular rabbit hole of thought when a notion of gender inequality that is perceivably severe, applies to me, and hurts me, comes up.  Either I read/hear about it or my brain just induces it.  It just hits me really personally.  The notion leads to crippling stress and self-hate, especially towards my biological sex.  I would occasionally be unable to concentrate for an entire day, which affects my work and studies.  I would sometimes go into a panic attack.  I would constantly go over with myself: ""I hate my biological sex, I wish I were the opposite sex, being the opposite sex would have made my life better in this regard, why was I born as this biological sex?, why was I even born?, I/my existence/my biological sex is wrong.""  Which leads to depression and anxiety, like self-hate, and ""am I even doing anything right?, why do I deserve this life?, I'm worthless, nobody loves/cares about me.""  I once cried in bed and the shower because of all this and wishing I was the opposite sex.  Which then ultimately leads to self-harm and suicidal ideation.  I once planned my suicide months in advance in case I wanted to quickly escape from this reality, but I never used it.  Obviously, it has left me with trauma that still accumulates, and a numb feeling when it comes to anything I used to enjoy.

I constantly feel this way, but I've only recently found a few ways to cope, and I'm just slowly getting used to the pain.  For example, I have gone on a gender role strike, in that I refuse to do anything stereotyped to my biological sex because I hate my biological sex and don't want anyone to pursue me based on that, and refuse to do anything stereotyped to the opposite sex because it feels like something exclusive and I just don't feel like the opposite sex.  It makes me feel better, but it also means I'm hardly doing anything that isn't perceived as gender-neutral.  I also think I'm transgender.  I have gender dysphoria, but unlike trans people whose dysphoria is biological, mine seems to come from trauma and personal experiences, like I believe I was born in the wrong body not because of a mismatch between my brain and body, but because ""I was born in the wrong body because it's wrong to have this kind of body according to myself and society.""  I enjoy trans memes and hanging out with the community.  I get euphoria from feeling, looking, and acting stereotypically like the opposite sex.  I also relate to the typical experiences of being transgender, like relating to the opposite gender more, wanting to fit in with them, etc.  I get jealous of the opposite gender too.

What's worse is I have no-one close I feel comfortable talking about this to.  I found that both women and men generally just continue to live their lives, embracing their birth identity, and thinking such inequality is trivial.  Gender essentialism is very rampant here.  I have been abused, physically, emotionally, and sexually, by both women and men, and I just feel like nobody cares about me or my struggles, let alone equal rights.  When I brought these issues up to my mum, she thought I was overreacting about something ""so trivial.""  Everyone just seems to trivialise issues I think are severe, and nobody's really speaking up.  And I don't know if moving to another country that has more gender equality will help me with these issues, as people will see me as a human being with ambitions and feelings rather than a walking genital, and people won't take advantage of me based on something I cannot control, like my biological sex.

Is it normal to feel suicidal about gender **in**equality?  What can I do?  Am I transgender or just really traumatised and looking for an escape?  Is my gender dysphoria, being mostly a social one, legitimate?",t2_3v1rxar6,3,0

She has been drinking and driving which is out of character for her, she totaled her car 10 days ago because she tried to kill her self by getting ran over by a train, hit something else instead and came home freaking out. she spent a week in behavior health where she definitely played her cards right and got out in a week. She acted like her normal self and said she had felt much better. We were still watching her and  being cautious but she is 19 and still needs her space. fast forward 3 days later she drove my dads car since hers in totaled. She drove way out to the country, and drove on a back highway (the 2 lane with no street lights no sign of nothin kind of back highways)  and drove off the road! she rolled over the car multiple times until landing in a tree. she crawled out and got help as she only suffers from whiplash now, thankfully. that car is destroyed and crushed to nothing. no one including any medical staff understand how she survived. as soon as she got to the hospital she said she wants to die again.

I’ve attempted suicide 4 times now and I don’t know what to do anymore. My friends have all left, my boyfriend is getting sick of me, my family wants nothing to do with me. I just want to be loved. I just want someone to talk to and not judge what I say and actually genuinely care.",t2_3jij9xqh,13,0
Explaining myself. A suicide note,"I'm done. I'm completely done. I can't take it anymore. These past few weeks have been the worst. the worst. 

I cry every time I go to sleep, I wake up with suicidal thoughts, started self harming again, battling battles with inner me is again a problem. On one side I wanna end it on the other I try to find hope and a better good. Well honestly I'm done battling, I gave up.

I got called selfish so apparently all my effort was worthless. 

This thursday I'm back home. I'll run off my third period and end it all downtown. I'll run off school grounds to go downtown where I'll end it. On my way downtown I'll be fucking wasted so I feel less like shit. I've made my decision. 

The past 5 months have showed me that even you try your best it's not enough. I didn't self harm, I got into a relationship with a person I absolutely love, got better grades, had fewer suicidal thoughts but that just made my fall worse.

To everyone I've known: I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough to be here by your side right now

Bye ♡,"This is a goodbye to all of the people here, specially every one that I talked to.

You were all so kind and lovely to me. Thank you for each one of you that cared, that messaged me, that tried to help. You are all so nice. All of the things you wtote to me meant the world.
You made me feel better in bad moments and made me feel loved and real a lot of times. I'm really thankful.

To the kind and lovely people that I talk here, I love you all so much. You are so important to me. Thank you for making my days better and for giving me good moments. You made it easier for me to live here. 
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell bye to each of you, it would just worry you more. 
Just please, know that you matter the world and I want all of you to be happy.

If you are reading this, whoever you are, thank you, too. I know things are hard. I don't know your pain, but I know it will get better. Things change everytime, maybe for better. Don't give up on trying. 
You are all so, so strong. You will be fine. 

I hope you can feel fine and happier with time. I'm sending you a big hug and lots of love. Always remember that there's someone who cares. 

I'm sorry if I'm hurting you with this. I'll be fine now. I'll be in peace. I hope you can find peace here on earth. It just wasn't possible to me, but it can be to you.

I love you. Thank you for reading, if you did. ♡",t2_p5opk0,241,0

I'm going to kill myself on the 25th of april,"I'll be 16 on the 25th, the reason i decided i will do so is because of a poem i love by Alvaro de campos where he writes something in the manner of ""people will only miss you twice a year, on the day of your death and on the day of your birth, only twice a year people will sigh in grief in the rememberence of you"" Which made me think it'll be logical to narrow it down to one day in the year",t2_2uhtukhf,2,0

I'm in a really bad place and I can't seem to get out of it. It's unbearable.,My mind is constantly thinking about suicide all day. Every day. It has been for about seven years. I've seen all the therapists and tried all the medications. I've tried all the lifestyle changes and alternative therapies. I am so stuck I am so bad I am so helpless. My brain is so empty and numb. If you scanned my head you'd probably find that my brain had disappeared. Everything hurts. I don't fit in anywhere and nothing can help me. I am desperate for relief from this and I have been searching for so long to find solutions and nothing ever comes from them. Spent thousands and traveled many miles and it has all felt pointless. Fuck seriously I hate all this so fucking much it's UNBEARABLE and it doesn't go away. I can't cry as I'm too numb. I've been told that I am developing schizophrenia though it feels like I have every mental illness there is. I feel doomed. I can't take this. There are no options left as I have tried everything that is legal. I have been to the hospital and they chat to me then send me home. It's hopeless. I don't know what to do I am so scared of suicide and it's always on my mind you know? I don't know what else to say. It feels unbearable and it's so upsetting to always be like this.,t2_17gze7,4,0

I should either be dead or have made something of myself by now.,"Just about wrapping up my birthday, finally have a chance alone to be me again. I'm now 23. I only know because someone told me, I stopped keeping track a long time ago. I can't be bothered to count how long it has been since I graduated, but I know it's only 2 ish months until I lap myself.10 months then. I should have at least a job by now, or have already killed myself by now. I don't understand why I can't pick a street here. Both are well within my means and capabilities, but I can't bring myself to do either one. If I play my cards right, the two aren't even exclusive either. I always planned to get a job, save every cent I was given, pay my parents back the cost of raising me, then kill myself. I figured if I got a good enough job and only bought less than the bare essentials, I could be dead in a ditch within 5-10 years. That plan went out the window when I found I couldn't force myself to apply to any jobs, let alone look for them. New plan: Kill myself as soon as possible so my family could cut their losses and move on. Every time I turn on a light, I'm costing them more money and delaying their retirement. Either way I save my parents more un needed pressure supporting me. But I don't and now I'm sitting here because I'm too lazy to do anything. I'm too lazy to even remember where I was going with this.",t2_832du,1,0
It’s gonna happen soon. I know it.,"I told my parents I was suicidal almost 2 weeks ago. You know what they did? Nothing. The only people keeping me alive have made it clear they don’t give a shit. Not a single person to confide in. And if I reference how I feel, I’m either completely ignored, or get snitched on to the counselor. My mental state is crumbling and grim. It’s just a downward spiral. I’m destined for this. I know it. See you bastards on the other side.",t2_1qdq1dis,105,0

I'm really not emotionally capable of having friends.,"Seriously. I'm too sensitive for my own good. If a friend of mine messages me something to let me know about something I'm doing wrong I literally just go into breakdown mode. 

I can't stop thinking of that time two years ago, when someone I thought was my best friend told me they had lied all that time I knew them and they never cared about me or the things I made. I can't take any chances. If a friend and I have a disagreement I immediately assume that they never cared about me or anything I said to them in the first place and that I'm a dumbass for even trying to trust again. But yet I don't blame them. I do impulsive things when I'm in a depressive and panicked state; not self harm but more like I just burn the bridges even harder than I should. I leave group chats and say shit I don't mean. 

I've had this my entire life. I've waited for so long to see when it ""gets better"" and I have lived through depression in childhood all the way through to adulthood and it never did get better. It's getting worse, even, with work and college draining my very being. 

I pray to whatever's out there every single day that I die in my sleep or from sickness or something that would be deemed not my own doing. I can't do that to my family; I can't have them living with the guilt if I killed myself. But I am close to doing it, and I will make it look like an accident.",t2_xqfqv8e,1,0

The incongruity and absurdity of life,"People are so cavalier about life until it comes to suicide. Death goes on around us all the time in ways much more tragic than suicide. At least suicidal people want to kill themselves, starving people have no choice. How can society say they care about life with regards to suicidal people but turn their back on other forms of death.

I feel like I'm going to kill myself by the end of the year,"For background, I'm 33 years old. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I'm on antidepressants, which I take regularly, and which allow me to actually function. I've been seeing a therapist for 4 years, and she's helped me deal with my past traumas. I started my first real job in January. It's a good job. I can finally afford to live on my own and pay off my student loans. This is what I've been wanting for years, and I finally have it.

But I feel closer to suicide than ever.

Now that I'm self-sufficient and at peace with myself, I just feel like there's really nothing to live for. I only have one real interest, and it makes me sad more often than not. I haven't been interested in relationships for years.

But the biggest problem is that I feel like there's no future. Honestly, the state of the world being what it is, I wish I'd killed myself years ago just to spare myself the constant grief. It's so bad that my family knows they can't talk about current events around me or I'll just crumple and be pretty much uncommunicative for hours. I just don't particularly want to spend whatever years I have left watching everything slowly die. I have no hope at all that things will get better.

My suicidal feelings come in waves. I feel relatively cheerful most of the time, but the urge is always there in the back of my mind. When it overtakes me, I spend hours unable to do anything but cry. I call the suicide hotline when I'm having a particularly bad episode, and they're able to talk me through it about half the time. (The rest of the time they're so mind-bogglingly incompetent that it distracts me enough to shake it off for a while.) My counselor hasn't been able to help with this issue at all, but I also haven't told her how bad it really is because I'm afraid of being hospitalized.

I actually had a health scare very recently and ended up in the ER, where I was basically told that my life was at risk, and I felt almost excited by the prospect. It was the first time I'd felt hopeful for something in years. But it's behind me now.

I cry when I think about leaving my family to deal with my death, but that's really the only thing holding me back. I'm just so, so tired.",t2_5w628t5q,1,0

There’s not really any point in living with schizophrenia is there.,"I’m in the prodormal phase of SZ. Unfortunately I have enough insight and intelligence to realise that my self is inevitable to fragmentation. My ego is trapped in the room of a flooding ship, drowning amidst the tide of unconscious forces. Everyday it gets a worse, my entire visual experience feels ingenuine, artificial, like a copy of the world. I’m not immersed. And it feels like I’m viewing myself viewing this artificial world. 

This explains why I am able to drink 20 beers or take 10 tabs of acid and still be able to act like nothing happened. It’s horrible and there really is no escape.

My personality is so eccentric I struggle to relate to the everyday man. I see threads of reality that no one else sees, I’ve done things in life that very few people of done. Yet due to my illness I appear stupid, nervous. I can’t smile due to a flat face so nobody wants to be friends with me. And slowly I can feel my self being eaten by something that isn’t reflective of me at all.

I will not have my life hinge on horrible medications. I would like to be able to work with universities and share my personal experience for studies but I feel like that’s a lot of effort because I’d have to go to the states or Europe to do that.

The “meaning” of life question could be answered pretty easily if you learn philosophy,"No offense, I know this is not related to helping suicide prevention, but you do know that if you went to college they teach you about philosophy and the “meaning” of life right? I’m just sitting here reading a lot of this while other doesn’t realize the answer is literally right in front of them when you can go to a good college that teach you about the meaning of life and other things that are similar to it, the answer was discovered about 100 years ago, I’ll just give you the fast answer, it might not make sense since you didn’t get the whole explanation here:

1- accept that it’s all meaningless, even if it is meaningless to accept it, and just be human

2-It’s meaningless nothing matter, do whatever the fuck you want

3-distract yourself with distractions, distract yourself with anything you can find

4-suicide 

5-life is meaningless that’s the meaning of life, that it is meaningless 

6-the nature meaning of life is to have sex and make children, that’s why love is a chemical, it’s natural way of manipulating you to have sex, that’s why you work, to get money to survive so you can have sex, that why your attracted to smart and beautiful people, so you can get those traits to your children, human is like any virus, it does anything to survive, that’s why people are very greedy creature

Also, some of the methods above only work if you still have  enough energy to get out of bed and do it, also if you think the “meaning of life” question were hard to be answered then I think It would surprised our that philosopher come up with answers everyday for it, just like the   Answer to why humans are greedy creatures but are actually not, here’s a fast answer: “almost all of the violence and crime around the world is caused by anxiety, insecurity’s and fear, I know it might not makes sense but like I said, if you want to get over you view of “everything is bad and humans are greedy creature or life is meaningless” I suggest you go learn more about it, also that should help you with some feeing if despair, but after you change your mid set, the only thing you need to face left is real depression, which is the hardest the to over come, the only thing I can really say is, get anti-depression or wait for that drug that is being work on to “cure all depression and stress” which would probably take forever to make it might never be made, since it’s basically the chemical that makes you happy, I think",t2_5ke00nji,1,0

Male) sick and tired of being bullied because I’m ugly...,"- [ ] I’m Male 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) long legs short torso  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin. When I was younger I was small faced in proportion to my body so it was fine. Now I’m older my head lols too big for my body. .And now more than ever I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. Every night getting drunk alone. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help (a steward) . I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something . but other times it’s not easy on my mental health as sometimes ppl stare at me for longer than normal and not look away and it’s 99% girls who do this (no it’s not the good kind of stares I’m 100% sure)  one night one girl in a queue stared at me facially then grimaced me down and she was like 4ft. , I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking with a disgusted look on his face. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly (I once overheard him refer to me as a ‘creature’ to his friend) he stares at every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s when he’s talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. I now have to wear a beanie and a snood to cover myself up and guess what? The stares stopped. Being stared down because I’m tall and slim happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder and now my face has gotten fat. I don’t ever wanna leave the house Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened 2 hours in to a shift? I mean cmon can I get a break. My dad said to me a few months ago ‘it bothers me that youv never had the love of a good woman, it’s a crying shame, it must bother you’ and I just shrugged and said ‘I’m too ugly’ which I am. I wake up every morning with suicidal thoughts crying and replaying the ppl calling me ugly over and over again in my head. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to because I’ll just get bullied and treated like shit. Especially by girls who can fraud their faces with makeup and won’t leave the house without it on but judge me because I’m ugly. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it’s because I’m ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I’m sick and  tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally everytime. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years ago in 2014-2015  I worked in a nice bar in a good posh area and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl I worked with had a crush on me and let me know. but she will be the only girl who will ever like me, it will never happen again. I think about killing my self everyday. Thanks for reading. If you’re attractive, good for you. enjoy it.",t2_5w4c4zlq,1,0

Can't break of isolation,"I started to isolate from people almost two years ago, and I'm still trapped on it.

I'm like Ishida from A Silent Voice, I can't trust people like I used to, years of losing friendships, mistakes and conflicts have maimed my heart a lot... If I don't change, the people who gave me a chance to reconnect will eventually move on...

It doesn't help that I think that most people who still think I have Asperger's (misdiagnosed), will see me as an eternal acquaintance/classmate, so my chances to become friends or reconnect with them are very small...

I’ve started to fantasize about my death,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons, but as of late I’ve started thinking about ways that it could all end for me. I don’t really imagine doing it to myself all that often but every time I’m walking on a sidewalk I think about stepping onto the road and just waiting for a car to run over me so that it can all be over. I’ve tried voicing my concerns to my friends and family but no one seems to be taking me seriously, and for those who do, they seem to be getting tired of having to deal with my venting all the time. I catch myself thinking during class (I’m a college student) what if I die right here right now and left all of this behind. It won’t matter in 100 years anyways, since all the people I’d have left behind would be long gone and they themselves forgotten. I don’t know why these intrusive thoughts are happening since, at times, things seem to be going objectively well for me provided I stick to my normal routine and current track in life—but there’s this self destructive side of me that just wants to throw it all away just to get rid of all the obligations I have and start over socially. I have a lot of people that like me for the personality that I portray but when I’m in one of my more depressive episodes that starts to feel a lot like a mask that I’m forced to wear having pretended to be a carefree and funny guy this whole time. Sorry for the long post, I don’t necessarily feel like I need advice or anything, I just really needed to vent anonymously.",t2_5w3rb9ox,2,0

I wish I could go on but nothing is motivating me to stay alive not even my kid anymore. I just want to say sorry to everyone life that I have ruined and have been a burden to. I have made up mind and nothing can change it. All that keeps happening in my life is complete let down and heart break and when I thought I couldn’t get any lower in life, life said ha bitch think again and dragged to the fucking bottom and there is no way to get back up. Sometimes I wish the one person that I would talk to would see this but I have a better chance finding a Bigfoot. Please people if you know someone that only talks to you about feeling like this listen to them and don’t cut them off, she could of listen or wrote back but instead ignored me and broke me broke me so bad the peace’s are to broken to put back together.

Well I guess this is it,"I tried to be optimistic. I’ve been unemployed since January, relying on my parents to take care of me and my daughter who I have sole custody of. It took almost two months to get my first interview. I have yet to receive another one, even though I apply to at least two jobs per day, and have since I became unemployed. I was informed today, two weeks after the fact, that I didn’t get the job. I’m over it at this point. Why would good things happen to me, that would be too easy. My daughter is going to be staying with her mom for a few weeks starting next week so I’ll probably do it then. 

Before anyone says “think of your daughter” or “think about this person” or “think about that person”

I’m fully aware I’m making a selfish decision. My daughter is 3 so she’ll forget me soon enough. My parents are aware I’m suicidal but they really aren’t doing much. They’re only giving me money because I have my daughter. I don’t really have any friends, and the few I do have, I’m not even close to their top priority friends. I’m just that guy that shows up to play magic and makes funny self deprecating jokes. The girl I thought I had a thing with doesn’t have feelings for me, so why bother? I’m $65000 in debt ($59000 now that they took my entire tax refund). All of my possessions are maybe worth $1000. Why try? At this point there’s literally no reason to.

Suicidal Thoughts Everyday @ Work,"I don't know why, but everyday I go to work in the poultry industry I think about hanging myself in the garage. If I quit I run out of money before I can get disability. Disability could take years. I don't have years. I'm young, but I can't manage to get up for work everyday and do the simplest job packing line work. You talk to someone you are in trouble. Don't get me started on the reverse racism, so surprised. Being drilled about my performance when all I think about is how much I would rather kill myself than continue working there. The feelings are getting so strong I may have missed too many days to go back at this point anyway. My parents poured so much love in me and I'm 30 about to be homeless again and really need disability... I know that I can't keep working under these conditions my mind isn't right I'm so depressed. I get along with people on the job, people tend to like me. But, I'm not all that attractive anymore and I feel like if I looked good I'd be better off. So I keep looking at surgeries to get and I see that they are expensive dermabrasion is like 5k or more... But even if I get all these things I know I won't be happy with myself. I feel so ugly I want to die a lot.

Ism what to do meds and therapy only work so much. Its like everything stopped working.

If Bernie Loses I Will Have no Future Worth Living for,"I thought things were going well. Bernie was on track to get the nomination as early as Super Tuesday and I would have a future worth living. He'd win, get M4A passed and cancel my unfair student loans I was forced to take. Then came Obama, too deceitful and cowardly to outright endorse Biden, talking with Pete and Amy to consolidate the moderate vote while Elizabeth Warrens stayed in and cost Bernie a win in 5 states: Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Texas, giving Biden a lead and the MSM the ability to generate more and more undeserved momentum for Soupbrain Biden. Now I seriously have to wonder if I will have a future. We have 10 years to lower emissions to stop the worst case scenario of Climate Change according to the IPCC. 10 years. After which it will be guaranteed there will be mass amounts of migration around the world and a lower amount of vital resources needed for life such as arable land and drinking water that will lead to societal collapse. Bernie is the only one who can get our country on track to even have a chance of stopping it. 

Even if this was not the case and I wouldn't be forced to live through a climate-induced collapse of civilization, my life would be hell. I'd be stuck in student loan debt because I wasn't born into a rich family. In addition, as a transgender person, this debt and lack of health insurance would make it impossible to transition until I am in a better financial situation, which would be too old for me to ever pass (ie not look like a guy in a dress to the average person). I know people will say ""what about 2024""?, but that won't happen, because NO ONE is going to have the same appeal as Sanders for a generation at least. The appeal needed to create a broad coalition to win. Even then, 2024 would also be too late and I'd be stuck having to watch the world die due to climate change. There is no future worth living without Bernie Sanders winning the nomination and the Presidency. If Biden wins because Obama and the establishment couldn't let the people not be broke and stuck on a dying planet, I'm going to kill myself. I almost did so on Super Tuesday, so I'm pretty sure I can do so if Trump is set for a second term by the establishment's dirty tricks. Hell, if it's another bad night for Sanders tomorrow, I might try and drown myself again.",t2_1uhe7a5z,6,0

Drowning in the beach,"I listen to tango. This specific tango always comforts me, it has something warm about it. I have rarely felt comfortable. Life has been more discomfort. Perhaps that is why Argentina enchanted me and enchants me today. Tango brings me comfort, it brings me heat: why wouldn't Argentina (or Uruguay) have the same effect?

I'm still lonely. I continue a thousand things. But now I'm a freshman of Portuguese Literature at the glorious Federal University of Santa Catarina. I care about rankings so I went to see where the little princess of Trindade was and we are (we are? I'm hardly a freshman) the twenty-second in Latin America. I remained sad. Perhaps rankings are not that important.

I thought maybe I was going to be hospitalized last week. Fortunately, I wasn't. Because I tried to kill myself recently, they infer that soon I will have to try again. The psychiatrist did not want to leave the medication with me. I said that I wasn't crazy about trying something new with medication. I have the recipes.

I don't even know more than to complain. Yes, I am lonely. I've always been lonely. I didn't have most of the experiences of an ordinary teenager. I have a few friends. I never went to their homes. Maybe I don't have friends. My family is dysfunctional and I learned what suicide means from an early age. I talked to my mom last week and I almost had an anxiety attack.

I tried to contact almost everyone. It was not a success. I felt even more lonely.

Things should have improved. I moved to another city. I recited my poems at a bar. I'm almost a college student now. But now I can only remember that once an Australian Prime Minister went to dive into the sea and never came back. And I think it’s not that unusual.

"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized.

Tonight I'm going to die.,"I'm tired. I'm supposed to leave for work in 2 hours or so. But, I'm not going. And because of it, I'll be fired. My depression has gotten the best of me and has won. I'm going to die. No matter how long it takes, or what I have to do to make it happen. It's going to happen. So, guess I'll write goodbye letters to people who matter to me even though I'm sure they wont see it. 

Family: To my family.. my mother, my father, my sister, my brother.. and others whom are related to me. Thank you for raising me to know what love was. Unfortunately, that was taken away from me as well as my dignity and I'm miserable. I'll miss all of you. My main family especially. I love you all and hope you know that you guys were honestly my best friends. My everything. But I just wasn't strong enough for you and I'm sorry. 

To my friend: (Al, is what we will call her.) I've known you for 15 or more years and you've done so much for me over those years. We were so close we were practically sisters. I hope that you will not miss me too much. But, know that I love you and hope that you and your boyfriend make it to where you want in life. Because I know I havent. So, good luck with your life, and thank you for everything. 

To my Ex-Boyfriend (C) : C, I've never loved anyone as much as I have loved you. You showed me a love I'd never gotten before. Until you stopped. And gave it to others. More than one person got your love, and over time... I became dust. Regardless of the pain you put me through, the loyalty I still had for you even to this day, I don't regret. Which, yeah, it's going to make no sense because i do, however... regret speaking to you. I never would have had to endure so much pain on top of all my depression and anxiety if I'd never spoken to you. I loved you, yeah. I still do. I dont regret dating you, i dont regret loving you, nor do I regret knowing you. But, I really do regret speaking to you. I would've been so pain free if I'd never have spoken to you. Lying and cheating on someone is very harsh and painful to ones heart. But, even after all that you've done and said to me. I still love you. And I hope you know now, that you can, and will be free after tonight.. so, good luck with your life. I hope you get to where you wish to be. 

Anyone else I've not mentioned, just know those whom are close to me I love dearly. I'm 22, almost 23 years old. And I'm tired. Im drained and I am going to say that I'm deeply sorry for doing what I've done. Or am going to accomplish tonight. I wont make it to 23, because my birthday is May 29th. 

Im sorry. To everyone who has had to know me. Im deeply sorry. I'll be a solved problem very soon.

"I am so lucky with my life circumstances, but I was born with a very sick mind. I just don't understand why it had to be like this","I'm 22 years old.  I have become self aware of everything wrong with me in the past few months. I have realized I am likely a covert malignant narcissist. I have always been quiet/shy/introverted but I have done awful things in the past that have significantly hurt people close to me. I had “forgiven” myself for these things but I realized some of these things are quite insidious and unforgivable. Even though I’d never want to do them again it’s always going to follow me, and it will probably catch up to me eventually and I’ll end up in prison. I have some antisocial/psychopathic and sadistic traits that have shocked me to come to terms with. It’s useless to label myself though. I’m just fucked up

I think I definitely am on the autistic spectrum too. I’ve talked to myself my whole life, I am in my own little world. I have full on conversations with myself even in public sometimes, and I’m so bad in social situations and always come off as awkward because I literally cannot listen or relate to people. I have very specific and obsessive interests that most people don’t care about.  I have made great friends in the past but now that I've graduated college I've lost them all, I got insecure about my unemployment and job prospects so I cut everyone off.  And made them more worried about me

I also have horrible ADHD/focus/impulse control. When I was young I would be in karate class but just sit in the corner and roll around and talk to myself.

I’m bad at sports, I can run fast but that's basically about it.  I’m basically bad at everything. My biggest talents are guitar and golf but really I’m not that great at those either.

I have no ability to plan ahead or set realistic goals for myself for the future. I have no stable sense of identity and have constantly changed my behavior/music/clothes to get others to think I’m cool. I have no feasible idea what I would like to do for a career. Everything seems somewhat interesting yet I would quickly become bored of it.

I’m lowkey a huge pervert who thinks with his dick. I remember peeping up women’s skirts when I was 3 years old.

I hate being the center of attention but I want people to care and worry about me. It gives me a rush

I am jobless because I can’t move on from my sad pathetic past, and therefore I am doomed to a sad pathetic future. I’ve completely disassociated.  I just sit on the computer hoping I can go back and time and fix everything.

I envy so many people.  Because I'm so incompetent and I've done nothing but ruin myself, I just sit and envy all those who actually have plans and are making something out of themselves.

I am a spineless coward who hates confrontation and can’t stand up for himself, and can’t form an opinion for himself.

**I am literally so lucky too**, I was born into a big wonderful family that loves me so much, and also has a lot of money so I’ve never had to worry about anything. Which with my personality disorders explains why I have shit work ethic etc. The world could’ve been my oyster yet I was born with a defunct brain that would only lead me to ruining my own life.

It’s funny how I’m even blaming “the way I was born” for where I am in life. There’s no excuse for my behavior and actions. We all have free will, or so we like to think. I could try and say my mom drank/smoked while I was in the womb but what’s the point, I am how I am.

All I know is I’ve not been normal since I was born. I do remember they said I hit my head while I was being baptized. Maybe that was it.

I’m literally crazy, a huge moron with no common sense and likely pure evil at my core. How can someone be born like this? How?!? I want to care and give a shit about others, I always thought I did but I think it was for my own ego. I should probably kill myself so I can spare anyone else I may hurt, but the only thing stopping me is that I would ruin my family’s lives. I guess the best way to go would be to tell them who I really am, everything bad I’ve done so they can disown me and then I can die with no one missing me.

I’m sorry mom, dad, my twin sister, my grandparents, everyone who always saw potential in me because I was creative and good at math. I’m just a moron who doesn’t deserve to be here anymore.",t2_547kxp9h,5,0

Whether my hand is being forced by hormones, or by depression, I have decided years ago that I will end my life upon the end of high school. There is nothing for me left. I won’t be able to succeed, so why should I even try? There is no turn around. No help can fix my situation, because if there was, that would be cheating the system of society wouldn’t it be? The only thing I have to show for my existence is my game that I’ve programmed, but that means nothing in the long scheme of things.

My friend’s parents took his phone and basically are verbally abusing him for being trans and intentionally misgendering him.

I can’t come out to my parents or else I might be kicked out.

My friends are all leaving me at a disturbingly fast rate.

My ex broke up with me a few weeks ago and was really fucking bad about his word choice and ended up hurting me a lot

One of my friends found out about my self harm

I’m failing in two subjects and I don’t have any motivation to bring my grades up other than the fear that my parents will yell at me

There’s a lot more but those are the major stressors. I keep having recurrent thoughts of “what if I killed myself, would anyone miss me?” “How would “x” react if I was suddenly gone?” “What if I just stopped existing? Would my family be sad?” And other stuff like that. Suicidal ideation, I guess you could call it. I don’t really want to die. The thought of suicide scares me, and I know there’s a lot more to look forward to, but right now I just can’t handle the load of everything. I don’t trust my therapist a lot and I only see her once every two weeks, and I barely have anyone I can talk to anymore.

Interviews with a graduate researcher,"Hi, I'm a PhD student who's currently doing work on trauma and processes of mourning. I've had several people in my life take their own lives, and I have a history of ideation of my own. I'm looking for maybe four to five interviews with people who would be interested in discussing their feelings on suicide and thoughts about it. If Reddit especially is important in contextualizing or discussing your feelings, I'd be interested in hearing about that too. These would be STRICTLY anonymous and confidential, with no identification involved at any point in time. The interviews could also be conducted on whichever platform - Reddit, Skype, some anonymous platform, whatever works for you.

Is there a way to exist in a non-burdensome way?,"I feel offensive. All the time. 

When I talk about my feelings I feel attn seeky. 

When I hold in my emotions I feel in-genuine. 

When I get close to someone I feel anxious that I’m somehow subconsciously tricking them into liking me. 

When I isolate I feel like I’m worrying people or am being a freak.

When I joke around I worry I’m cringey or making people uncomfortable.

When I give my honest opinion I feel like a bitch.

When I go along with people despite opposing feelings I feel artificial and like a fraud.

I wish I could figure out a way to exist in a non offensive way. I just want to live alone in a cabin in complete isolation. I don’t want to have to interact with people in fear of causing negativity in anyone’s life. I’m so uncomfortable with myself.

This world wasn’t designed for someone like me,"I’ve decided I’m ready to go after two failed hanging attempts over the last decade. I’ll be purchasing a gun and blowing my brains out in the woods near the New River Gorge where nature can reclaim my remains.

I’m a pregnant trans male who is on the spectrum, chronically suicidal, C-PTSD, and going through a divorce from someone with antisocial personality disorder (he cheated and ran off with a real woman when I stopped being a trophy wife). I’ve been formally disowned by my narcissist mother and I’m considered a family secret by almost everyone else. There are few jobs in the state which I live and little hope of escaping the economic depression. 

To put it simply I’m exhausted and will set a date for my suicide once my child is born and safe. It will provide enough time to put affairs in order and make sure the funeral is planned out. Knowing my kid will never know me or know pain when I pass helps. I wish I could be there for them, but they deserve better.

I can’t continue fighting in a world that just doesn’t want people such as myself in it. Nor do I want my child to be exposed to suffering, my depression, or face intense prejudice by proxy and end up resenting me.

I have no cares about myself, I have no one who I can comfortably talk to anymore, I am starving myself so I feel physical pain outside of my own head. I get home and cry and imagine all the ways to kill myself and then wake up in the morning and that feeling is still as strong as it was when I fell asleep. And it’s hard, because as badly as I want to not be here, I can’t bring myself to do it because I’m scared it will fail again and I will have to continue living my life as even more of a failure. 

I just have no where to turn. 

I’m supposed to be going on holiday next week, and travelling later this year. But I really do not care. I’m not excited or looking forward to it. The only emotion I have about going away next week is anxiety about spending time with my family and them realising how fucking sad I really am.

I am too weak for this world.,"Yesterday the suicidal thoughts came back. The voices encouraging me came back. I wouldn't do it, because that would cause my mom's heart. Maybe she would kill herself too.

But I can't shake the thoughts out. I feel worthless, useless, just a dead weight, that does good to none. I want to think that it is not true, but I can't do it.

In this political climate (here in Mexico) people are dividing, and I'm in the middle, in the center. All of my friends will go to one side or the other. Everyone will abandon me. Will get away. 

I could just pick a side, but I would betray myself. I would abandon myself. I would be lying. I can't tolerate lies.

I will be alone. I can't stand being alone. But everybody tells me that is how it is supposed to be. That we are all alone. I can't live in such a world. But if it is line that, I must be too weak for this world. I can't live like this.

Feeling pathetic and pointless,"I read the ""No More Mr. Niceguy"" yesterday and installed Tinder in the morning. Bad idea! Feeling suicidal again. Whats the point of living when you are never good enough? Some women liked me but they were all settled with pets, hobbies, apartements and social life. I'm still at the phase that I try to figure out the apartement side.

The book made it clear for me that women have always loved me, but also found me to be pathetic and weak. I took their advice very litterally and closeted my sexuality (""dont objectify women"" == ""dont express sexuality to any woman at all""). Be nice and kind and dont be like the bad men. I became pathetic, and rubbed myself in the humiliation for so long. It was easy and like being a child.

I posted a picture on instagram where I was sad looking. Got a couple of likes and realized I have one friend.

I'm entering middle age and I think in a couple of years time I will be a suicide statistic. I'm one of these failed men that never lived up to anyones expectations, even less so my own. I have almost no sexual experience, no capital, no education. I have a job and a home, which I guess is more than some. However I come from a middle class socially where family life is central and the downfall to here has been a long and depressing journey with a lot of humiliation. I dont fit in there anymore. I dont have a family of my own. Every step I have taken in life I have messed up and taken one step closer to poverty and loneliness. Its like all the women around me are walking a upward staircase and I'm walking on a downward one. The system is simply built like this.

Why am I like this?,"  Hello everyone! This is my first time posting something on this site: I always imagined that my first question would be exciting or interesting, something worth reading. Instead, it's my last attempt to understand why I am the way I am, why is my whole existence so shallow. 

I'll turn eighteen in July, and by some unwritten rule I should be enjoying life, being free and careless, finding myself at the peak of the existential nirvana. Oh, those teenage years, they should be the best time of my life!
And yet,the fatigue is irremediable:it has sucked everything in me and it never gets satisfied of me, it will feel it's fullness only when the earth will swallow me in a silent vortex, in the tranquility that perhaps I deserve. I don't really have someone that cares for me nor that would be upset about me disappearing. There are many things that I'm bitter about, that leave me with that 'what if' possibilities open. Sadly, I'll never know. This is the path that led me to write this post, to decide whether I should keep going or not. 

Humans as a race crave interaction and were not made to be lonely. They're complex: emotions are necessary to build bonds and long-lasting relationships. According to Freud, however, the origin of social feelings is to be found in the feeling of jealousy that has as its object the mother and that opposes the brothers between them. When each one realizes that he cannot prevail over the others, he fights for at least equality of all and domination of one. Freud therefore believes that social justice means giving up a lot so that others too can give it up. This demand for equality,forms the root of social consciousness and a sense of duty. See? We all have different points of view when it comes to nearly anything. Now close your eyes. What do you see?
I see the mountains. Covered by a thick layer of snow. The snow shines in the sun. The frost pinches my cheeks, and I'm happy. Let's organize the snowball fight. Some create snowmen, others instead, sip hot chocolate and laugh when we are hit by a snowball. This is what I want. I think we all want it.
And what do you see?
In fact, give me a moment. Just enough time to finish, okay? Then I'll make you talk.

Take another breath. Take as much fresh air into your lungs as possible.
As if it was your last breath.

I am surrounded by a sense of peace and tranquility. Silence. And what do you feel? Silence, bliss, fear? It's difficult to tell, but I can perceive your confusion through the screen. Now restart the tape: the truth is that I don't feel anything. What I have described is just an idealized image that comes to mind in front of the word 'happiness', although I myself am not able to live it. 
I live a monotonous reality that flows before my eyes, without me being able to grasp it. Actually, I don't even live. I only exist. 
I imitate what I see to fit into what surrounds me because I do not have the strength or the ability to experience true feelings; I am not interested in creating solid relationships, healthy friendships and this throws me into a depressing spiral of loneliness. 
I don't particularly mind the latter, reading takes up most of my time, otherwise I sleep. It's as if I'm in a limbo, in the middle of nothing that stimulates me. I just simply don't care. This boring interlude of NOTHINGNESS is sometimes interrupted by my incredible narcissism and self-worship. Other times, however, this almost divine vision that I created of myself is non-existent. 
I try to be interested in something, to find myself a hobby, but every single thing occupies my concentration for a week at most. 
Why do others really live? Why can't I really live too? Why does my mind swing so much?


I have so little time available. I am not interested in living for other long years in this way. My psyche burns, my eyeballs are also burning: I would tear them away with my bare hands if I could.

Idk what to do anymore,"Well, this is kind of ironic... I made this account SelfGrowth some days ago and now here I am.. 
On a suicide watch sub. If you care to read this rant about why my life is a shit hole go ahead. If not, I’m unbothered... Here it goes.

So here’s some back story... My mom died when I was 4, I’m 20 now. my dad has had 2 girlfriends in the 16 years my mother has been gone. One of them was an argument every night and abusive type of situation and the current one is, well... she’s a bitch. A complete bitch.. Now, I’ve never really, “hated” someone but, I honestly really do hate her. She has ruined me and my dad’s life. First off, she has 4 of her grandkids living with us and her son.. YES, GRANDKIDS. It is complete bullshit. All I hear every fucking day is yelling and kids crying and then she just has the worst attitude. She’s not supportive AT ALL, she’s so negative and just loves to talk people down. She verbally and sometimes physically abuses the kids.. Now.. I know what you are probably thinking. Why the hell don’t I move out? Well, I’ll tell you why. I have shitty credit, I own a dog, and I’m unemployed at them moment because I quit my night job. Why did I quit my night job? because, I was depressed and just decided I can’t work nights because my mental health and wellbeing should come first. 
  So, back to the situation. My dad has tried to get rid of her and frankly. I don’t think he even wants her hut, she pays bills so I think thats the only reason she’s here... Well and he’s kind of being a pussy to kick her out because the whole kids situation and last time he was going to kick her out SHE COMPLETELY PLAYED VICTIM. Like sobbing and just being so selfish. Thats what she is after all. Selfish, this woman and at the time were just her son and only 2 grandkids came into my house with neither me or my sister knowing, just completely randomly came into my house and decided to move in. My dad didn’t even talk to us about any of it. He would go to her house and leave us here alone for days. My dad isn’t a very good parent honestly. Anyway, I just don’t know what to do. I’m tired of the kids, the yelling, the attitudes, the negativity, I don’t think there’s any kind of support except when her son does something good or anything.. That’s the only thing she cares about, her son. I’ve tried changing myself and being positive and all this. I quit smoking, stopped doing drugs, had a job, etc. I’m on a good path technically speaking but, I mean I don’t know what to do. Somehow I always get depressed again and I can’t escape this house or do anything.

First time poster on the other side of the problem,"I've tried to do my best to just not vocalize any of this because I don't like feeling like a weight other people have to worry or care about, but I seriously think I need to get this off my chest or I'm not going to be able to handle it.


I'm just kind of... generally a failure, I think. My dad's this fantastic software developer and my mom's a wonderfully supportive parent, my sister just managed to come out as trans and my younger two sisters are amazing artists for their ages and I can envision them doing great things, but I'm just some worthless sack of meat that does nothing but sit around, wasting time online.

I'm turning 20 this year, and I've never accomplished anything... worthwhile. I don't have the drive to do anything, I can't get a job, and to make things worse, because I'm diagnosed with T1D, I'm a massive drain on money for the rest of the family.
I honestly don't see any way to improve. I've tried, god knows I have, but the moment it seems like things are getting better, they don't, even if I try to push through it. 

And if this is all life is going to be, why bother going through the rest of it? The only reason I haven't done anything is I don't want my siblings to have to deal with seeing that, but I caught myself staring at the knife rack in the kitchen multiple times, just... imagining how much better off everyone would be.

More money for college and food and other nice things, no disappointment when I fail to do basic chores around the house, no more excuses for why I slept in until two in the afternoon /again/.

I hate being this kind of person. I don't want to, anymore, but the only way I legitimately see myself getting better is to just not /be/ anymore.

And the worst part is whenever I think these things, I feel like I'm trying to just excuse my laziness. Like if I died, I just wouldn't have to bother. Another excuse to go with the rest.",t2_7pmrf,2,0

I can’t handle being an adult.,"I was really responsible in high school. I got up at 5am every day to work out. I ate healthy. Did my homework. I worked and saved money, so I had over $3000 when I graduated. Bought myself a car and immediately got a full time job.

"Calling the police ""because they care""","A week and a day ago, a now ex-friend's parents called the local police for a wellness check on me, and proceeded to call my parents as well which sent them into a massive panic. It's still bothering and pissing me off to this day. I expected an apology for this, she responded by telling a mutual friend that she needed space. She thinks we're still friends and will be on the other side. We are not, and will not be. At a minimum, she has burned any opportunity to apologize and repair our friendship. Generally though I fully intend to be dead long before she comes around to deciding she wants to be friends again.

This has resulted in another friendship with someone I was incredibly close to pretty much ending because that friend went too far in defending her, and the net result is that I'm pissed at her and don't see her fixing that any time soon. 

I have had multiple people try to tell me this showed me that she cared. If she did, she had plenty of other routes to go that didn't involve panicking my parents or the police. It was the laziest route possible. I would honestly rather be dead than even threatened with involuntary commitment, and nothing anybody says will ever convince me otherwise.

should i kill my self? what other option do i have?,"the search for mental health care is doing nothing but driving me deeper into depression. i hate having to ask my mom for rides to therapy or asking her to call a new list of psychiatrists i found that take our insurance. the visits we’ve been doing are stressing her out. she tells me i should take matters into my own hands if i want to get better. i hate the “flip a switch and it’ll all get better” mentality but i’ve convinced myself that it’s true. 

even so, i failed her because i don’t succeed like other kids do. a mix of depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder is causing me to skip school and cry while doing homework. i torment myself by looking at things from her perspective. she works tirelessly to feed her kid. but what if that kid isn’t worth feeding? what if they have an equal amount of worth buried in the ground? 

the truth is, i want to be alive. i’ve went though every reason not to die, but none of them apply to me. i would be less of a burden, emotionally and financially, to mom if i were dead. i have no friends who will miss me. i have enough money in my bank account for a decent funeral. my method would be harmless to anyone else.

I think I'm ready (LONG),"I'm sorry this is long, I have nowhere else to turn at this point. You don't have to read it all. Basically I'm probably going to try to kill myself again this week.

It's currently almost 10am; I have a class in an hour and 80+ slides of notes to go through but all I can do is lie in bed wishing I were dead. I'm just so tired of feeling this way; everything hurts and my soul feels heavier and heavier every day. I feel like not even my therapist understands my unrelenting desire to die. I don't think it gets better for everyone, some people are meant to be sad forever and I think I'm one of those people. 

I've hesitated posting about this because I don't want reassurance or encouragement that ""it'll be okay."" It all feels like lies but it's all I ever hear. My life has gotten sort of better, I got a new job that actually pays well and is nice to me, and I have a really cool new roommate. But I still feel hollow and empty and way way too stressed. I have to write a paper every week for one of my classes, the 80+ slides per week is a low number compared to most weeks, and I work at my old job for another week. 

Maybe my outer problems don't seem that bad, they really aren't bad I guess, but the internal pain is what makes everything so much harder. I used to be able to shove it all down and grin and bear it when it came to the mundane shit in life but now I can barely get myself out of bed. It's worse than its ever been. I used to be able to get up and go to school/work the day after a failed suicide attempt and now I can't even get out of bed on a ""good"" day. Nothing feels worth it anymore. I'm just working and getting through bullshit until I die. 

I lost one of my pet rats on Friday. She was sick and I was too depressed and busy to take her to the vet when I should have. No matter what you say, I know it was my fault. I should've been there for her and I wasn't. I feel like I can't be there for anyone, and when I can be there for people they don't want me. There's a million other things going wrong but she's all I care about right now. I don't want anyone else in my life to die but I know they will, and I don't want to be alive to see them die. 

I have too much unresolved trauma, loose ends without closure, regret that's piling up, and self hatred that only grows with every day. I almost cry every morning when I realize I've woken up. Sometimes I'm happy, but those moments are fleeting and not nearly enough for me to ""hold on to when times get rough."" It's not worth it anymore. I have a boyfriend and I know this will hurt him, but the selfish thing is that I don't care. I don't care if I hurt people by dying anymore. I'm done. I'm already in so much pain just existing. I'm ready to do it. 

I think I'm going to try to hang myself. If that doesn't work, bleeding out with enough alcohol in my system so if the blood loss doesn't kill me the alcohol will. I know it sounds dumb I'm posting about this like i'm trying to get someone to stop me, but no one can. I just want it out there because it'll hold me accountable and I don't chicken out.

Fantasies about crashing my shitty car without a seatbelt but always worrying about the aftermath, my family, friends, girlfriend, pets, the traffic. It always seems so selfish but I want to be selfish sometimes. I don't want to be alive and sometimes think it's worth the shot to see what's beyond our current notion of life. The wonders, horrors and mysteries of whatever is beyond our comprehension of the world. All these thoughts since youth about the world (and possibly dimensions) that never escape my brain. Turning them off for a bit works but then i've found myself just trudging through life with no real drive despite ambition.

This feeling normally lasts for like a week then turns into depressive episodes of just not wanting to live anymore (currently what I’m stuck in, admittedly)

The thing is, I don’t even have a reason to feel like this. My life is what many people would call ideal. I don’t have an excuse to feel sad, I just am. I hate myself for this especially

At Least I Have Tomorrow,"Today hasn't been a good day. No jobs called back, I fell in mud and ruined the only pair of nice shoes I had, my right knee is messed up (dont have insurance), and my brain isn't exactly behaving how I want it to. The only redeeming part of today is that I said I wanted to die but another voice spoke louder and said you want to live. 

This is important because suicide used to be a comfort to me but for the first time in a long time I seemed to have shift in my mindset. I never thought this possible, even a few weeks ago (month). I feel anxious, sad, and a little hopeless but it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm learning to cope with my trauma and the learned habits I developed to protect myself from the ugliness of my environment. I'm not 100% better, I still have problems with my social anxiety, my self-worth, and night terrors but I'm actually starting to believe that I have a future. I stopped seeing one awhile ago, literally nothing came to mind, but hope regained its flutters and it's stirring something inside of me. 

I guess why I'm posting this is because I wanted to see success stories while I was hurting.Those stories where things aren't always okay but there was a sense of hope hidden between the tales.

The therapist asked me about suicide and I said I am thinking about it often.

She said, in her mind, suicide is a really reason to end your life and a shitty way to die. So I told her that nobody has ever given me a convincing answer as to why I should not kill myself when I hardly think about anything else. She dodged the question. Just as well.

But, I've come to the conclusion in recent years that I'm just not a happy person-I never will be. I can feel happiness, I can feel joy, love, lust, amusement. But I will never be, by default, a happy or satisfied person. It's just not who I am.

What is happiness?,"Is it a feeling? Is it a thought? What is happiness? What does it feel like to want to wake up in the morning and start your day? What does it feel like to smile involuntarily? What does it feel like to comfortable in your own skin? What is happiness? 

Is it making other people happy, because you don’t know how to be happy, yourself? Or is it those little daily bursts of dopamine that get you through your week? It’s hard lately, I know. It’s hard to eat, and it’s even more difficult to sleep. Your thoughts keep you up at night. Restless, always tired. You want to sleep in, it’s the weekend of course. But you can’t. Your mom won’t let you sleep in, or you have weekend shifts because you have to make ends meet and your rent is a bit overdue. 

So how can I be happy in the situation that I’m in? 

You like to be alone, but you don’t like being lonely. We’re human. We don’t like being lonely. Lonely means dangerous thoughts. Lonely means tears shed behind closed doors, and you’re tired tired tired. Lonely means you have no one but yourself. 

But it’s going to be okay, you know?

I know you don’t like hearing that. Hell, I hate hearing it. But you have to manifest it. 

Speak it into the universe. 

It’s going to be okay. You’re alone, but you aren’t lonely. I’m here, I’m listening. You are love and you are loved, love. 

It’s going to be okay. Life is fruitful. What would you be, without the things you have gone through? Happy? What would you be if you weren’t homeless that one time? Who would you be if you didn’t lose your brother or your sister or your mom or your dad? Who would you be if you didn’t graduate that school or pursued that love interest? Who would you be if you didn’t go through the hardships that shaped you today? You made it through today. You’ve had those bad thoughts, like usual. But you made it. And you can relax. Peace of mind is hard to attain, but let me give you a little piece of mind. You are as strong as you don’t thing you are, or as strong as you used to be. 

You have purpose. I have purpose too. I have to remind myself that although I’m sad now and forever, that it is possible to see the good in life, even if I’m just a shell of what I used to be. 

You will be okay. We will be okay, together. Happiness.",t2_5vlp05h6,23,0
If I thought there was anything after death I would feel so happy that I can finally kill myself without fear.,"Im a piece of shit that deserves to suffer and die a horrible death. But deep down I think I know better, but its easier for me to latch on to the anger of self hatred then to look at what really gets to me. Because when I do I start to feel the door opening inside me and when I peek through I feel the tiers start to come and that horrible clenching pain in my gut that makes me want to scream in agony, but before it can take me I slam the door shut and go back to my usual numb angry self. 

Sometimes when im alone though I will let it open and just accept that terrifying wave of pain, but no matter how long I stay curled up hugging my pillows waiting at the bottom of the ocean of misery, it never goes away fully. Eventually I just have to wipe my face clean and close the door again and go back to the hell that is living.",t2_5mct5l12,2,0

Depression and the people who treat it,"I’m posting this again here. As I tried to post three times previously with not one comment or vote in any other communities. 

I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You’ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",t2_rjgx7de,2,0

I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.,"I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

dOn'T wOrRy, I wont go through with this yet, I need some time to process this realisation.",anonymous,2,0
Suicide seems to be my only option. (TW: rape),"This will be long. I'm 22F. So to start from the beginning, my father was emotionally abusive as a kid (for example: he'd threaten to kill my mom and kidnap me and take me to Mexico, literally tried to hire a hit on my mom, threatened to sell me into sex slavery etc.). I also developed a phobia of dogs as a kid. My father used this against me by threatening to lock me outside with his two dogs (German Shepard and a large mutt) if I didn't do what he said. For example, he'd call my mother a bitch and if I tried to defend her he'd threaten to lock me outside with the dogs. So I did whatever I had to in order to appease him. 
Well, in third grade my mom moved us out of the state (away from all family unfortunately) and I've never seen him again. He got locked up when I was in middle school (unrelated charge) and has been in prison ever since. My phobia of dogs became way worse because of him so I was too scared to play outside or go to friends' houses as a kid. So I have always been a loaner. Eventually I became terrified of all insects too, which also made me despise leaving the house. 
Started developing severe OCD/depression/anxiety/suicidal ideation in middle school. Also became terrified of demons/evil spirits, convincing myself that there were demons in the house. I have at many times been convinced that I was possessed by a demon. For years I have even sometimes hallucinated shadow figures, spirits, and insects. I also have severe derealization and depersonalization. This causes my memory to be terrible. Sometimes I don't even recognize my own face in photos.
When I was 17, my dumb ass started selling weed (maybe as a way to make me feel less numb) so I started putting myself in bad situations because, again, I'm a fucking dumb ass. I spent the night at a 21 year old guy's house and I had sex with him once consentually. Then he raped me later that night. I was too scared to fight back cuz he had 2 big dogs in the other room, and he had them kind of as guard dogs so they were not friendly. Then I think he drugged me after that cuz things got hazy and I was really out of it. He left the room and told me to lay on my stomach then I heard his two roommates come in with him (but the room was pitch black so I couldn't see) and they all raped me (in all possible ways) and eventually I passed out but woke up in the morning and was bleeding; it hurt so fucking bad. He acted as though nothing happened. Again, I was too out-of-it and scared of their dogs to fight back. When I got home I noticed w*sps outside and became terrified, marking the beginning of my crippling phobia of w*sps. I can't say the word so don't comment that word without the asterisk please. I think of their $tingers as dicks so when I see one I kinda think they're trying to rape me. If that makes any sense. 
Then i started hooking up with a 34 year old and one time i went to his house and he had been drinking and i made it very clear that i didnt wanna have sex but he raped me anyways. Then one time i was selling someone an ounce of weed and he robbed me and raped me in the back seat of my car. All 3 rapes happened within a six month span. 
So the phobia of w*sps/dogs is so bad I literally only leave my house for work and even then im terrified. No one understands. They all just say to get over it. Therapists are all useless. 
So obviously I have no friends. I go to college online (I wanna be a teacher) but am so depressed I gave up a week ago, didn't do any of my midterms, so of course I'm failing all those classes. I have body dysmorphia and hate myself with a burning passion. I'm 5 foot 6, 103 pounds but still think I'm fat as fuck. I can see my ribs and hip bones, but I have a large bone structure so I'm still fat. I starve myself to lose weight (I wanna lose 15 more pounds) and mainly only consume calories in alcohol. It helps to numb my emotions. I may lose my job cuz I'm too scared to leave the house. Men always leave me cuz im fucking batshit and am often too scared to leave my house. I cant blame them. I am utterly unlovable and pathetic. I wanna die.",t2_5vwls9ol,7,0

A friend of mine really needs help and I'm out of ideas.,"TLDR: A friend of mine is going through some real hard times, lots of trouble with her parents and with recent horrible things that happened to her.

I've been close to her for about one year, and we've rarely seen each other, but she trusts me and I'm trying my best to help her.

She already attempted to commit suicide, but it didn't work, and since then she's been a little better.

But today she texted me saying that after what happened last weekend ruined her (this guy that she thought was her friend only wanted sex and now she's blocked), plus she honestly thinks her mother hates her. In her words, it has come to a point where she has no reason to live anymore.

I've tried and tried but she does not listen to me and keeps saying that she'll do it.

Any ideas on how to convice her otherwise?",t2_zvgva,3,0

I'm not enjoying anything that I normally enjoy, it's even ruining my job. I'm back home visiting family and still do not feel any joy what-so-ever.

i think im going to hang myself tonight,"ive been suicidal since before I was 13. I’ve never been able to have a real group of friends who truly care about me and I really, genuinely think that I never will no matter how hard i try. Im last year I felt completely alone and worthless. I only had my direct family to talk to bcs I just isolated myself in my room. at a point my family didn’t even want anything to do with me because my therapist was gonna call cps on my parents, even though I tried to defend them as much as I could. I truly just wanted to make my parents’ pain end and not be such a nuisance and burden on everyone around me. I started just,,hacking at my wrists every day with chisels and tools in my room, and at one point my dad even came into my room and caught me doing it and didn’t stop me, so that felt like encouragement to just end it. I was so close but i got a message from my now-ex boyfriend that day asking if I wanted to hang out. We already knew eachother but when we started hanging out we were instantly so close, and he made me feel so appreciated and not worthless. Plus I spent all of my time at his house so I didn’t have to deal with problems at home anymore. It felt like i was worth something to someone for once. I really thought he was saving me , like it was a divine intervention. 

For the past week or so my boyfriend had been telling me that me and my whole family is going to burn in hell. It came out of nowhere he was just suddenly constantly aggressive, insulting to me, and purposely disruptive in my house. He has bipolar disorder so i was just trying to help him get through the manic episode he was clearly going through. he has told me that I’m not a good enough Christian girl for him, and that my prayers sound like bullshit apparently, which has completely got my confidence down as I found God on my own, and he had been raised Christian, so it feels like someone who has way more knowledge than me on the subject is just telling me to give up my faith. 

It’s about a year after my last suicide attempt and my healed arms are covered in slashes again, a noose made from my xbox cord is hanging in my closet, my family just sees me as a burden more than before because I’m 18 now, and my ex boyfriend has made it clear to me that im worthless. 

He left my house a couple nights ago and he has continued to tell me things like “I hate you” and “i hope you enjoyed that mediocre dick you STUPID BITCH” even though he was the one I lost my virginity to, and ive never had sex with anyone else. He also keeps saying that my family is going to suffer and burn. And i know he’s been acting crazy, but since he started saying those things, my family has been going through so much shit. My dad walked out on us the other night and hasn’t come back at all, we had to call an ambulance and take my sister to the emergency room, my other sister keeps fighting with my mom, one of my dogs got injured and my dad has refused to bring her to the vet. i dont even wknow what to do because  i know hes crazy and i know my family isn’t going to hell, but things just keep happening and i feel like my whole life is falling apart. i reslly want to kill myself but I’m also afraid of going to hell , especially after everything

i have stood in my closet with the noose around my neck multiple times in the past few nights. I’m short enough that if I get off of my tip-toes and stand flat, I will die. it would be so easy

i feel like somehow i can make everything better if i just take myself out of the situation. it may hurt people at first but i ultimately feel like it would do more good for everyone i love than bad. I feel so worthless. I still love my ex. i cant stop feeling broken and alone right now. i can kill myself Right now. My family isn’t home and I can literally just walk into my closet and die right now. i almost wish my ex would just tell me to kill myself becsuse i wouldnt feel so bad doing it, or at least it would give me enough momentary courage to do it quickly .

i feel so stupid and worrhless even typing any of this im sorry if it’s incoherent or hard to read im jst kind of pouring everything out rn. ljust keep looking up things that might encourage me to end it and i figured i would make an attempt to ask for advice becsuse i dont feel like i can tell anyone that i care about how close i am to doing it",t2_5c89mzg2,17,0

I'm going to run away,"I've constantly had these feelings of running away from the life I've always known. Currently, I'm planning on becoming missing and commit suicide in an undisclosed location. Life has been a cruel joke at this point. I've suffered long enough. I'm tired of feeling like a foreigner. No matter where I go, I never belong. High school has been the worst four years of my life. I've been ostracized for the smallest things. I hate being considered the 'smart' kids. That label has been more of a curse than a blessing. I'm not seen as a person. Instead, I'm more like a score on a leaderboard that has to be overwritten. Whenever I make a mistake, I get put down and insulted often. In addition, I get slut-shamed for being sexually assaulted and berated with slurs. I constantly feel like a burden because people are annoyed by me and don't give a shit about how I feel. Life has always been fucking me over ever since I was born. My family would care less about me. The people who claim to 'care' about me are fake and shallow as hell. They say they want me to succeed, yet they expect me to fail. I hate my life and the shitty people in it. As a result, I'm constantly being exposed to a toxic environment at home and school.

I'm done trying to get better. There is no better for me.,"I'm 29.        

My whole life has been a struggle against myself and the things that have happened to me.         

I've been trying to get better. I've been trying. I really have. I've been in therapy for 6 years. Trying to fix myself. Trying to get better.         
 
And in some ways, I have. I'm less emotionally volatile now. Have a better grasp on my emotions, so they dont get out of hand.     
 
But underneath that? Underneath my breakdowns and explosions and meltdowns? What do I have?         

Emptiness. Self-hatred. Such strong, overwhelming, inescapable self-hatred. I **hate** myself. More than words could ever express. I feel so worthless, and hopeless, and tired, and I genuinely don't think it's ever going to get better. I dont think I will ever be able to live a meaningful life.         


I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years. I am a leech, stealing love from him because I have none to give myself. I am incapable of being okay with myself, so I seek love and validation from everyone else. And it is never enough. I need constant reassurance. I know it makes him tired. I know he is tired. I'm so sorry.                 


I have no job. I have no source of income. I'm turning 30 this year and I have done absolutely *nothing* to plan for myself or my future, because I have always lived under the assumption that there wouldn't be a future for me. I'm living off an inheritance, and I've got ~$2k left. I was on disability benefits before, because of my mental illness, and I'll have to reapply for it now. But it all seems so pointless.         


Why am I still here? Why do I keep going? Every single day, I wake up and feel overwhelmed by how much I hate myself. I feel hollow, and empty, and broken. I don't want to try to get better anymore. I don't want to try and be okay anymore. I just want to slip under the water and disappear.      


I don't feel like it's worth it anymore. I dont feel like *I'm* worth it anymore. I hate myself so much. I don't even want to try anymore. I don't want to go to therapy anymore. I don't want to try to get better anymore. There is no better. This is it. There's no escape from my self-hatred. It's consuming me. And I'm going to let it. I give up.

I don’t know what to do,"I dated a girl I was very much in love with, and after three months she was pregnant, the. For nine months we were so happy, then when our daughter was born she stopped being kind to me. Then her family started doing small things to bother me and make me want to go; then they did big things, like wake our daughter up 4 hours earlier than she liked to: just because I worked until midnight and was the only one who could watch her in the mornings.
Then I started hearing her family say made up stories about me from my girlfriend. I decided I couldn’t deal with them so I asked my girlfriend if we could look for apartment and move out. We did that and when we finished she said she wasn’t ready. Then she started treating me like shit and saying I was a bad parent no matter how good I did. Everyone I know was telling me I’m good and doing a good job; but the first person I loved was making me feel bad about myself. This went on for months, so then I started staying with my parents.
She drew me back in; saying she’d change, but it just stayed the same. We fully broke up the next time I tried living with my dad and driving over in the morning to pick up my daughter. This time she tried even harder to pull me in: and I gave in and when I did; she started acting like I didn’t exist. My texts would go unanswered for days, whenever I spent time with her and the baby, at most two times a week with our work schedule, she started the day mad, and would always do something super rude. I loved away a last time and we broke things off pretty amicably this time. But she still does things to make me feel bad: I tried talking to her and she said I’m making everything up about what her family did; and that I act like everything is someone else’s fault.
I know I’m not perfect, I admitted my mistakes and worked on them; but she was never willing to do the same: and her and her parents are a part of my life forever.
Today is the last morning I get to spend with my daughter: she’s too mature and Independent, spending time with her just makes me sad. She’s going to start attending full day daycare, and being picked up by her mom like she has been before. I called out sick for my last two days of work, I just called out the rest of the week. My bank accounts at zero because of stress eating and my ex being an expensive person to be with. I feel like my life was over. If we never had a baby I could move on and hope my next relationship is better; but nobody wants to date a 20 year old with a baby: a medium paying job with horrible hours, who’s last relationship ended like this. 
I just want to die and I know I have the confidence to do it which is what scares me. I just think my life is over. I still have so many people that love me, but my daughter I never see won’t be one and my first ever girlfriend who I loved and tried for more than anything and I never got anything back from won’t be one. And to make things worse before we dated she was a huge whore, and she’s going back out partying when she should be with our daughter, and I can’t stop myself from going online and seeing it everywhere. I just don’t want to be alive.",t2_3sp6eiqx,1,0
A reprieve from life,"Y’all ever just stop trying to fake it? Maybe I should call it fake it, cuz I mean it most of the time. I really do try to be happy and spread as much joy as I can, but it always ends up running me ragged. To a point where nothing helps, where I turn to drugs and harm. The amount of times that I’ve stared at the wall of my room completely void of all emotion, not just void of happiness but sadness too, Is ridiculous. I don’t think I’m depressed, I’ve seen depression and it’s horrible but I still function, and I still get through my day. I just feel like not me. I don’t feel anymore. So everynoe and then I’ll wrap an old belt without the buckle lock thing around my throat and just knock myself out. Those few moments of euphoria make the world a better place for me. And then I cry. I cry so fucking much when I wake up, and it feels good. I like it when I’m sad. I fucking love it. I revel in it cuz I’m finally feeling and I can do something. Sometimes I push myself till I’m dead on my feet, and then I just break. And I love it. I live for the moment when I can’t take it anymore and I just snap or break or cry.

I've been contemplating it for several years. I think today might be the last straw.,"I'm sorry to bore you all with my problems, but I guess I just need to vent and write this down somehow. The more I write the more pretentious and foolish I feel, cause I guess I still have enough self awareness to know that many, many others have had it worse. But I guess if I actually choose to do it, I'd love for someone to understand my situation at the end.

7 years ago, I went to Japan from Vietnam at the age of 18, carrying on my shoulder the hope and dreams of my family, especially my mother, who wants nothing more in her life than to see me succeed. I didn't have any dream then but I had hope, along with the curiosity and belief of a young mind that I can take on anything in this modern world. At first, it was fine, I was among my peers, my fellow foreign students who are all as naive and oblivious as the one next to them. That was, until 6 years ago when I left my friends in Tokyo and enrolled in a prestigious college in Osaka.

And now, here I am, 2 years over without being able to graduate, about to go on to 3. I faced all kinds of problems I never knew I would have trouble with. From a popular kid to a weird, unarticulated foreigners, I failed constantly to form a decent social relationship, I struggled and pretend to fit in but that also failed. I remembered I was so ashamed of my daily failures that I stopped talking to my family and friends, and ultimately shut myself in.

Two years ago, things started to turn around. My dear mother, despite me being the absolute failure of a son, found out about my address in Japan and she came right up to my doorstep herself, without being able to speak any Japanese or English. Then I met my Japanese girlfriend, who made me feel so good about myself, and it's all because of her that I got accepted to one of the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan. I thought nothing could go wrong from here...

But today, it did. I didn't have enough credit to graduate. 2, to be exact, or one single Math class. I don't even know what to say. Inside me there's just a black hole made out of shame and disappointment that seems to just be swelling up and consumes my everything until my total being is defined by it. Nothing but a pathetic, worthless losers. It's actually laughable, the whole thing, and that makes me want to end it even more. I now love my family and my girlfriend more than anything, myself included. I know me ending my life will destroy them, but oh man how it's tempting. I don't know if it's my inner selfish demon that's rationalizing, or even glorifying the act of suicide, but I just can't fathom anyone who would love a piece of shit like me again. I don't even like myself. I used to, which is the tragic part. But now it just seems like it was just a fool's gold, like the way that elephant looked to the blind man in the story.

Laugh at me, sympathize with me, pursuade me all you want. I can't stand the fact that if the school choose to put me through another whole year of tuition for me to relearn some equations that I'd never use again in my life, I'll choose a high building and jump off of it. Preferably at night so it won't cause a scene. Not much at least. I can't even imagine how I'd have the audacity to let my parents handle one more year of my tuition, let my girlfriend buy me stuff in our anniversary because I'm broke, or suffer on more sleepless night drowning in fear, anxiety and sorrow. 

Oh man, I'd do it in a heartbeat if I have no one who cares about me. I guess I'll wait until the 19th, it's the day the school will let me know if my score will be reevaluated or not. I don't even feel scared. This feeling like being stepped on 24/7, it will finally be relieved. If it comes to that, then I love you, mom and dad and my family. And you too, Risako.

An honest request for support,"I have reoccurring memories of being gang raped in a black Methodist church, after being sold to the church by my father. A heroin dealer in jail for killing someone . I’m a social worker and have helped abused kids now, which has been enough for years. It’s not enough anymore and never will be, but I’m glad for that purpose in my life. I worked for many years at a hospital helping suicidal children at a masters level. I was effective based on my background. I have never seen help that exists to help someone like me.

I can’t ever let myself sleep or I have to re-live being stored in a “coal/canning room” until some disgusting adult wanted to fuck me. I was 8 by the way. I have built a semi-normal life, but now my substance abuse is ruining that too. I’ve tried every type of therapy and am at the point that my life is now harming those I love the most. 

My husband is not interested in constantly putting his life on hold to help me. He’s in medical school, and at some point can’t keep hurting his life to help me. My existence solely causes me and those I love pain. He’s going to leave me, but I would rather do this independent of that decision, before I become his trauma. This cycle has to stop with me.

I'm just tired.. Of All Of It,"I don't know what to do or say anymore... Nobody does. My life is going nowhere and it's never going to go anywhere.

My fiancé makes it better sometimes, but then we fight and I just realize how much of a burden I am. If he ever gets tired of me I'll be homeless, I have nowhere else to go. I only have my fiancé and my dog..

I lost my glasses while surfing 🏄‍♀️ how do I tell about it to my parents?,"ok well first my mom had always told me to remove my glasses whenever I go to swimming or to the beach and I never listened to that. I always wear it even when I take a shower cuz if I remove it, I see everything blurry.

so today we (me, my family &amp; our family friends) all went to a beach. we weren't expecting anything like surfing. in fact, it was my first time trying to surf.

after I got a surfing board, I went to the water with my glasses, even when my mom told me to remove it in case I lose it. I was like okay even though I did not care.

after I went a bit far with my surfing board, I got back to the board and was wiping the water off my glasses. while wiping, a wave came unexpectedly. 

after the wave, I started seeing everything blurry and noticed my glasses weren't there. I knew i can't find it now cuz it's the beach like if you lose a hair band, you can't find it. I was in the deep area too.

I got my glasses on November 2019 and I don't even know how to tell my parents about it. they are very strict and they will obviously scold me for losing my glasses.

this happened around 3-4 hours ago and I'm still thinking about this. I keep on thinking about this. what should I tell my parents?

few minutes ago, my mom asked me where my glasses are, and I said it's in my cosmetic box. she was like 🤨 cuz she knows I would never remove it. I see everything blurry right now. I can't see long distance and short distance both.

i have been thinking about this a lot. it makes me very sad. when I lose something, it makes me extremely sad 💔

i hate myself and i should have never existed,"this is my first actual post ever but whatever
ive honestly been sad ever since secondary school started. ive had adhd since i was 7? and for the duration of primary school i always thought that was an advantage, getting extra time during exams and whatnot. i was so wrong. secondary school struck, and suddenly it hit me. adhd dragged me down. i got good grades in the final exam in primary school and that got me into one of the top schools in my country. but bcos of the expectations of top schools for the students and me with adhd it dragged me down so much. even with my extra time i can barely finish my exams anymore (im 3 years into secondary school on my 4th and last year now) and bcos of this i frequently breakdown and i have depression (diagnosed a year ago) mostly bcos of my adhd and i have so much backlog from homework that i promise my teachers i would do but in reality its just empty promises bcos as much as i try i physically and mentally cant finish my work anymore even with my meds and im just so fucking useless whats my point on being on this earth if my life is so shit. im trying to get better and i thought i was getting better but im just getting worse and worse and im resorting to cutting myself again when the pain gets too much. i want the sweet release of death but ironicaly i fear death bcos im afraid of what comes after (meaning where our souls go after death, do we just poof, and i dont want to poof) like why even be on this earth when you cant even pull yourself away from your phone to do your homework i know it may sound simple but it really isnt, not for me at least. i hate myself so much man i feel so useless. id rather not have existed at all than to live and experience this. i’ll still be around (i fear death) but ive been in a really dark place recently and im having depressive episodes even more than i used to and its not helping me in the slightest other than making me a big mess and not want to go to school. i just- i dont care if anyone sees this or comments bcos no one should give a fuck about how i feel but i just wanted to get it out.",t2_1zn6412x,1,0
I feel so hopeless. I feel like killing myself is the only way out.,"My family has abused me for years, and I am sick of it. I graduated recently, and my mother posted it in the family group chat, knowing that my siblings are jealous of my achievements despite being much older than me; true enough, my brother sent a condescending message and told me to ""Let past be past. Welcome to life past school."" I don't want to be gaslit here. It's difficult to understand the nuances of relationships, but it's just such an off message. And I thought - if I ever want to achieve my dreams and get ahead in life, I can never let my family know.

I want to run away. Even though I'm 23 and I should be able to go off on my own I *can't*. I don't have a bank account to my name because I keep getting rejected because my father is considered a politically exposed person internationally and by affiliation so am I. How am I supposed to get a visa if I can't prove my financial standing when I don't have a bank account? I just want a bank account where I can hide my savings from my parents because I don't know what they'd do. I need a visa because I just got accepted into grad school. I can't................... I'm tired. I'm so tired. It's not fair. I never chose to be born into that family. It's like nobody protects people like me.

When I told my parents about grad school, they were very hesitant. My mother kept making excuses like there's coronavirus in the state that I plan to study in despite there being more in my home country, that my parents want me to return to - despite the poor healthcare over there, and tries to steer the conversation about her illness. I know she's healthy and wants attention. Please believe me. I'm not crazy. My family is full of narcissists and I just want to get away. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm glad that I didn't tell my parents about my grad school acceptances (with funding, thankfully) because just like what happened about my graduation, which was supposed to be a happy memory, they wanted to undermine it. I'm so sad that I was born into their family. I hate that growing up I was my mother's ""favorite,"" which turned my siblings, all of which are older than me by at least six years, against me. I hate my siblings for not being mature. I hate my family for not treating me with love. I hate my mother for wanting to sabotage my happiness and success. I hate my father for valuing his ego more than my wellbeing.

I want life to get better but I don't think that's possible for people like me with actual tangible barriers. I'm from a third world country where I'm so sheltered to the point that I'm too scared to leave my house and ride public transportation. I've gotten more used to living overseas than living in my country, but I can't go anywhere without a visa, and I need to prove my intent to leave the US once my master's has finished (I'm YET to go) but I don't have anything to use as proof. I can't even open a bank account because of my father's political background. Is there really nothing for me? I think if I try to play along with what my parents want, become the scapegoat of abuse and all the problems my dysfunctional family has for the next three years, I think I just might die.

I've got pills in one hand and my suicide letter in another.,"For reference, I'm 14. This isn't something with my hormones like everyone I've tried to go to had said, I've struggled for years and now that I tried to get help I realised there's nothing to look forward to. 

When my dad abandoned me and my mom, I first learnt to never lean on anyone. He left is with no money, support, nothing. My mom raised me for two years as a toddler on hey own, even hey parents didn't help us. I would always hear of a mother and father, but when I would always my mom where dad is, when he's coming home where would just drink more. It's currently gotten to the point where she's so drink I have to open her bottles and if I don't, I get punished. So, I've never had a stable adult figure. But back when I was five, she met by half brother's father, whose worse then my own. He would hard me for the color of my son as I'm mixed and they're both white. I would be yelled at, and hit at age 5 for something it off my own control. 

So, my mom tried clearing my skin. I still remember the singing pain almost ten years later and have scars all over my body. Then, my mom had my brother. He was their perfect child. Blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin, there was nothing he could do wrong. But I couldn't go near him, his father threatened to throw me against the wall of the apartment if I did, so almost everyday after kindergarten I would just sit in the corner of the living room and cry. Even he couldn't stay long though, when my brother was three months old about, he left is alone like my father did. So the three of us had to move into her mom's house, because she couldn't keep a job long with her addictions. 

You'd think it couldn't get worse, right? But no, the new living space caused me to move schools, where from grades 1-5 they would physically push me to the ground and make fun of me for my lost father and my brown skin. The same five girls. I couldn't escape my torture anywhere. They would make me five them the answers to a test, would or their hot food on me, and make fun of me for having to go in the free food line. 

Around two years ago, grade 6, my father finally reached out to me. I had no idea what he looked like even, the last time I'd ""seen"" him was when I was two. He fought for custody and got every other weekend. When I have to go over there, I see how he completely replaced what he had with my mom. He married a woman just I've year younger than my mom, with a child only did months younger. Since then they've been a constant reminder that I want enough for him. Like I'm not worth anything. It's been the biggest jab in my heart, more then him leaving in the first place. The woman makes snarky comments shit my hair, the way I dress, how I have ""no style"", no curves, I'm too tall, anything that she can think of to crush my soul when I'm there.

Now, I've lived in this cycle of harassment from my brother (he gets it from his dad that he sees every other week), kids at school, my dad's wife. But I found a guy my age last year that my neighbor. He wanted to date me, and even though I though we were to young the though of someone caring about me made me his ""girlfriend"". That was year 7. Since then, he's done things like touch me in my personal areas, and tried going all the way. He scares me, but I'm afraid of him, but afraid to leave one of the only people that ""cares"" about me, even if it's fake. 

I just can't anymore. Goodbye. 👋",t2_5vvr0cbo,4,0

Im constantly thinking about death. How it would be better to me, because i cant get a job, because of the ways i struggle in life, because im a failure in this society. I hate the world for how it is, because i cant work with it - i cant function in it. Its not made for weak people like me. 

I honestly just want to dissapear, i probably would be happy if i lived alone on an island - but i cant do that now can i. Nothing is gonna make me happy, and they say these are the happiesrt years of our lives, anf i just read an article saying it doesnt really get better, it gets worse. And im cring right now. I cant do that, i cant get a will to live knowing it gets worse, it gets harder. I cry every fucking day, my heart tears everyday. And then it tears some more because i think of how hard its gonne be to die, because honestly i dont want to kill myself. Its torture, i dont want it. But im gonna have to, because i do not want to live. Im such a burden in this world and honestly who wants to be that? 
No one, thats who.

Im sick of everyone telling me to get a therapist, im sick of everything. I have no fucking joy. I spend my days waiting for my fucking ex of several months to text me cause thats is the only friend i have. And everything in me know i dont want to be his friend and we shouldnt even be talking or seeing each other, but i know how destoryed i would be if i put a stop to it.

No one tells me they love me, or that they care about me, and no one shows it other than my ex sometimes.

Suicide Cycle?,"This is my first time posting in a forum and it's weird, but I guess I just want to vent a little...
I just feel empty...
My brother killed himself 2/5 years ago, he was 30. I realistically know it's not my fault, but I feel kind of guilty for not being able to find him in time. I've been to therapy, but I still feel guilty. There was so much I could have done. For the past two years I've been quite ok with this, his death I mean. I thought I could just power through, I kept busy with work and other things and I kept a very strict routine, so I wouldn't fall into a rabbit hole. But since the beginning of this year I feel like I'm letting everything fall apart. The other day I just realized how empty and lonely I feel. I'm not technically lonely, I have my husband, my parents and my older brother, but still. I feel like something else is missing. I've also realized that since he died I haven't been able to create any bonds with other people. I feel like I'm an alien, so disconnected from everyone else, does anyone else feel like this?  
I feel like I've already lived the best part of my life, soon my parents will die too and I don't feel like going through more deaths, to be honest. I had a pretty good life, but I'm starting to think that it is enough. But then I start to think about my family and I don't want them to go through this again.

I feel so lonely all the time and its gotten to the point where the sympathy that i get from others is not helping me at all and i often fantasize about me failing my attempt at suicide and then receiving love from my friends and family

Im so fucked in the head i know, idk why i am so desperate for attention and the guilt is killing me and deiving me insane to the point where i don’t sleep until 6 or 7 am just thinking and cutting and listening to music but i just can’t stop and i feel like if i do what i was talking about eventually that won’t even satisfy my needs and i’ll just end up actually killing myself, honestly the fact that im on this app now basically asking for attention once again just shows how much of a bad person i am, i am at the position where i feel too bad to tell my friends or my brother that i am in a very bad place right now so i end up having to resort to here because it makes me feel less guilty i dont even know if im making sense right now but i hope you guys can understand what i am saying",t2_4gabw8tl,2,0

"I thought that after your first suicide attempt, you'd realize suicide want the answer? 20y/o Female","In 2016 I attempted suicide. I went to school and took some old Tylenol pills i had in my backpack. The only close friend I had at the time was the only person I told what I would be doing. It was such a surreal feeling taking pills in the hall right beside my classroom, taking a sip of water by the water fountain with every pill I took. Because I was scared, i went slow at first. I took two pills and greeted a friend who walked passed me on their way to our first class. I took two more and paused to think about what I was doing. I decided that I already committed and wanted to do it. I took 4 more. Soon after, the bell rang and it was time for my 9AM class. That day in class (it was my Jazz Performance class), we had a practice day so everyone broke off into groups and went to practice rooms to work on some pieces we would be playing for our upcoming concert. I waited and nothing happened in the first 20 minutes. I had not researched what would happened if I overdosed on pills- I preferred not to know. While waiting for the worst to happen, I clutched my violin and walked into the room where my current crush and moral/religious inspiration was, practicing piano. I didn't say much and I cant remember everything i said, but I had asked him if God forgave people after they committed a sin. He told me thats not how it works. To wrap up, my friend told the school consular and I was taken out of class and taken to the hospital to treat me for the pills I took.

When all this happened, eventually I regretted it and i ended up meaning my current fiance. But, lately life has been so pointless and meaningless. I dont know what I am doing wrong.

\-If i ask my parents for therapy, they always reply with ""You need God."" or tell me to go to church. (still live with parents)

\-I have become so unmotivated that I cant stream (im a streamer on twitch), I can barely get the motivation to go to school, do any homework, study, take care of myself, practice good hygiene, doll myself up etc

\-Im failing all of my college classes and If i withdraw, I will have another 3k to pay for the classes I drop which I cant pay

\-I am still paying off my last suicide attempt for my medical bills on top of 2 other medical bills (totaling about 3k), but I can barely pay it off because I am a full time student and a part time employee at a non-profit organization meaning that my pay is really low.

\-I do bad socially so I do not have any friends as all except my fiance

\-my fiance leaves to go to the airforce soon, leaving em with no one left to interact with or to feel emotional relief

Currently, the only thing keeping me from killing myself and attempting once again is the fact that I love my fiance and he loves me too. But sometimes, You cant be fixed with just love. Im not sure what to do. Once he leaves, I will be all alone. He is going so we can move out and so that we can finally make ourselves independent, but im scared. Im scared that once he leaves that I will be alone with my thoughts. I fear that I will relapse into my eating disorder, or worse, that I will make another suicide attempt.

EDIT: I guess its important to note that I am no longer religious. After the attempt, my religion, and personal importance for it, pretty much dropped completely.",t2_5vygdh9x,1,0
What should I do?,"Hi! Well I'm writing this here because one of my best friends is feeling a down a lot lately. Years before, she told she's depressed and after she told me that I just treated her the same way I treated her before. I laughed a lot with her, listened to her concerns and what bothering her. But now I'm really worried... A few months earlier she told me she can't take it anymore... that she wants to die... she has already attempted killing herself... She already set a date wherein she's gonna kill herself. I'm really alarmed and worried about this... It's obvious I don't want her to die! I want her to live her life! See everything good in this world! But she doesn't want it... She doesn't want any help... Sometimes my mind just tells me to let her go... but i love her so much that I just can't leave her alone hurting like that... She's my friend, she's already my sibling! If ever she reads this, she might identify that its me, or maybe think that this is just a mere coincidence.

Please give me some advice... Thank you",t2_5o0j48ek,2,0

Feeling awful since 2016," 

I just feel awful all the time, I don't even hang out with anyone at this point.

I always self doubt my anxiety, depression and self concious issues but I know they're a constant. to me every day since I remember. I don't know if it was one thing that caused it or what, but I know something is deeply, deeply wrong with me.

I think it might have started to get really bad around 4 years ago. The place I was in caused me to have mental breakdowns and cry myself to sleep, but i'd doubt the situation I was in. I think this is why I cannot cry anymore, unless i'm yelling at people. The only time I can cry is when I yell at people, for some reason. I think its because my parents used to fight a lot, and still do, or something.

I really, really badly want to kill myself. I don't even bother talking to the one person who probably cares, cause they're dealing with stuff right now, and its awkward. It wouldn't help in the first place. I want desperately to go do stuff with friends in real life but I don't hang out with any of my ""friends"" outside of school.

People were talking about each other nicely on social media, and when the people who are my ""friends"" didn't mention me. They all mentioned each other saying nice stuff, but not me, so i'm pretty sure i'm not really their friends. If that's the case I only literally have one online friend.

My Mom Superstitions,"Since I was little my mother has told me of her superstition of seeing a black crow and having it look at her when someone she loves is going to die.

It’s early this morning and I’m in the parking lot of a store stocked up on my favorite drugs hoping to overdose. A few seconds before I’m ready to back out of the parking spot I see a crow. It sits on top of the shopping cart return section in the parking lot and it just sits. Strange to me but I don’t think anything of it. I get back to my house with the feeling of ultimate nothingness. When my phone rings. My mother. I haven’t spoke to her in a time because I recently wrecked my car. Not as a suicide attempt it was truly an accident one where I wasn’t injured but totaled my car. Her as well as my dad weren’t concerned with me at all. Just the car so I just wasn’t really speaking to them. I’m 19 and moved out about a month ago. Anyway I get a call at about 8am. She tells me she’s sitting on the couch (this is strange in itself for she doesn’t usually wake until about 11 or later) she said she was having bad dreams that I had hurt myself. She didn’t specifically say of a suicide just that I took my life. She called and apologized for her behavior. My heart is having stabbing pains. I haven’t taken these drugs. Still want to.

I’m gonna kill myself tomorrow night,"i only have two friends in college. I’m slowly growing apart from them because I can’t go to parties or hang out with them when their other friends are around (I have social anxiety disorder). So I’m by myself literally all the time. And when I am with my friends they often talk about things that happened at parties or while they were hanging out without me, which isn’t bad, but it really makes me feel like complete shit.i don’t have anything to offer in my friendships. All I bring is negativity and bad energy and constant problems and whining. Nobody wants a friend like that. Nobody wants a friend who can’t go out with them and can’t even be around other people.

There’s no one I can just relax with and feel comfortable being myself (and that’s a while different problem because I’ve been mentally ill so long that I don’t know who I am, which brings me to my next point)

I don’t have anything I enjoy and I never really have. Every once in a while I’ll find something that I like doing, but it fades really quickly. It’s probably because I have dysthymia.

GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS BODY

I won't kid myself, I guess I'm just not trying hard enough, it's probably a combination of that plus me not being important enough to anyone to merit assistance in getting the help I really need. Some days suicide does seem like the only viable option. 

Do you know what it's like to not be able to use public bathroom stalls? To not fit in the driver's seat of your own car? To not be able to physically go anywhere and find clothes that fit you? To be devalued and marginalized for the way you look at EVERY TURN since childhood? Do you know what it's like to always be looked at by strangers and loved ones alike with combined pity and disgust? Do you know what it's like to want to get better so much, but to do it you'll have to fight against the most effective INSTINCTIVE COPING SKILL you've ever had? 

Couple all that with looking around me at people who say they love me but refuse even to offer to help despite my asking? Some don't know how or can't, but from here it looks like I have no loved ones, except for my mom, Thomas, and my brother probably. If no one who cares wants to help me get this gastric bypass then I just don't see any other way but death at this point, cause that's where I'm headed anyway.

Maybe in 50 years or so when insurance companies learn that it's better to just help people with this then let us suffer for so long we choose the easy way out someone will still be able to look back and realize what happened to me. That I felt I had no choice and not a single person in the world that could help me would stand beside me, a fellow human. Maybe someone will finally see all of you for what you truly are.

I am done with other humans. I done with pretending. I'm done watching you enjoy your cruises and vacations, throwing away money that could literally save my fucking life at this point. For these reasons, I can no longer stand to Fakebook. I will not be dead, for now, but I want to die, and many of you have held a daily part in that thanks to social media. You won't see me here, anymore. If I have to do this alone, none of you deserve to watch me succeed. If the pain is still too much, even without the daily reminders that you care enough to list me as a friend but won't actually help me when I need it and I'm ready for a change, then I will have no choice but to end myself.",t2_2ew7nkkt,3,0

I think I'm done,"I've (23m) spent the last five years living in poverty with an old childhood friend (23M). He was orphaned right before he turned 18 and spent a year homeless before we reconnected and moved in together. He's been struggling with severe PTSD from it, and at times was doing worse than I am now. My fiance (22F) also moved in with us when she finished high school, throwing away any plans for college in doing so. We've been struggling for years, both financially and mentally. I was the primary breadwinner between the three of us, and was able to avoid several attempts at taking my life by convincing myself that I was needed. 

Now I feel like I can finally rest. My roommate's mental health has drastically improved, to where he wants to go to college and start living on his own. He's even considering getting a loan and moving into a dorm! As for my fiance, she's been given the opportunity to work on her dream job, where she'll be making more than the three of us make now combined. They're both better off without me, and I mean that in an objective way. My fiance and I are poly, and I've developed feelings for my roommate. My roommate and I have actually talked about this before, where he said he had no romantic interests in us whatsoever. Despite that, three years have passed and the feelings persisted. He doesn't need someone like that in his life, especially when he inevitably meets someone in college and falls in love. I frankly think it'll be torture watching someone you can't shake feelings for fall in love with someone else. And as for my fiance, she has dreams and aspirations, unlike me. We even joked that with all the money she'll make, I can be a househusband. I have no hobbies or real skills, which means I'll just be bored out of my mind for the rest of my life.

"I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, but somehow I’ve still manage to fall deeper (transgender)","I haven’t ever felt this suicidal in my whole life. I just want to be seen as a normal human being. 
Hello, I’m transgender female to male. I haven’t had anything medical done and I’m in high school. 

The dysphoria and discomfort of not feeling okay in my own skin is so overwhelming, I can’t take it anymore. I need something to change.. but I’ve done everything possible in order to pass that I know of. I’ve spent hours looking online for something I’ve missed; some secret that guys do in order to actually be seen as a guy. 
I’ve started going to a support group and although it did give me hope, it’s also made me feel even worse. There’s this one guy there who’s already 5 years through his transition, I’m so envious. 
All I’ve been able to think about this past two months is how many different ways I can hurt myself and utilize the objects around me. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve thought about jumping out of my car while doing 60-70 down the interstate. 
The only reason I’m still alive is because of my family, otherwise I would have killed myself three/four years ago. I know this place isn’t necessarily for transgender rants, but I don’t know where else to put it without it getting taken down before I can get any real feedback. 

I’m 5’2, I have an undercut and my hair is longer on top. All my clothes are men’s, I wear boxers, my chest is semi flat (even without the binder) and I have masculine mannerisms. I’ve trained my voice to be deeper, but it’s still so fucking feminine. If it wasn’t for my voice I probably wouldn’t be misgendered. I’m so depressed, my medication just keeps going up and I’m still depressed. I have mental breakdowns regularly. I don’t sleep much, or I over sleep. I either don’t eat or eat on and off. I’m antisocial and awkward. I have absolutely no friends, and I just started at a new school a month ago. 
I tried getting my teachers to call me he/him even at the cost of using my birth name, but I have to get parents permission. I want to start testosterone, but I need both parents signature. My father isn’t even in the picture, and my mother thinks it’ll all go away over time. 

I haven’t cut in almost a year, but that’s all that’s ran through my mind in the last few hours. I self harm often, but never draw blood or really leave a mark. 

I’ve went through therapists and none of them made any progress with me. Everything I do to cope only lasts for a little bit, then I’m back to being unstable. None of my coping mechanisms work anymore. I’m so unstable. 

I just want my families approval. I want to make them proud and get a college degree.. 

But at this rate, I won’t make it to my junior year.",t2_5b824kbt,3,0
I'm just a burden on society. I should just end my suffering,"I've suffered severe depression for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was constantly bullied at secondary school. 

I've been diagnosed with plain simple depression. Not that there's anything plain simple about depression, it feels pretty complicated and horrible to me. Even if others think that there's no such illness and I should stop being depressed.

I would if I could, but it's not like there's a switch is there? 

The last few weeks have been so mentally fatiguing. I'm mentally drained and losing my fight with depression. I feel the darkness engulf more and more with each passing day. 

Will I wake up tomorrow? I hope not, as it will be yet another pointless struggle against pointless mediocrity. I have lost interest in everything apart from going back to bed. But my sleep is constantly disrupted. I can't win. 

Finally reached out to people who I thought were friends. Turns out they were bullies as well. They take great delight and joy from my pain and misery. Now they've realised I'm an emotional wreck, there nasty comments are all I think about. 

I think everyone feels this way, and everyone is right. I should just kill myself and stop being such a pollutant burden on everyone, and to society. 

Why can't I be happy like the people I see
Why aren't they suffering too
What even is happiness 

Society doesn't want me. No one wants me. Whats the point in life when everything is so needlessly complicated all the time. Why are people so hard to understand 

Earlier I took a load of antidepressants. It turns there's slim to no chance of overdosing this way. So another disappointment

While this makes me sad to hear, it is also reassuring to know that my parents would be able to heal and get past my death if I do decide to go through with it. Doesn’t make me feel as guilty.

I'm so scared of leaving this world and leaving others in pain, but i'm also in so much pain.

I've thought I've been depressed and suicidal in the past. This current state makes those look like a walk in the park.,"I'm just so broken and empty inside. I found true happiness in life. Then that happiness actively turned me away. 

As bad as I've felt in the past and been depressed and suicidal, I got over it. I didn't even know what happiness was. 

This time everything is just so much worse. There is only one thing in life I want and it's not an option. 

I just don't know what to do. Having actually felt happy and knowing it will never happen again is the absolute worst feeling in the world. 

When you don't know what happiness is it's easy to imagine it and have hope. But when you luck into finding it, but it's not an option, you don't even have that glimmer of hope no matter how small it is anymore. 

It's so easy to just say oh you'll find other happiness or things will get better. But in my case no I won't. I found actual real genuine happiness. All other happiness will be measured against that and not live up to it. Things aren't going to get better. That's clear. 

I just can't keep living like this. In the past I've gotten over these feelings after usually just a few days. It's been two months now. All I do is go to work, come home get in bed and cry/sleep until I work again. Two fucking months of nothing but being at absolute rock bottom.",t2_bmt1f,1,0

I’m only 17 years old and in college. Nothing has changed in my life. Neglect, mental abuse, and past relationships with sexual abuse.

Nothing hurts me more than my own mind. I’ve attempted suicide without having to think about it many times. It’s systematic for me. I wake up, swallow a crap ton of pills, cry, and puke.

The more it happens, the less people care and push me away. I’m completely on my own. I don’t live with my parents, my best friend, who I lived with over the summer, has been pushing me away since I started going to college.

I'm ready to end my life.,"I have no family left at all. My mom died almost 2 years ago. She was the last family member I had. At the time of my mother's death I was dating a girl I thought was going to become my wife. She talked about the kids we would have and what our house would look like. She planned all these trips together for us. I never had someone talk so much about how much they wanted to be with me. I caught her cheating on about a week before my mom died. My now exgirlfriend was sleeping with another guy. Completely lost interest in me as soon as my mom was hospitalized and never even had the courage to tell me she was sleeping with someone else. A week later I buried my mom. I gave a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs because no one bothered to show up. While that was going on the girl I once loved was half way across another state dropping her panties for another guy. 

Now she's married to a different guy. She's pregnant by this new guy and starting a family with him. I was robbed of the grieving time I should have had over my mom. I have no one in this world. The only shoulder I can cry on I have to pay for. This is justice. This is what they call karma. 

I think I'm going to just blow my brains out. Whats the point? I will never trust another woman enough to date. I'm almost in my 40s now. Inside in deeply broken by all of this. I'm sick of people telling me to just forget about my ex and think about my mom. I can't stop the nightmares. I can't stop the thoughts. I see my ex's face on other people all the time.

i don't think anyone takes me seriously anymore.,"hi, i made this account in hopes of finding support or advice or, i don't know, solace? feeling heard?

i'm 23 years old and have been having suicidal thoughts for 14 years. i guess i didn't realize how much of an issue it *still* was, as i'd stopped harming myself back in high school and have lived a mostly functional life, until this past august when i mentioned to my therapist that i thought about it all day, every day. it's hard to describe, though, because it's not like all of those thoughts are me actively *wanting* to die, but since it's been such a constant thing since i was nine years old, it's kind of just become a routine background thought process. 

since then, we've been working to lessen the frequence with which i have suicidal ideation and it's working, but i still deal with it from time to time and reach out to some trusted sources (my girlfriend, therapist, mom, and/or some closer friends) when it gets dangerous. 

the problem, however, is that i don't think anyone takes me seriously when i talk about wanting to kill myself or having different methods in mind to follow through with the idea. sometimes, it sort of feels like the person i'm talking to responds like, ""oh, i'm sorry :("" and then changes the subject or doesn't respond further. i should make it clear that because i've always worried this would happen, i make sure the occasions in which i reach out to these trusted sources are *very* few and far between; somewhere in the ballpark of ~ten times a year. most of these people also have a copy of a list my therapist helped me come up with in order to help dissuade me from taking action when in a crisis situation and have agreed to use some of the prompts/questions/reminders within the list but default to, ""that sucks /:"" when i try to talk to them about this. 

i've done everything possible to make sure the people i reach out to are comfortable with handling this subject matter and feel equipped to offer the support i need when it happens, but lately it just feels like no one believes me and therefore i should follow through with it so they know i was being serious. situations like these seem to exacerbate my suicidal ideation.

i'm sorry if this just seems like pointless or aimless rambling... i tried to keep it fluid but am exhausted and this is never an easy thing to talk about.

I'm in such a bad place and I can't ever seem to get out of it. It's unbearable,My mind is constantly thinking about suicide all day. Every day. It has been for about seven years. I've seen all the therapists and tried all the medications. I've tried all the lifestyle changes and alternative therapies. I am so stuck I am so bad I am so helpless. My brain is so empty and numb. If you scanned my head you'd probably find that my brain had disappeared. Everything hurts. I don't fit in anywhere and nothing can help me. I am desperate for relief from this and I have been searching for so long to find solutions and nothing ever comes from them. Spent thousands and traveled many miles and it has all felt pointless. Fuck seriously I hate all this so fucking much it's UNBEARABLE and it doesn't go away. I can't cry as I'm too numb. I've been told that I am developing schizophrenia though it feels like I have every mental illness there is. I feel doomed. I can't take this. There are no options left as I have tried everything that is legal. I have been to the hospital and they chat to me then send me home. It's hopeless. I don't know what to do I am so scared of suicide and it's always on my mind you know? I don't know what else to say. It feels unbearable and it's so upsetting to always be like this.,t2_17gze7,2,0
what makes life enjoyable or worth living to u,"tell me what makes life worth it to you, reasons to give life another chance after chances

what makes therapy worth it when I've been on for 2 years, ive seen at least ten different psychotherapists.

what makes friends and family important to me when I feel nothing but hurting

what makes my wellbeing important when I loathe every part of myself and how 2 years of effort to recovery does completely nothing. Nothing. Nothing but worse.

what gives things a meaning, or anything to have a meaning

These are what I deal with, I have a shit load of disorderly conduct.

- dissociative amnesia, memory loss
- bipolar, derealization, depersonalization
- bpd, separation anxiety, paranoia, delusions
- ptsd, mdd, bulimia, ocd, i starve myself all the time

Love is quite the battlefield isn't it,"On May 30th last year I found the love of my life, they were the absolute best person someone could ever meet, and for the first time in years I was happy. I had been planning on killing myself at the end of the summer, but them entering my life changed that. Unfortunately almost a month ago, February 12th, they left me for another dude, and things between them just keep advancing. Yesterday my ex had their first sexual experience with him, not sex or anything, but still touching of those parts ya know... we had never got the chance to do anything like this because we live 4000km apart, but now I just need to sit on the sidelines and watch while he gets all that shit I've been wanting for almost a year after only a few weeks. And now earlier today my ex was trying to figure out ways to ""make him feel good"" I'll let you guys figure out what that entails. So I'm thinking now that they're gonna be losing that virginity sometime soon, so right there is a huge fuck my life. But the biggest part of why I wanna end my life right now is really just because i wanna be their boyfriend again, and i wan t them to be my partner again... I just wanna be theirs again... I wanna turn back time to the start of the year and keep things from going to shit... I wanna be happy with them again and give them happiness... but now Icant do any of that, and now if i cant have any of that, I wanna kill myself, I dont want to live anymore, my life other than them is pointless, they give me meaning, but without them, I'm just here left to feel pain, I just want to die, I don't want my life, I want to throw it away. They sent me a Yoshikage Kira tie a little before the whole shit happened on February 12th, I wanna hang myself with that tie. I wanna do something to kill myself... so yeah, that's all... moral of the story is, if you're scared that someone may steal your partner, odds are you're right. And moral of the story number 2 is obvious, that I wanna slit my throat, or blow my brains out, or any number of ways I could kill myself, I'm really just rambling now I dont even know what I'm saying, I'm not ok",t2_mc9x0,8,0
Everyone thinks I’m fine but I’m not,"I just feel so out of place that it’s starting to hurt. It’s so hard trying to pretend I’m okay but I’m really not. I need help but I also don’t want to ask for help. The pain is sooo unbearable I just want it to end. I just want to be happy but I’m reminded of reasons not to be. I feel so alone and there’s no one to talk to. All I wanted was to have friends, good friends that will lift me up and be there when I need help. For us guys it’s so hard cos society tells you to “man up” cos men don’t have emotions. Truth is I feel weak sometimes and it’s hard showing it. I put on a tough face but deep down I just want to scream. Keeping all this pain in is soo hard that sometimes I feel like I’m suffocating",t2_4v8sgtv5,3,0
Vicious Circle,"I've been thinking about ending my life, but everything seems so painful. This is not the US, so it's not that easy to get a gun (what I think it might be the fastest way and convince myself that with one I'd be gone in a second) and I don't want anything gruesome either.

What kept me going for a few days was Prozac without prescription. I don't have a job to pay for therapy or anything. In those prozac weeks I felt like eating optimistic pills. Later on I noticed that I was clumsy, forgetful and just dumb, so I left them. It has been maybe a month since that, and just today the suicidal thoughts stroke me like lightning. I don't know what to do, I feel like my time is running out in this lack of will and want, I just feel so godamn lifeless already.

I'm thinking over and over to get a shitty job at a drug store or whatever, just to pay for therapy and whatever I might need, but I also think that if I take that job, my life will be miserable, because I've tried jobs like that in the past, and it just makes me angry to loose my life in a meaningless way.

"How to make a mess from your own, perfectly fine life","I feel like that could have been a great life, full of things that people call ""success"", full of joy and other emotions. I'm 18 and looking at my situation somebody would say that it looks perfect. I'm in last year of high school, going to study violin in Switzerland which is regarded as a great success in my country. 

And that everything means nothing to me now, just because somewhere along those ride I went too deep in philosophy. It made me feel different in many ways. I don't have similar and even acceptable views on morality, human interactions, and nearly any other aspect of social life. You could say, that most of the time my positions are well though out (though not necessarily right) but what does it all matter, if it means that it is immensely hard to find any companion for a satisfying talk? Of course it would not be a problem if there was no drive for social interactions.

And so begins my worst everyday nightmare. The fight between primal drives, and what my brain decided is rational and best for me in the long run. 

Every time I meet with friends I do this just to get my instinct satisfied. I almost never feel later that it was a time well spent. That feeling after meeting with someone is very rare, but it happens every time I get to talk about philosophy, sociology, science and other topics like that. To that I have to add my sexual drive, which especially gets me mad. It makes me run after people that I have almost nothing in common, and that could never make me truly happy, just because I haven't have sex for some time now. 

I feel sick, deprived from normal look on the world, full of expectations that I'm struggling to meet, which only drives me to more self hatred. I suffer from genetic skin desease that makes me ugly. I don't know how to talk to people on anything not-serious anymore. I hate myself for wanting any romantic relationship. I wish I was asexual.

 Because of no problems earlier in my life I don't even know if I can write here and be taken seriously with such pitiful bumps, existing really only in my head, but I just want any help, any indication of what should I do now. Continue my struggle to become a man from my imagination even though psychology says it cannot be done or what? I feel like not going this way would be a failure of the entire life.

A Note,"I've dealt with depression for at least 5 years now. I tried everything I could on my own to feel better: eating well, working out, good sleep schedule, etc. Nothing worked. I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much. I now switched to computer science, I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me, but I'm still so unhappy. It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor, as I didn't want to worry my parents about it. But finally I did, a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti-depressant (Lexapro). I was so so hopeful that this would help me, but unfortunately things only got worse and worse. These past 2 months have been the absolute worst months of my life. I'm failing classes (because I missed so many lectures/assignments), I have no money, no job, I've isolated myself so much, I just feel like I can't do anything. I now feel as if I've exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don't know what I can do anymore...

I have no desire to be in this world anymore. I feel like I'm just not cut out for it, and I'm okay with that. There's so many other people out there, my life is so small and meaningless anyway, so what's it matter? It sadly doesn't seem like it's worth all the trouble anymore. And so many people have depression nowadays, it's so sad. I just fucking hate it here.

The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things. I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave.

Well if anyone actually read this, thanks. I've been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I've been feeling but I feel like I can't put all this weight on their shoulders.

And honestly, I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying. But I don't think I even have the desire to do that anymore. It doesn't seem worth it, I just want out.

stuck,"I'm stuck

There was a point in my life where I really wanted to die. 

Now, I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I live a relatively privileged life. My family is kind, I have good friends, I go to a privileged school. I get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. The world around me is beautiful. But I don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling like I wanted to die. No idea why. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no mental illnesses that I know of. I just hated my soul. Not myself. I hated the being I had created. I was in pain. I am a very appreciative person. And that has become my downfall. I appreciate the world around me so much that I have diminished myself as a human being. I love everything. And I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling continued for a long time. But now I have reached a point where I realized that I am not worthy of feeling sad. That I am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. Because I am privileged and I am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sad, then I feel angry, then I feel depressed, then I feel suicidal, then I feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then I want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I were to kill myself, I would cause so much pain to all the people around me. They would think I was selfish to do that. Do i really exist just to please other people? Am I just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. Then I sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. Because I'm not supposed to be sad. I'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was never born. Then I could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. Because I was never there in the first place. But now I'm stuck here. I only matter when I want to leave. Otherwise, I'm meaningless. But perhaps I shouldn't pity myself. After all, that would be awfully selfish of me.

What if I could pull this off,"I am tired of being stuck, tired of not being the person I know I could be. I am trying really hard not to make this another negative post. For the last 2 years or so I just stayed the same person. Sometimes I can't even tell if I am depressed or not because I don't have feelings, I have anhedonia and have a hard time even enjoying my favorite music. I barely exist, I pretend everything is okay because I get ignored when I am open about my feelings because no one around me knows how to help me. I wake up and want to go back to sleep again because I am constantly exhausted and want to escape reality. No one is taking me seriously, they belittle me because I don't study or have a job. They can't see themselves doing what I am about to do. I have all these wonderful visions and I know that someday they turn into reality. 

For once let's not focus on what is going wrong, let's find a way to get out of this and improve. I have nothing to lose if I decide to take baby steps into the right direction. I think the reason many people fail is because they want to solve too many problems at once or because they don't know where to start. I want to change one area of my life before I move to the next. I know that I am not able to go to the gym, eat healthy, meditate and all that shit at once so I won't do that. I want to minimize the chance of me going back to bad habits.

I waste a lot of time on my pc so the first step would be to unplug my monitor and place the cables somewhere in the basement. In my situation simply going down there to get everything I need to use my pc again is already too much work. Turning on my pc after waking up was always the path of least resistance (besides going back to sleep). If I make it harder to use my pc, I will be able to easily beat this habit. I will do this right after posting this.

Now I still have my smartphone. I already deleted apps like Twitch and Netflix and because the passwords I am using are just cryptic I won't be able to log in unless I reset my password which, you guessed it, is too much work for me. I still have YouTube installed because I have some great affirmation videos in my playlist which I think will help me. If I find myself watching useless content tomorrow I will also delete YouTube.

For the next days I will probably just stay in bed because I can't use my pc or smartphone to waste time. After that I will highly likely automatically start to read books. I hope when I don't play video games, watch videos or series and don't listen to music for a while I will have more energy and motivation for things like going to the gym because my brain can rewire itself to some degree.

After this I want to clean my room and go to bed at the same time every single day. I have some other things on my list but won't go into more detail because I already wrote too much.

If I don't show up here next week, it probably worked and I am slowly fixing my life. I don't really expect anyone to read this, it was really just a post for myself. Good luck.",t2_5ehmks5h,2,0
I needed to Vent,"I've struggled with major depression, anxiety, and a few other mental illnesses for many years now.
It's a rollercoaster, sometimes I'm okay, then I'm not.

 The past few years, I've been constantly tired*. Lately, it had gotten worse partially due to a the death of my grandma and other stuff in my life.
I've been feeling so tired, numb, irritated, and not caring about my life. I just want it all to end. 
I can't keep track of time anymore. 
My memory keeps getting worse. Everything i knew in highschool, i don't know anymore.

I joke a lot about it, but its gotten to the point that no one takes me seriously , and I don't think I want them to.  

My soul feels heavy with grief, pain, deep sorrow, and numb at the same time...

There's times when I daydream about just ghosting my life and runaway, but that all sounds exhausting.
I keep daydreaming about suicide.

I'm really struggling atm and don't know what to do :(,"I have had suicidal thoughts for a while now but the past few weeks have been especially bad. This is for several reasons. I mainly have trouble with friends, health anxiety, and my past.

Recently the trust I have with my friends was brought into question and I fell into a deep depressive state which I didn't think I'd emerge from. I feel better about it now, but it's still effecting how I perceive certain things. My health anxiety has also been on a downward spiral due to the corona virus fear mongering and some issues I've been having with chapped lips (this is very recent, as in today, and although it seems like a small thing is really triggering for me. Any small health issue is at this point.). I also have ongoing issues with coming to terms with my past and the actions of my parents and family members as well as my own.

I've also recently developed some concerns about my mental state as now more than ever I've been experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. Maybe I'm being over the top when I say this but I fear it may be true as recently I've been arguing with myself vocally, and getting angry at my own thoughts to the point where I will verbally reply. It may sound normal on paper to some extent, but I believe it's different to simply talking to myself considering how I say things. 

I also fear I'm becoming delusional as I've been starting to think everyone around me is against me to an extreme degree. Sometimes I find myself looking at friends from a perspective that feels like I don't know them. I look at them and wonder why I am friends with them and if they even exist. I'm constantly questioning everything around me as if I was born yesterday to believe my life is what it is. I can't make sense of anything. The world, life, none of it. I don't understand anything and feel like it's all some elaborate lie or something. 

I also want to self harm all the time but recently haven't as I've scared myself due to how bad its been before. Once I scraped my head across a carpet so hard the skin on my forehead tore. I once cut my face with a broken hairbrush as well as the backs of both my hands. I've also cut and bitten and burnt, as well as slapping myself repeatedly for hours over and over forcing myself to cry.

Many nights I will force myself to cry as well. I used to do this with self harm but now due to being more sensitive I can achieve the effect simply through sad film scenes and songs.

Music used to be a relief for me but no longer is. I used to be able to listen to music to either help myself feel happier or wallow in my sorrow, both of which were at least some sort of release for me. But now none of it works and music just irritates me more than helping me get into a specific mood. I'm devoid of emotion at this point and feel like I'm just going along on a predetermined track.

Basically that's everything. I've also done things like sticking my hands in very hot water for extended periods but idk if that falls under self harm or just some weird thing I do.

Sorry its so long. Just wanted to put it all in writing. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. I'm planning on killing myself if things aren't on the up by the end of the week. Idk how yet but have some ideas. Just so anyone reading this is aware. Thanks again.",t2_3wr2pxcl,3,0

My school would never let me perform again. They won’t even let me try out. Then I get treated like shit all the time. I get called stupid fat and ugly (even though it’s all bullshit).

Hello eveyone,"Hi. My name is Chris, this is the first time I'm posting here, but I've been around here for a little while.

I don't know whats wrong with me. My life is pretty good if I analyze it objectively, but I just can't bring myself to be happy or find any motivation to keep going forward. Nothing bad has happened to me recently, and there have been some small good things even, but still... I don't want to keep going. I know I'll eventually be happy again if I keep going, I have no doubt in my mind about it, but I also know I'll eventually be sad again. And I'm not so sure that those happy moments are worth all that suffering.

To me it seems like everyone is just happy by default. Maybe they get sad or depressed if something bad happens, but then everybody goes back to being ok. For some reason it's opposite with me, I get happy if something good happens, but then I always go back to being sad. Being sad it's just my default state, and I don't want it to be.

Taking money from my parents for university, and after failing classes I’m not even close to graduating. I’m the backup friend in every group, the one that could always slip away without being noticed. I don’t want to put my pain or problems on anyone. They don’t care and they have much more important things to worry about. My gf is embarrassed to be with me and bring me around her friends. I’m useless and do not contribute anything to anyone’s life other than pain.",t2_hte5t0a,4,0
To Go with a Smile,"Why am i different? I have really nice friends, i have a great family, i had a nice girlfriend and a good social life. Since half a year i play in a lovly team soccer, we loose always, but its a great team, i enjoy every second to train with them.
Im livin in a great home. I got everything in here i need like a good pc, a ps4, a nice kitchen and so on.
Im working /worked but now im injured. Great money, not rich or something, but great money in my opinion. 
I think about the poor souls in africa, siberia or i dont know, kids work and so on. I think, they have to work so hard and much for nothing or go to sleep without to eat and drink and feel sad for them.
I should be happy with my fcking life. I have passions and goals, im depressed, i guess, but i enjoy a lot of things.
Buuuut, im 27 years old now and since around 10 years i think about this. Its like music i dont want to listen to, but its in my head. 
Its really hard to explain. I dont want to live this classic life. I dont want to work my hole life, maybe find a girl and marry her, get a baby, work until im old, become ill in a lot of ways and someday, when all the people i loved died before me than i die and it is like i never touched this world.its like i can see my hole life.
 I thought, maybe when im older, things change. For example in school i thought. Get a girl and work a bit. It will change. It dont changed.
 Or i thought. Chase your dreams like do this, go there, change yourself. I did this and the feeling is still there.
And the worst thing is, if i could win a lot of money, i would stop to work and enjoy a lot of years with traveling and so on. But in the end, i would have the same feeling. Just delayed.
I know, its really hard to understand. My Therapist, i had for like 2 month said, he cant understand me, my friends dont and im not sure i understand my own feelings. The only thing that stopped me till today is, that i dont want to go to hell and, i dont want to leave my family and friends sad and maybe damaged for their lives, but theres no escape and i want to do it.
Right know i plan to get a credit for around 10 to 20 thousend and enjoy my last summer on earth with my best friend traveling to japan, thailand, hawai and maybe another place with amazing food, amazing places, girls and sports. This credit will be low enough, so no one have to pay it back, if im gone forever.
I will give some money to family and friends and the team.
Why i write this? I have no fcking clue. I will write a lot of letters, record a bit for youtube so everyone i think has to know it, will see, what i go trough.
Since i made my decision, i feel free. All the things i want to do, i will do soon.And than, im just gone ,with a smile on my face. The ultimate Goal.
I love u all.

"what is it to be ""depressed"" and how can one tell?","I've been in a very positive relationship recently and am not currently posing a threat to myself or others, but that still doesnt nullify my past. I'm only 17, I have a very supportive and loving family, but i've always managed to find a way to hate myself and others. Ive landed myself in therepy twice: first, calling the suicide hotline and accidentally ordering a fucking cps raid on my house (big mistake, i just wanted a friend to talk to) and second I tried to hang myself a year later and left a fairly obvious red burn + bruise around my neck. Both times I visited therepy sessions, i spent all of my time talking to the counselors lying. I refused to be labed depressed. I didn't want the stigma and sideways glances from my friends and family. For some reason, I saw this label of depression as a bad thing. I always did everything i could to avoid a diagnosis. After CPS got callef called after I opened up to the lady on the text line, i was afraid to be honest. I lied about my attempts, i lied about being sad, i lied about a lot. At the end I ironically tried to get a diagnosis to get on meds but I had lied so far the doctor refused to believe me and said I wasnt depressed, so thags cool. I've spent a LOT of time using the free crisis textline and i've never been able to pin if im actually depressed or if I'm making all this shit up. I really dont know. Im terrible and analyzing myself and my girlfriend gets very concerned when i tell her ""i dont know"" when she asks when i'm depressed. Its the truth. I dont actually know. I have a perfect life. Family, money, friends, a girlfriend, everything. I still can't help but want to kill myself. I've spent HOURS researching the subject and I know the statistics and efficiency of all of the methods of suicide. I even know exactly how i'd do it if i ever get in that situation again. So, does that make me suicidal? Depressed? Bipolar? Or am i just another idiot in the world who blows up his problems to get attention? Who knows? I dont really know whats wrong with me, or how i'm ever gonna fix it. Im perfectly fine with living life a broken man, been doin it for 3+ years (first attempt) and im ready to come out of the closet as the first non-depressed depressed person. I'm ranting and i'm running out of things to say but i still want to keep typing. A few tips for all those depressed teens going through a rough time out there. Don't rely on others to vent to. I know it sounds and feels nice, but they leave. They always leave. It will fuck you up when you lose your only coping method, and it aint gonna be fun. Dont do that. I know you get all that ""just dont be sad"" bullshit but you got this. Personally i'm a pussy and cant commit to an attempt for real, but attempting is part of the realization that its not worth it. If you have the want to attempt, dont. Wait 2 weeks, and if you feel the same way about life, i wont stop you. Just remember. Theres no way out. Once you kick the stool, or jump off the bridge, theres no takebacks. You wont be able to see the sea turtles in the ocean, you wont be able to see the next cool superhero movie, it all goes away. Your family will spend all the money for your funeral, youll never meet your nieces and nephews, youll never meet the girl you were fated to fall for, and worst of all, youll destroy the people around you. Family, friends, even your school or workplace. Sure the storm will pass and you will eventually be ""forgotten"" as you guys like to morbidly put it, but all non-celebrities are forgotten when they die. That girl who got hit by a drunk driver a year ago was forgotten, it doesn't really matter who you are, but it does matter why youre here.

i know nobody else cares. “oh you are only 16, it wasn’t a real relationship, it only gets worse”

"I don't even know anymore, my head is about to explode","I don't know where to begin. When someone asks why I'm feeling so bad, I just say ""Yes"".

I'm 22 years old and everything I have ever experienced or done, in regards to everything, has gone wrong. Not a single thing has gone well. Not the things I can change (like finding friends, getting a girlfriend, making money), not the things I cannot change (my overall health, how my family has shaped).

I feel and see that anything I do is absolutely pointless, there are no results anywhere to be found. And I can cope with myself, I am just fine, I don't even care that I am miserable, poor, have no friends, nobody will ever love me and I will die alone, as long as I don't get reminded.

What do I mean by that? Getting reminded? When I speak to people and they are overly happy, it makes me want to puke. When I see a happy couple together, my blood pressure shoots up and I get really angry. And I feel like everyone is going out of their way just to piss me off/show me what they have and I don't.

I feel, tss, feel, I KNOW, that nobody in the real world gives a flying donkey about me. Sometimes, when I start thinking about it for a while, I realize just how screwed my life is, and that I probably should have killed myself years ago, and that people who were like me are probably already dead. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

I'm not even crying, I just feel like my cheeks are full of tears and are just dragging my face down. And that this place in my chest, where the heart and soul are supposed to be, I feel like there's nothing left.

End of the road for me,"Enoughs enough, my mental state will not improve and I have tried multiple things to try combat it.

I have major trust issues which seriously ruins my life, i can no longer be confident in anything, develop any relationships without leaving me in a constant state of paranoia of ones intentions.   i question everything in my head and always think theres a alternative behind everything.

I carry a substantial amount of debt which is completely due to my poor life decisions which causes a serious amount of stress, I have even started losing my hair at the age of 24 because of it. 

Relationship I have just come out of has ruined me mentally. I have been cheated on(i forgave), constantly had to question her faithfulness, suffered mental abuse and constantly been made to feel like I am a piece of shit.

What’s put the nail in the coffin is I just recently discovered that a friend who i would of classed as a brother has been going behind my back with my ex girlfriend(we split up properly a few weeks ago so the wound is still fresh).

I'm wondering - is this the end?," 

I'm not sure why I'm typing this. This will be a congealed mess of words, I'm hoping someone can relate - though I'm not sure what anyone can do to help me.

I am in a great situation compared to others, I'm not in a warzone, I'm not abused, I have no reason to feel this way. I was 13 when I first had these feelings. Self harm, eating disorder, depression, anxiety - my first suicidal thoughts. I became better, but I spiralled down again. I realise I was never better, but the good days outweighed the bad days.

I'm now the worst I've ever been. Though I've matured now. Self admitted to therapy, doctors referrals, everything I could do - I've tried. I am not self harming, skipping meals but I'm the worst I've ever been. I should be happy that I'm 18 now, I can drive, go get smashed at the club - yet nothing. The anxiety is through the roof, it feels like I'm drowning. My teenage happy years feel like they have been stolen from me, did I deserve this? Probably not. No-one deserves it.

I suffer from a couple chronic illnesses, they stop me leaving the house. I am missing a lot of college, I am going to be kicked out soon - I know it. I have been an open book to them. Every doctors note, therapy note they have scanned to their system. But I can't keep going. I don't see a future for me. I wonder what my future will be like, but I can only see now. Tonight isn't the night I'm leaving my past behind - but I know soon I'll bite the bullet.

I just wish there was more support for men. I haven't tried any medications for this illness, the doctors have rejected it. I think that was my last chance of hope.

My Suicide Note (Draft),"Dear friends and family,  


I've lost my long battle with my thoughts. I'm taking my own life.  


What I am going to do is inexcusable and I know I'm going to put a lot of people through a lot of pain. I can't pretend that I won't be missed, I am making my decision with that very much at the forefront of my mind. My suicide is selfish to be sure. But I can't keep living just because of what is essentially a feeling of guilt. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I am deeply sorry.  


I also want you to know that I don't blame anybody. Especially not my parents. I am going into the grave at peace in this regard. You shouldn't blame yourself either. Anybody who knows me well, knows that I've had suicidal tendencies for a long time. I'm sick of making what are basically just thinly veiled threats. It's time for me to take action, and take control.  


I blame myself for everything. Every day I am doing new things that I'm going to feel insecure about later. All of these things mounting on top of each other and fuelling my anxiety to become worse and worse. It never gets better, existing just feels like continuous torment and struggle. I can't play that game anymore. I'm sorry friends and family, I love you, but I'm making the selfish decision. I hope you find a way to heal the hole that I leave.  


I love you,

Backwards thinking,"People always say ""think about your loved ones"" but why should I think about them when they're not trying to help me? The only thing I'm going to be thinking about when I'm dead is what is the afterlife like? I honestly won't miss any of the people on this planet because none of my relationships lasts. I have no friends, ZERO, and I don't get along with any of my family members. If I wasn't living with my mother I probably would never speak to her. If somebody claims to care about you shouldn't they be there for you even if it's about suicide?  My mother will be there for me about stupid stuff like somebody being rude to me at work and she'll get so passionate about it and say things like ""Don't let them talk to you like that, etc."" But then my mother acts like she doesn't want to talk about suicide ""because it's too painful to talk about"" as if not talking about it is going to prevent me from thinking about it when it's the opposite. I don't feel like I have anybody to talk to about my suicidal thoughts because nobody wants to talk about it because they don't want me bringing their mood down. People act as if they don't want to talk about suicide until it happens but by then it's too late. And when I did talk to her about suicide once nothing changed, she cared for a few minutes and then everything just went back to normal. How do I make her realize that suicide isn't something that you can magically solve in one day? I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 7 years old. Almost everyday is a battle for me to fend off the negative thoughts. I can go for months having good days and I can also go for months having bad days feeling hopeless. When I was young I was naive enough to think one day I won't feel this way anymore but here I am at age 27 still having the same thoughts. I even heard an older woman in her 60's at my job saying she wished that she was dead. Will life ever get better for me? Years ago I went months feeling happy but now it feels like I'll never get back to that place like I'm constantly chasing happiness but I can never catch up.",t2_29iy86b,8,0
In a weird state between wanting to keep pushing vs going off the cliff’s edge,"Hey everyone,

I know I’m not alone here, hence why I’m taking the time to write this post.

Recently, a lot of events took place that drove me to a very dark place. A good friend of mine I grew up skateboarding with since high school took his own life a few months ago. I was also in the midst of a strong LSD trip around the same time and I had suicidal ideations during the trip. Also during that time, I broke my arm, battled the flu for a couple weeks straight, received threats from multiple people stemming from stupid drama, and my roommates got into a full fledged fist fight which made the living situation very tough and bills got steep because of my ex-roommates moving out due to the altercation.

All these events put me on a gnarly manic episode so I had to turn myself into the psych ward. That shit felt like prison. I wasn’t able to go outside at all during the entire stay. They were pumping me with lithium, trazodone, and 3 different drugs twice a day. The side effects were brutal. It made my sleep paralysis pop up a lot more than usual, and I heard very audible voices communicating directly with me when I was on those medications. I forced myself to put on a false smile at the facility so I can convince the staff to release me sooner rather than later due to “good behavior.”

Since getting out, I’ve been making a constant effort everyday to improve my overall health. I meditate everyday, and I’m getting back into a workout routine since my arm is almost fully healed. Going back to the medications though, I stopped taking them; I couldn’t handle the side effects anymore. I am seeking therapy though. And I do actively reach out to my mother and loved ones about this situation. However, during my therapy sessions, I left out one crucial detail. I still have suicidal thoughts creeping up. I’m scared that I’ll be locked up in the psych ward again. Mental illness has this funny thing of reminding you that you’ve never good enough no matter how much you push or strive to get better. Everytime I make progress, I relapse in a hard hitting depressive episode. It’s also been like this since day one. I have high functioning depression. On the outside, I have my shit together. I work a stable job and live on my own. I have healthy relationships with my mother and close friends. I practice lots of good habits like healthy eating, meditation, and exercise. But all that is just a cover up for how I really feel inside.

My high functioning depression stems from a lot of things. I dealt with a lot of trauma since birth. I never grew up with my dad, my mom went through two divorces, and she had to lie to me about who my real dad was until she told me the truth when I was 19 and was somewhat developed enough to grasp the concept. I also have Aspergers Syndrome, and struggled to make friends for a long time. I was also a victim of bullying, rape, and child abuse. On the flip side, I committed a lot of acts of true evil that have traumatized people for good, whilst tainting my soul and crushing my spirit. I’ve also have never been in a committed relationship; I’m almost 25 now...That left a bitter feeling of loneliness. I already grew up as an only child with zero childhood friends so it’s just added salt to the wound. This led me to a bad substance abuse phase that lasted for around 10 years and I’m just now turning the corner around that. However, despite whatever progress I make, like I stated before: mental illness has a funny way of reminding you that you ain’t shit when you least expect it, for no fucking reason at all. This shit also forced me to wear a mask to hide all these problems and the scary thing was that I was so good at hiding it, I convinced myself that I was ok, even though I really wasn’t deep down.

The only reason why I haven’t killed myself yet is because I would put my close friends through a lot of pain. And my mom would have it the worst. She would be beyond broken if I took my own life. But the pain is getting more and more unbearable by each waking second. Every morning I dread getting up, and I’m just using pure willpower at this point to keep pushing, for my loved ones. But holy shit, it is so draining. The two things that have kept me sane for a while (music, skateboarding) doesn’t hit like how it used to. It’s becoming more dull. Same with food. I only eat now cause I’m forcing myself to, knowing that I need those nutrients to survive. This feeling that has been lingering my whole lifetime is still present. No matter how much I fight it, it’s still there.

I can't control these feeling,"For as long as I can remember I have always put myself in pain. The earliest memory I have is sitting in my dad's truck under the hot Arizona sun and feeling the inside of the truck getting hotter and hoping my heavy breathing would pass me out. It never happened and I was only 6. From then on it was jay walking without looking, taking too much NyQuil, drinking excessive melatonin hoping I would just sleep forever. 

Now, I'm 22 and there's a Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun sitting in the closet whispering to me. There's a sharp butcher knife in the kitchen begging for me to use it on myself. And even a thick rope stored away in my backyard closet hoping for me to choose it. There's so many methods begging me to use but I'm scared. 

I know my emotions are a wack job and a lame excuse for my actions but I can't seem control them. I get in an adrenaline frenzy to escape and hope for a shootout or for a car to hit me straight on. Maybe even just turning on the car and inhaling those heavy breathes of CO2. 

I have nothing to live for. I make my boyfriend sad and angry half of the time. My parents love me unconditionally but I know I'm a disappointment. All my siblings are far apart and don't see as a sister. More as my father's bastard who they HAVE to interact with.

I want to end it all. There's no worth in my life if I can't even see a psychologist who I can't afford and I can't be a bigger burden to my boyfriend since he's my only outlet.

I want everyone to grieve me when I'm gone,"I've had dreams that I told people how dark my soul is from the manic depressive illness I have, and they always walk away out of shock or try to pretend like they don't hear because it's too much.

I don't care that things could get better.

I'm sick of the entire process of maintaining my bipolar mood swings and managing myself with meds. It's like climbing up a slippery staircase and every time I get close to the top, I slip down and have to restart. My doctor can only make my medication go up once more before I have to try new medications for my bipolar disorder and I really can't live with having to restart on new meds.

I'm sick of the ups, the downs, the neutrals, just everything. 

I don't care that I have a bright future.

I don't care how sad people will be when I'm gone. I want them to be sad. I want them to know the real me -- the dark me.

Even when I'm happy, the sun is shining, and I'm with my dog and singing out loud, I still ache for absolute nothingness.

For example, today I was trying to stay happy on my downtime where I had nothing to do, so I went on my PC to play games. I didn’t feel like playing, but I did anyway, and I went to talk to friends online too.

I then received a text that the one person I was looking forward to seeing on Saturday isn’t coming home until Monday, and then my WiFi went out. 

The timing couldn’t have been worse.

Anyone like to watch death vids online?,"One thing I am scared of is losing my independence.

I was hoping it would be him because he's 70 but he's going to last forever.

I got back into death vids and neck belting. I saw a vid of someone smashing their head wide open on a rock and fantasized, how can I do that? Today, I belted my neck unconscious. What excuse should I give in my 30 day resignation notice for my job? Also what methods do people know you who have completed suicide done. I don't want to do anything too messy like warfain and bleeding out.

One thing that was awesome, was in my late 30s I got down to a lower weight. Every time I hear about someone hanging on a curtain rod they are around 40 lbs.

Hello I feel like a crazy person,"Hi I'm new-ish to reddit so ya sorry if this post sucks but um lately I feel like I'm going insane everyday my fears get worse and worse like for example I'll think that someone is going to break in/ is already in my house if I hear the slightest noise. Or if I hear a plane flying really low or thunder or something ill think I'm gonna get struck by lightning or a plane is going to crash into my house, sometimes It even feels like I'm going to be bombed. I've imagined every loved one in my life dying and it's so scary. The slightest confirmation of my irrational fears makes me want to die even more cuz I'm scared of it happening and seeing my family suffer. I don't leave my house anymore and I hurt myself to cope. I even sometimes feel like paranormal things are out to get me like I'm surrounded by ghosts. Every day keeps blending together and I feel really pathetic that I'm doing nothing to help my family but it's so hard to muster any energy. I'm trying hard to cling on to certain milestones like my birthday or fun events I want to go to but it's hard.

My therapist is a good person and all but I just don't feel like therapy is working. I keep my feelings bottled up insede me and eventually they will erupts like they have already in the last three attempts.

Every day I like to fantasies my death but in the most horrible painful way. I want to commit even more everyday. I don't feel this as a bad place because the best career I have a chance at is the meth labs.

With all theese thoughts it means I cry to myself alit, but tonight my tears ran dry. My eyes hurt, i feel like 8ve cried to the point where I will cry no more. Today I feel more empty, less passionate and more heartless than before. I feel more like an asteroid waiting till that day where I plummit to the ground.

Life's not fair,"I've largely learned to be an adult on my own. I wasn't really raised, in fact I raised my younger siblings. I have no relationship with my biological father. I still talk to my mother, but sparingly. My step father was an awful person that beat me, insulted me, made me feel worthless, and molested me.

The only thing I ever truly learned from the adults in my life, is that life just isn't fair. We play the hand were dealt, this isn't ground breaking stuff, but it's all they gave me.

I moved out when I was 16. My stepdad had gone to jail and my mom was forced to move to section 8 housing that could fit her, and the 5 children she forced into this world. I refused to change schools again and move from the friends that I had.

I never had anything handed to me. I've worked very hard to get where I am. I beat the pattern. I got out of a bad house. I finished high school, I've never not worked. I made all the moves I could to move on from the past. Yet, as I lay here in bed, I can't stop thinking about ending my life. 

I've had thoughts of killing myself for as long as I can remember. It's not an everyday thing anymore, but it's still there. It still persists. 

I've fought this urge for a long time. I'll continue to fight. I won't take my life tonight, it doesn't seem fair to those I love, but alas, life isn't fair.

Tou know when you have that one person you want to talk to or hear from? That one single person that makes everything feel better, that means the world to you?

On my mind and im going crazy, bacause ill bet my life on them not even thinking about mez and at this point i want to see them suffer like they made me. Its vicious i know, but its all because of how careless this person is.

And im all alone, so fucking alone and the only thing i want is to die, because i just cant take life anymore.

For a small little hope of maybe acheiving happiness? No i cant strive for maybes thats more likely nothing in the end. 

I just wanna give up. All im waiting for is to find what way to go out. Thats my biggest struggle right now, nobody gives a shit about me so im not worried about whos gonna hurt when im gone - they shouldve seen me when i was alive and struggeling to even be a person.

Talked down by the person that trigger me to suicide,"There was a lot going on. My ex and I wasn't in a toxic relationship, well at least I didn't think it was. Few days ago, he wanted alone time and we had our fair share of time to think through things. 
Yesterday, I met him. I could see that he wanted to try again but at the end of the day, we are just not compatible. Apparently, i'm full of shit. 

I packed my things and was chased out of the house. He knew I was suicidal and yes, I have been planning to end my life in years. He was worried, and for the first time, he cried for me and begged me not to kill myself. I was shocked. Didn't know how to respond. 

Honestly, he isn't the reason why I wanted to end it. He was just the trigger, the last straw. I am just living borrowed time from my previous attempt. Idk why in that moment when I heard his cries, I felt angry at how everyone wants a depressed person to stay alive just so they don't have to go through the guilt and hurt. 

He talked me down, and honestly it's a blur. I don't really remember how i changed my mind... At the end of the day, he just didn't want to watch me die and he loves me. But we gtta fix ourselves first. I respected his decision. 

Tbh, I am still sour at how 2 people in the entire world found each other and yet, we can't be together due to the incompetence. I wish I was a better catch for him to keep.

Now I'm awake, going to work. It is so tough to pull through everything I have went through and the thought of smiling at everyone to put up a front, disgusts me. I honestly don't know if I can stay alive any longer. Losing him just made me even certain that there's something very wrong with me.

first of all im illiterate i barely finished 10th grade i was taken out by my parents for dumb reasons (another reason im suicidal) ive  had dyslexia since the 1st grade so idk why it was a great idea to take me out of school. i already have learning issues so lets make it harder for me please. im an 18 year old girl who cant get along with her family has no friends to run to when i cant stay home, im losing faith in God/humanity. i am christian but why does god hate me so much to make my life so miserable ?!?!? why do i try hard and still have this life !?!? no i dont have my GED or diploma i cant take it because 1 i have practiced online and i dont know 80% of the stuff bc again i didnt go to school and bc of my learning disability it makes it 5x as hard to study (even tho i still try, im not giving up). 2 my parents wont give me money to take it. 3 my mom said she wouldnt give me the money to take it because she has no faith in me. 4. ive been waiting 2 years to to get into a home schooling or a ged program they will not enroll me. why dont i get a job and pay for it ??. my parents wont give me my documents. why dont i report them because im an adult and they legally cant hold my documents (birth certificate, ID, SSN) because i dont wanna be homeless and im an adult so they could legally kick me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

 i wanna die bc whats the point of living !??!?! most kids at 18 have finished high school have a job arent fucking stupid like me are actually in college have friends social lives and are ready to move out while im still be treating like a kid getting my phone taken away have no money cant get a job cant get a license cant get an education because my parents wont let me. imagine wanting an education and your parent havenent put you in school in 4 years !?!?! and you couldnt do a thing about it bc you were underaged and if you told anyone like CPS they would kick you out. and how would i get a job any way if if fucking too illiterate to write a paragraph and you have social anxiety so bad you cant speak.

&amp;#x200B;

my mom hates me she told me that. she said im not her daughter im just a bitch she gave birth to. shes verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. a fucking drunk, she starts arguments and fights and when i pushed her off of me once my whole family acted like i was the problem. yelling at me claiming i hit her. i wish i fucking could punch her in the face !!! my dad doesn't live with me. he lives in a man camp for his job so i cant live with him.  

&amp;#x200B;

i used to have one friend who was in the same situation as me we were planning on leaving our toxic parents and moving out together. but she moved out bc she had a boyfriend so now she lives with him  and his nice family. i dont talk to her anymore because thats how life goes but lucky her to have a loving support system i have no boyfriend im asexual because i was raped as a child and now cant form intimate relationships and they make me uncomfortable. wow i love childhood trauma making me suicidal today. i told my parents when it happened when i was young seems like they dont care now bc they still bring him up to this day because he lives down the street from our home ( he was a family) i hate them for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have no one because i cut everyone off by isolating myself. most of my friends were in school so when i left i became depressed and stopped talking to people. the moved on with life to have great lives. getting into college, moving out, finding better less boring people to hang with. i see them on social media living it up while im on the verge of suicide everyday. even the people that bullied me in school are living great. parties every weekend happy lives. i wasn't shy when i was in school. i was the type of person to become the shy kids friend. if i saw someone sitting alone i would go sit with them. i was nice to everyone. I was bubbly always making jokes hyper ect. i had big group of friends. so seeing myself depressed and lonely and dull with no emotion makes me feel even more pathetic. i met with an old friend i couple weeks ago and he said i was so different now and ""BORING"" .i thought to me self yeah thats what depression does to you. i havent spoke to him sense bc he hasnt hit me back. guess i really was boring fuck. i try talking to my old friends. we didnt leave off on beef but they just dont reply or they treat me like im someone under them. they probably know i didnt graduate. or they have better lives than me and are busy so thats why im beneath them. i see people from school still friends and close hanging out and loyal but i go through a tuff time in my life and NO ONE COULD STAY BY MY SIDE. im not exaggerating i have literally no one but myself NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY AT 18 YEARS OLD NO ONE BY MYY SIDE SAYING ""YOU CAN DO THIS"" JUST ME AND IM SICK OF ME.

They put their own expectations and goals onto my life and pressured me into doing them that I do not feel as if i control my own life. My own mother told me that if i was white, i would be so much better, after she told me that i never wanted to live again. i can barely smile anymore out in public because i cannot forget those words my parents said to me. Worse of all is that they act as if they never said those words and that i am crazy. I have no one to open my feelings to due to not a single person I know ever wanting to care. I want to die, and I know that nobody will care. I have tried to relay my feelings to my “best” friend, but all he cares about is his own life problems which i listen to 24/7. I am so incredibly antisocial that I am not able to even talk on the internet without be scared. My parents put me into a school where i do not fit in and choose not to listen to me when i ask to go somewhere else that’s more accepting of me. All i want is to make a friend that can listen to me. Somebody who would accept me as myself other than the damn mask i wear every single fucking day. i want to feel any type of emotion other than this overwhelming numbness. i want a parent i could go home to that tells me that they love me rather than comparing me to my other friends and telling me that i am useless. I want a hug from someone who cares. I want to be feel like i belong in this world. Please, someone give me a reason to live.

Just need to say it...,"Was originally a comment on another post, but I really like how it’s written.

 I attempted at 12 (was hospitalized twice in 2 weeks) got sent to a mental hospital for,ironically, 2 weeks. That’s how my parents learned that I hated myself so much I went against the hardwiring of my own brain to purposely harm myself. I can’t give you advice, but I will say this. Being in the ER at ~ 10:00pm and your parents standing over you as you lay there. The tension is so high and the sadness is palpable. It’s more awful than telling them in the comfort of your own home than police entering your house in the middle of the night and waking up your parents just to inform them that their daughter had just made an attempt on her life, and that they she was being taken to the hospital. To make matters worse... I was pretty aware of what was happening and knowing that your parents are following you as you sit there in the ambulance. Would never recommend.

I want to die with my childhood bullies,"I am 19 years old male south korean. I was bullied since first year of elementary school til the last year of high school. Even though in high school i was barely bullied except few cases, i hate bullies in this period the most than other school age. 

The worst memory is middle school age, where people around me had assaulted me physically, verbally, financially and even sexually. For example they hit and kicked face and body, sometimes in pit of the stomach. They made fun of my mom sexually and i cant do anything. They took my money and food. They stole my book. They throw my shoes and bag,cases out of the window and i couldnt find some of them. They even stole school lunch. In sexually, they kicked my balls, squash and scratch my penis, taking my pants off(even underwear too) in front of girls and made fun of me sexually and spread lies about my body and more. They made my mental illness way worse and they now be like nothing happend.

Why i did not fight back is i was too afraid and they are too many.
Some of bullies learned martial arts like boxing and taekwondo or even muay thai so they beat other people more cruelly. I know martial arts should be for weaker people. But in korea, bullies uses their martial arts to beat more people worse. 

Now i am college student but couldnt forgive what they had done to me. So i want to revenge. Sometimes i think what if i chose one(the worst and strongest) of my bullies and kill him and all of his family cause i cant find all of them, then i kill myself too. It is just thought i am having these days and it gives me both thrill and anxiety at the same time.

I need to stay for my kids but it's too much,"I just spent the last few hours googling ways to kill myself and in the end I think I can just buy a few big bottles from the liquor store and down them as fast as I can.

I have three children and I love them so much. But my depression and poor choices probably make it so not being around would benefit them even if they never see it that way. 

I'm in what I think is an emotionally abusive relationship but he keeps convincing me that I am the abuser so maybe I am. He just came into the room, said hateful things, then mocked me crying saying I always have to play the victim but I don't want to play anything. I was to sleep forever and just rest. I'm so scared who will find me and I don't want it to be anyone who loves me by maybe maybe I can do this at night in my car by the police station so a police officer will find me and not a random person who could be a child I just want to be good enough but I think if it's not happened by age 39 it's not going to and sleeping forever is best.",t2_5vpr1ray,6,0
I’ve accepted that it’s too late for me.,"There is no hope for me to recover from my mental illnesses. 

When I was a kid, I thought everything would be okay if I got away from my parents. “Just get away from them, then before you know it, you’ll be yourself again.” used to help me hoard off suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 

But I’m 25 now. Haven’t lived with my parents in years. Hell, don’t even talk to them. Yet it’s the same. I’m still a depressed blob. Still holding onto trauma. 

Fuck near death experiences. They shouldn’t have saved me. They should have left me in the pool. Because now I know what death feels like. I felt death’s kiss for two and a half seconds. I think about those seconds almost every day of my life since then. 20 years later. 

No professional help I’ve received helped and I am done looking for strength inside myself. I’m fed up and I am done. 

I bring joy to people’s lives, but in the same breath bring sadness and burden. They would disagree with me, but I know it in my soul that they’re fed up with seeing and hearing me be depressed. 

What good I am to them? Myself? The world?

"I know on my gut I’m about to go do it, it’s just a matter of when.","*Edit: Title. I typed this post in one go. Less than five minutes. 

I have been in my room since 2019. I haven’t gone out.

For a time last year, I did try to fight. I was very active at my home gym and had a personal trainer come over. But I just can’t pretend anymore. Years before that, I still achieved in my career and worked in spite of what I was going through. 

That was 2017. 

It is now 2020. I have spent day in and day out just thinking about this, rationalising every possible scenario. I have lurked and scrolled Reddit for months on end. I literally spend 24 hours in bed. I shower only once or twice a week. 

I will not go through the trouble of sitting down and talking to someone. No matter who it is, (Therapist, friend or online stranger). It’s like reliving the experience all over again, that hurts. I just will not accept reality anymore. 

I have researched all methods. The quickest and most fool proof way is to jump from my building. I plan fo do it early in the morning so it doesn’t leave much of a mess. It’s a high rise building. 60th floor. 

Thanks for listening. Believe me, I have heard every trick and advice anyone can give because I did make the effort to read hundreds of thousands of comments searching for an answer.

It doesn’t suit my situation. 

Thanks for reading, and I’m happy for you, that any of you has a better life compared to mine. 

Do make it count because there are people like me who have done no wrong and fight like hell but are always dealt with bad cards, would do anything just to have what you have even for a day. 

A type of person who simply does no wrong to other human beings because they know what it feels. 

And the world and its people just keeps being selfish and pushing you. 

I tried praying and I said to whoever that god is, if you’re real take me already because you already know I can’t take it anymore. And you know why. 

He’s not real. I’m still here. 

I’m not meant for world. Plus, I have no one. So it doesn’t really matter what happens to me. At least I tried for so long.",t2_5ufjfuhu,11,0

I do want help but part of my brain is convinced that im faking it and doing it for attention. These kind of thoughts happen whenever i want to fully explain myself to my doctor. Then i tend to end up in a spiral of negative thoughts which ends up with me isolating myself, hurting myself or making preparations for suicide attempts.

I don't know what to do. I feel like i can't get help and i will one day end up killing myself because my brain won't let me be honest. It sounds so stupid but its true. I don't know what to do and every day i feel closer to death",t2_nsc0m,1,0

Guilt of not being there last year of my dogs life,"I've always been with him 24/7. 15 years. Was living at my grandparents place. My family doesn't know how much I spend on my clothes, my grandmother awhile ago had given away a really expensive jacket of mine for free to someone I didn't like in our family. I was extremely pissed. Ended up taking her iPhone 5s to sell to get the money back and pretending I didn't k ow what happened to it. Eventually on the computer she came across my email and the craigslist ad selling it. Needless to say I got kicked out. Only friend I could move in with didn't allow dogs. So I left my dog there thinking I would figure out something to get him up here. I was about an hour away from him. My friend I let borrow my car fraudulently signed the title and stole it. Reporting it to the police did nothing. I couldn't afford to uber or lift. $86 there and back and rent was $600. Was barely making it going says without food sometimes. Ended up not being able to pay rent and moving into someones house.  Right off the bat I asked to bring my dog and they said eventually. So I let it go for awhile, then they asked me to take care of their grandfathers dog for a few weeks. Telling me if I did this for them I could being my dog.... so I did. And felt guilty af taking care if someone elses dog when I hadn't seen mine in so long. Then their two dogs had puppies, so I was afraid to even ask since they were bitching about how many dogs were in the house, and then those puppies since they were shitting and pissing in the kitchen 24/7, the dogs all got leptospirosis. So I didn't bring my dog there at all. Family telling me i should come see my dog soon so I was trying to save the money but $160 was so much and rent was so high I was just trying to save money. I begged my grandparents to let me stay the night with him but they said I couldn't be there that long so I was trying to save the money to bring him and keep him here. By the time I had enough money.... he passed away three days before.

I only saw him one time that year for 5 minutes. My friend had to stop at the police department down there and I went, he waited in the car while i said hi to my dog. He came up, wobbled up to me could barely walk anymore greeted me while.i was trying to pet him but he was more interested in sniffing my hands. Not really excited and yelping for joy like I hoped. Once he got done sniffing my hands he walked away. I figured he was just old and tired and back then I thought it wouldn't be much longer till I came back so I left with my friend again. That was the first time i saw him in like 7 months. 

Through almost a whole year I saw him for only 10 minutes. 

Now that he's dead and I missed my chance I keep thinking of what if he smelled the other dog on me and got sad thinking I found a new one. Or just didn't remember me. Im at the point of suicide because of this and am planning it next week. Going to go to his grave. Already made my will asking for my ashes to be buried there.",t2_30t805hl,2,0

Am i an asshole for wanting to have gotten more support after telling my friend i'm self harming.,"r/AITA doesn't allow any mention of self harm so I'll post it here.

Recently told (via text) my best friend that I trust the most that I've been dealing with self harm. And I expected more support.. or atleast not such cold answers.

A while ago (year?) I realised that I've been having negative thoughts and coping by self harming for years in the form of scratching untill i bled or biting, cutting and pulling my nails and the skin even when it already bled. I thought to myself that because I've been self harming myself for years already, why have I never thought about cutting. I cut myself for the first time and I felt ashamed and dissapointed that I let myself think about this and to let it get this far. After that it was always still on my mind, and I hated it.

My friend had depression and dealt with bad times too, but has never done any kind of self harm, I've always tried to be there for them when they wanted to talk or vent, because I felt the same way even though I never told them. I felt safe and I trusted them about this because I thought they could somewhat understand my feelings or something. This was the first time I ever told anyone about my self harm thoughts. After some awkward texts that i deleted (which they still read through the notifications), I decided to say fuck it and just tell them that I've been thinking about self harm.

After telling me to not be afraid to talk to them and that it's okay to talk about this kind of stuff, they went offline during the conversation, to sleep I guess, without saying bye or anything, while I wanted to finally get the stuff, that I've been holding in for years, off of my chest. I felt abandoned or let down when I felt like I needed them. I cut my self for the second time that night.

Four hours later and it was 5 a.m. and I sent them more stupid messages, basically revealing that I cut myself that night and how it felt. The responses I had when I woke up sounded like I was the problem, that this was my problem and I should deal with it myself, get help, that I'm not the only one who has such thoughts or cuts themselves.

I expected this to be different. I know they aren't obliged to help or listen to me at all, but I just wanted to be heard and this was the first time I ever tried opening up to anyone. Am I an asshole for using them to try to finally open up about myself and/or for wanting it to be more than just this.",t2_42gaevmo,2,0

Just need to vent a bit,"My life isnt that bad, truly, but I'm still unbelievably depressed. I have a loving family, friends, I'm in college, but it still feels like I'm a failure, I find no motivation to do anything. I only am ever proactive when I really force myself and even then they're baby steps. I naturally don't want to talk to anyone, for some reason, and I hate myself for this, the deep down the only thing I want to do is sit around do nothing and smoke weed. And I dont know why, I enjoy going out and doing things but I will never take the first step. It feels like I'm just floating. Like when I leave school I'm just going to get hit hard with real life and fall flat on my face. I find social interactions tolerable but I never really enjoy them. I'm 19 and have yet to have my first girlfriend because for some reason I'm afraid of someone learning that I'm really not worth loving. It just feels like I'm not good enough. I was heavily depressed in middle school and early high school before coming out of it my junior and senior year. My parents think I'm thriving, and I just dont have the heart to tell them the truth. Everyday I find that I'm telling them more and more lies. I see the possibilities in front of me. I know if I really tried I could have a relationship like those around me. I see the clubs and sports and people that try to talk to me and know that I could be this well rounded likable person but It just feels like I dont care enough to get there. I'd really prefer to sit in my dorm all day playing video games, smoking weed, doing homework and sometimes hanging out with people. My interests, although existent feel unimportant. I just dont see a happy future for myself, and thats the scariest thing of all. I want so badly to be someone who can just allow themselves to be happy. But for some reason I can't and so I'll keep circling the drain until I either continue existing in what feels like the shell of a real life, or I fail spectacularly and I just end it. Neither seem optimal for someone who was given as big a head start as I was in life.

Bitch Ftm Is Passivley Suicidal,"I dont really know if i deserve to be on this sub as im not in the worst possible state of mind, so if this isnt like, suicidal enough you can deleet it its ok. 

yeha so like as the title says im ftm.i came out halfway thru 10th grade and i feel like sht. im in grade 11 now. I want to be dead so bad, but im a coward and everytime i only end up failing. people are really good and nice to me,. everyone is pretty excepting, excpet my mom. she pretends to, but when im not around i sometimes here her using wrong pronouns and shit, and ive seen her on 4thwavenow and those kinds of sites. she wont let me get testosterone until im 18, but by that time my bone plates will have fused and itll be no use.  theres two other transguys in my grade and one below me ijust keep thinking: whatre the odds? one of us has to be a faker, theres no trans girls at this schlool. the fact taht all 3 of them pass better rthen me and all follow the typycal trans story doesnt help.

i didnt figue out i was trans until 8th grade, ad because of that i feel like a fraud. all the accounts i read online and the  oter ftm guys at my schoool were always supe r masculine, always say they Hated pink and dolls and stuff, played as boys etc. i didnt i always played a girl in games, did all that girl stuff.. actually was one of the most girly girl. i will never have a male childhood male socialization never ever no matter what i do ill never be a real guy. Ive tried to convince myself im not trans so many times. ill say oh its just a phaze ill grow out of. ill force myself to look at my own naked body for hours, gibing me nightmares. ill force myslef to dress feminine wile my mom and dad are at work. and it makesme want to vomit it really does. before i came out i would spend hours on antitrans sites trying to scare myself out of it- id se e people who testosterone gave them cancer or other conditions, peope who oculdnt live with themselves after transition, people who had convinced them selves they were transgender because of the rampant misogyny in the worlfd. i tried i tried so hard so fucking hard to not come out to not be a freak that no one will ever love. im too short to ever pass i cant pass because of my voise. i activley use female pronouns for myself in my head to demean myself as a form of selfharm. idont want to be alive in a world that hattes trans people so much . i know im disapointing my mom, who raised a girl and tried to hard to show me that women are awesome and good and equal and can do anything that men can. I believe her! i realy do. im confusing my dad, who just wanted a daughter he could raise to believe teh same thing. I wish i was dead. then i wouldnt have to deal with this shit. then i wouldnt have to deal with the fact ill never have a romantic partner. the only girls thatl like me are lesbians wholl pretend to be bi so that they can be with a girl teh only boys thatll like me are straightguys thatll pretend to be bi so that they can be with a girl. i hate myself so much. the terfsll find this post and theyll twist it and use it against the trans communtity and i hate myself for even making something that makes it sound like i doubt myself. i dont doub that im trans. i know i am, i just wish i wasnt. I want to be dead but im a coward. theres a lot more reasone i want to be dead, but i dont want to be identified becuae i put up a lot of personal stuf here. . i wontbe on this account againb ecasue its a threowayaw but ill read the comments if you leave one. youdont' have to thoygh, dont feel obliged. have anice day.",t2_5vou8bxj,5,0

Its partly my fault,"I used to do things and have talents. at least people said so. I used to apparently be a piano wizz. I thought I sucked so i stopped. I dont know if im wrong but i wasnt happy with how i did. Same with drawing. I used to actually be good at drawing but I gave up. and Latin too. I thought I sucked at it. I used to get good marks in school but i've stopped studying or working. I do really badly now the teachers say im smart but I do not believe them. Im really ugly as well noone outside of my mom and her friends have ever complimented my appearance. and people at my school call me ugly a lot. A lot of the time i Cant respond to text messages and then people stop texting me. Things have stopped being enjoyable lately. All i do is play videogames because im bad at everything. I try to break the routine by going on walks but they just seem dull and boring. I sometimes take the bus into town but I just find it all depressing and I see people on drugs and just feel sad.

I dont know what will fix this. a girlfriend wouldnt change anything. I thought it would but It only made me happy for a few days

Midterms are next week and I have to study. I know I wont be able to focus on anything no matter how hard I try. I have an idea. Not a plan but an idea. I keep pushing it off because of this or that. I’m tired of that now. Im going to put on my favorite clothes and do it. Or at least try. I probably wont actually do it because every time I’ve tried, I couldn’t do it. It is what it is. Its so hard because the only person who knows doesn’t want to hear it anymore and frankly, a lot of it is because of him. My family doesn’t know. They never knew.

I lost the love of my life. Now life is pretty much over!,"This is my first post, I’ve read through on here for the past week without creating an account. I thought I was about time, because I’ve seen a lot of similar stories.

I’ve been separated from my wife for the past two month, we have been together for 14 years. (Married for 3). We have 2 amazing children together.

I admit I haven’t been the best husband or dad. I’ve taken them all for granted. I should have realised that I was being an arsehole a lot sooner. I spent too much time working rather than spending time with my beautiful family. Used to come in late from work and just fall asleep and not have time for anyone. My wife and I used to argue about loads of different things, like money and bills. I was a shit person, I made her feel shit unintentionally. I love her with the whole of my heart.

When we separated I had so much time to think about all the shit stuff that I had done. So I made loads of changes, spent less time in the office, started collecting kids from school, taking the kids out for dinner. I’ve lots loads of weight, because I’m working out, I’m paying for PT sessions. I genuinely believe I have changed my whole lifestyle to be a better person. 

Unfortunately this wasn’t enough for her. She doesn’t want me back. She said it’s a little too late. This is killing me so much. All I want is to hug her again. She is the love of my life. I miss her so much! I just want to be able to treat her like she should be treated. I’ve realised now what i should have been doing. She’s not having any of it. 

Now I have major regret. I’m in a dark place. I feel worthless. I’ve been to the doctor, they said that I have severe depression. It’s a big dark hole that I feel like I cannot get out of. I can’t function properly day to day. She told me to tell the kids it’s all my fault, she said the kids are not bothered wether I’m not there, they don’t ask for me etc. 

The kids are the only positive thing I have let in my life.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Will it ever get better? I feel like I don’t need to be around anymore. 

I feel like there’s nothing left for me now. Constant memories are making me feel shit all day everyday. I think that now she might be seeing someone else. So that means there would be no way for me to go back to the only love of my life. 

I think it would be best for all that I no longer be around.",t2_5vpmriwy,3,0

"A suicide attempt, i guess","I feel so miserable. I was just going to self harm slightly, to feel better. I ended up taking my belt, hanging it on the door and trying to sit down.

I’m such a fucking pussy. I don’t know what to do now. I guess keep acting like everything is alright. Tough but alright. How do I explain why i sent my ex a text saying i love him with no context?

"Suicidal Thoughts, But not suicidal.","Im 17 and for the past few weeks I've been having dreams and thoughts of suicide and I don't know what to do. The dreams are very vivid, and so are the thoughts.  I don't want to die, to commit suicide, to do any of that stuff, but it never goes away. 
I cut myself twice along my arms and I didn't want to- I just felt as if I wasnt there and watched myself do it. I wasn't focusing on it, I wasn't thinking about it. It was an idea in my head that I pushed away but I did it anyway.
I'm scared that the way I acted when I cut myself could happen for suicide, I have 3 earphones tied up in my room and I've made sure they can hold my weight. I don't even know why I made sure, or why the thought that I could hang myself with them has already gone so far.
Every night I look at my desk at where the earphones are and I shake, too scared to go near them. I don't want to touch them incase I do something. I'm constantly worried about it. I've seen in my dreams me stabbing myself, hanging myself, shooting myself, jumping off a cliff, ect. They started when I cut myself, but when I stopped they didn't. Then they started to become common thoughts that would be stuck in my head for hours, that would make me too scared to do anything just because I knew how easy it would be.
I don't want to die. I really don't. I just don't want to do it without thinking.",t2_1y3io5n7,2,0
A sad reality.,"Hey, my name is I'll leave this blank for now.
So I've been facing many problems in life. When the truth is told to you a person who you see as a friend , perhaps your only friend or hurts a lot , so much that there's no point in trying to fix it. That's the situation I'm in. I've decided to share all my problems from today on this account. Probably no one will read this for quite some time. But that's alright. It's just a mode for me me to share my feelings. Just a guy and his lonley self. I have no best friend , I have no love of my life. I just have 'me' , and I'm the lonliest man out here. Things are hard right now. My only friend , she's kinda cool probably told me to my face that I needed help and I can't rely on her any more. But the truth is she's the only one who can help me, she's the only one who comes close to understanding me. No one else does or ever did.

I can’t live like this,"I feel so useless. I can’t do anything right. I’m shy, antisocial and a loner. I’ve been depressed for several years now and it’s just getting worse and worse. 

I want to kill myself so badly, but I can’t bring myself to do it; not because I care about my life, but because it will devastate my parents. All other people that know/knew me will eventually recover from my suicide and continue with their lives as normal, but not my parents. 

I’m an only child. They dedicated their lives to me, they are paying for me to study what and where I wanted. They will never recover from my sucide and their lives will be over.

But I can’t live like this anymore. Every single day I wake up and regret waking up, regret that I didn’t magically die in my sleep. I try not to show how I feel, and I think I’m doing a good job - no one suspects that I’m suicidal. 

I have the means to do it right now. If I do it right, it will work. If it doesn’t, I can try again. But the thought of doing this to my parents, completely shattering their lives is making it very difficult.

Opening up about my life to the whole world,"i’m not feeling good at all. i want to die. but for some reason i felt like opening up. i’m sorry for taking your time. don’t feel the need to read, i’m just wasting your precious time 🙏🏻

people have too high expectations of me. i’m not allowed to make any mistakes or i’m seen as a worthless, a good for nothing child. i try my best, i really do. but it’s not easy. i just wish i could just be myself without any pressure. 

i am abused physically and mentally. i don’t really care if i get hurt by hitting or anything anymore, i feel like i deserve it. i don’t really mind the verbal abuse either, but it tends to make me think why i have to be so useless. imagine this. 4 is the worst grade you can get and 10 is the best. you get 9 1/2 from it and barely missed the 10 because of a little mistake you made. ”you are so fucking worthless.” ”you have to study.” ”why do you have to be like your big brother?” it’s not the greatest feeling you get from it. i don’t really mind myself being dissed, but the fact that people even dare to mention my perfect, best and most caring brother like that, i get so angry. i can’t even say anything back or they’ll hurt me. 

i’m scared of people. i start panicking when i’m around people and my chest just starts to hurt. i feel like i can’t breathe well. i think my fear of people might have started when i was picked up by a random man as a younger kid. 

i’m scared of doctors. i know that they’re supposed to help you and all, but i can’t help it. maybe it’s because my grandpa almost died in their hands only because of their little mistake, i don’t know. but my grandpa has been the closest person to me for as long as i can remember. 

i lost my close friend to cancer a few years back. at that time, i tried to kill myself for the first time. i felt so done with everything. guess who didn’t accomplish her goal? i still hate myself to this day for not doing it.

i had to put one of my animals down a few months later. i was NOT feeling any better and my thoughts were still there with me. the loss of my animal made me feel even worse because i kept blaming myself for something i could have never helped with. there went my 2nd attempt. still here.

the last two years after that have just been me constantly fighting back for no reason at all. i don’t know what keeps holding me back even though i don’t really have anything left. countless attempts and i’m still here.

i just want to go, really. why must i be somewhere where i don’t want to be? i can’t freely be myself or without pain. i just wish i could die peacefully and not live with the pain that just keeps increasing. it’s getting harder and harder. at the same time, the urge and the need to go is growing rapidly. just let me go, please.",t2_5skvqxy8,2,0

public/altruistic suicide fantasy,"might delete this later depending on reception

i know this is probably a really shitty mindset to have but i really don't give a fuck, this is how i feel and i'm fucking tired of censoring myself for other people

i don't think that society as a whole really realizes what suicide is like and how serious it really is. i wish i could just use my pain to help benefit the other mentally ill kids like me and show everyone what it's really like.

i don't want to physically hurt other people, because that's just sending a message that mentally ill people are evil. if i was fucking stupid, i'd go and hurt others. but that wouldn't further my cause.

sometimes when i feel like complete and utter garbage i fantasize about going on TV or in front of a government building or somewhere very public where potentially influential people could see me, and briefly explaining my situation and how it relates to all the other depressed kids out there, and then blowing my brains out for as many people as possible to see in full, graphic detail.

then two things would be accomplished– a.) i can stop wasting resources that a better person probably deserves to use more than me, and b.) people might actually realize that suicide is a real, terrible thing, and that it happens every day, probably every few seconds.

i don't care if it traumatizes them. in fact, as sick as it sounds, i want it to. i want them to feel the pain that i feel due to living in a society that, for the most part, doesn't give two shits about mentally ill people. (insert joker meme here)

i want the people who saw it to lay awake in bed at night, unable to stop replaying it in their heads, thinking about how many other people this has happened to. every fucking day, suicides happen, and society doesn't give a single fuck, save for a few truly kind souls. i want it to fucking hurt. i want them to know how much it hurts.

that way, since i obviously can't accomplish anything with my life, i could at least accomplish something with my death.

maybe if there was enough publicity around it, it would actually move people to give a shit, preferably lawmakers (hence government buildings) so that some more provisions could be given to kids like me who struggle through what most people feel are the easiest things out there.

but you know what would be funny? if things stayed the same and nobody gave a shit anyways.

i once read an article about public suicide and about a newswoman who shot herself in the head on live television. that really fucking moved me and i respect the amount of courage that took. it's hard for me to talk about my mental state to my closest friend, let alone thousands of people.

please note that this is not a suicide PLAN. this is not something i'm actually planning on doing anytime soon. altruistic suicide is just some stupid fantasy of mine. i'm just a dumb edgy fuck.

I am Autistic and kind of at the end of my rope mentally.,"I was diagnosed at five years old, currently twenty four, and my life hasn't at all been an easy one. I live in the United States and there just wasn't a lot going on for autism awareness or how to handle kids with autism when I was growing up. On top of it all I grew with two sets of parents (mom and dad divorced) and it was absolutely poisonous. My mom and dad are both narcissists, they were constantly violent and dysfunctional with each other while they were together and dragged me into their screwed up issues and lives on top of me inheriting a disorder that neither of them have.   


I've been abused, insulted, neglected, had resentments held against me by my own mother, been bullied by people for being the weird kid who always cried in class, had meltdowns that would leave me screaming and crying, had to be put in special ed for a while, and spent the majority of my time friendless and alone just playing the same games, watching the same shows, and walking back and forth in my room for hours and hours a day. All at the same time the verbal and emotional abuse was endless, I was triggering Narcissists with no real self awareness and constantly consumed by rage.  


There appears to be a human element missing, something I don't have that I can't get, something I don't have that I'll never know I'm missing. I don't have the resolve, I don't have the will, I almost take pleasure in failing because it's all I seem capable of. I get tired easily, I can only focus on useless things, I dream of having a regular, peaceful life but the cognitive capacity eludes me. I keep inventing reasons to live, but my suffering causes me to to want to die. This existence is pointless, agonizing, and I only live for my own pleasure at the mercy of my survival instincts and only hoping my love of my closest loved ones can help me stay alive for a while longer.   


There's too much to say really, I don't think anyone has the time to read a book about my pain, this post might already be too long, but I just feel like typing because I'm hurting. I've been trying to get into a group home/mental institution because there are too many issues and I have no idea how to handle it. OCD, Anxiety, Major Depression Disorder, Sleep Issues, Attention Issues, Sensory Problems, weak family support, living in poverty, a desire to die but a conflicting hope for improvement. I feel my health is too far gone to have a real future, but I'm too cowardly to willingly bring about my death, but too scared to face more agony and even more afraid to put my pain on loved ones.   


I've been borderline homeless for a while, too ill to take care of myself but also too ill to handle the dysfunctions of those who have power over me. The mental health system hasn't been much help either, I simply need to find a group home and have myself squared away. I'm too tired to live, too scared to die, hopeful for a life I may never be capable of sustaining, terrified of an uncertain future on a planet falling into chaos and a country with a broken political system and weak safety nets. I don't want to commit suicide, I don't want to die, but nature hasn't endowed me with the circumstances to live upright, therefore I don't know if it is more reasonable to seek the end of my agony, I simply don't know.   


Thanks for reading TLDR: Autistic with a long history of abuse and physically unwell, can't see much of a way forward unless I can get myself into a program to take care of my basic needs.",t2_16ammv,1,0
I had a really dark thought that I can’t forget about,"i don’t know what made me think of it, but last night when i was laying in bed trying to sleep I had some sort of day dream that was more like a nightmare

 I saw my body on the floor after I had committed suicide in my dorm room

then I could hear someone who worked at my university on the phone with my mom saying

 “Hi is this (x name’s) mother? i’m calling to inform you that she was just found dead in her room” 

it made me imagine the way my mom would truly feel and it made me so upset. i’ve had suicidal thoughts for the last few years and i’ve even attempted once, but something about how vivid this scene played out in my head just gave me chills. 

please take care of yourselves, suicide is never an option",t2_3lbmn7pi,1,0
I'm just gonna hang myself,"I'm not looking to be talked out, this is just my note. I have tried to kill myself 4 times before, but all of those time I had something to live for. Not anymore. Up until recently I thought I had good friends, but it turns out they actually don't really care about me that much, hell they even throw parties without even thinking about me. I left the groupchat and no one said anything. I've been hanging out by myself everyday since then and they haven't noticed. My ""best friends"" go out by themselves without saying anything to me. My family barely acknowledges my existence and I really just want everything to stop. My pills don't even have an effect anymore. I'll just hang myself for old times sake.",t2_16ovlclc,19,0
Young soul,"Have you ever loved someone, and lost that one? Days spent curled up in your own psyche full of worries and woes. Covered with the mistakes of your past, emotions bottled up and tucked within the shadows of your heart. These bottles of emotions eventually floating to the surface of your heart, choking you up and making it hard to want to exist. You’ve lost your sense of purpose, living in an empty shell of who you used to be. Attempting to laugh and smile, carrying on with normal life. Young soul, 21 years old. Feeling like you’ve been on this earth for more than your existence, but feeling like you’re running out of time all the same. A pendulum of anxiety ticking away, each click introducing another wave of hopelessness and helplessness. You have friends and family who are more than happy with hearing your heart, but you’re too afraid to confide in them. They have their own issues, so you shouldn’t bother them with yours. Only feeling comfortable with confiding in strangers who do not know you. Afraid to reach out for help. Afraid to admit you need help. Too many suicide attempts to count. All failed, because of you and your second guessing. But what if I do have more to look forward to? Why do I feel like I’m running out of time? I don’t think I will make it past 25. These thoughts follow you. Too afraid to drive. Too afraid to do that walk you’ve been wanting to do because you’re afraid you might get killed. These worries follow you, brushing across your thoughts when you least expect it. Countless panic attacks and feelings of dread. Hopeless. Helpless. Two words that seem to never let you be. You want help. You need help. You feel as if you’re trapped within yourself. You know this isn’t the person you used to be. What changed you?

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to stop shouldering other people’s issues and tackle my own. I live through other people’s happiness, but where is mine? I’m always angry, irritated. I hurt those that mean a lot to me. I love with regrets.  Lately I have been thinking about suicide more and more. I have had these thoughts for a little over 10 years now with little to no help.

"12 years of abuse, by 5 different men","Nothing is distracting me from my thoughts. I’ve been physically and mentally abused for 12 years with 5 different men. The relationship with the last guy just ended 3 days ago and the journey to self love is only getting worse for me, the day after I was upset but could distract myself, I knew it was the right thing. it’s day 3 and i can’t cope at all with anything that’s happening whatsoever. I can’t distract myself anymore. My brain is on over load. I can’t do drugs to numb myself because I have none and I have no money. I can’t drive my car to calm down because I have no money for gas. I have no money because of the abusive ex was an alcoholic and sucked me dry. I lost my self worth with him again like I did with all the other men, but I think it mainly started with the very first one, when I was 13. I’m 24 now. I thought since this keeps happening it must be my fault, so I unblocked and reached out to every ex since a lot of time has passed and asked them from what they can remember- what was wrong with me, why did they do the things they did , what did I do to push them so far, to just be as honest as possible and tell me everything that was actually wrong with me that caused the relationship to end up being the way it was. they all responded the same- telling me none of it was ever my fault, they all had demons and I was such a nice loving forgiving person they were able to let all their demons out on me and I stayed and tried to work with them, which only enabled them more and eventually they cheated. and that’s what caused me to leave them, the cheating. Not the abuse. Since I’ve been dealing with it so long I’m so used to it now, and I find love in it. I love my abuser, I love my ex, I want to die and I rather die from his abuse than killing myself. How many fucking years of therapy would it take to set my brain straight again? Probably till I’m 80 years old. This started when I was fucking 13/14. The first guy trained me that this is what I deserve, and I would be forced to do his drugs because if I didn’t he would do them all and overdose, he would hit me with his drum sticks, he would choke me and say horrible shit to me. One time his friends were around and he did it, I just allowed it and they tried breaking it up, but I didn’t want to leave. I loved my abusers when I was with them and I don’t know what to do about it. This all has been extremely stressful, so stressful that at 30 years old I’m expected to be completely bald, I have been loosing massive amounts of hair because of this stress going on for so long, I’ve been going to doctors for it the past few months and started taking pills to get the hair growth back/hair-loss less, but it doesn’t even fucking matter because what the fuck is life dude.",t2_5c4fz05o,1,0

Just wanted to say,"I'm 14. The perfect girl.
That's what I was. 

One day, I moved. To another country, another continent.
I was happy. I never thought I could one day be so depressed. Life was good to me as a 10 year old girl.

The school started.
My Innocence finally died completely. I was submitted to almost every single form of torture.

Everyday I was remembered that no one loved me. My parents expectations of me were surreal. I had no friends and became a prisoner of my own feelings and a slave to those people in school that told me I wasn't going to make more friends other than them, because I was a terrible person.

Ugly.
Immature.
Innocent.
Every single offense existent. I was all of that.

I changed schools. Again. I was alone. Again.

Never found friends.
Kept getting remembered that I don't deserve love.
I never did.

Sometimes someone decided to try to be my friend. I always made them go away. Because I am who I am.
I hurted people that I cared about. 

One day a guy decided to try too. He never stopped loving me. But I don't deserve him. And he should notice this soon too. I can't make him go away, even though I know I'm hurting him too.
He has depression. And I am useless to him. He have to find someone else. I care so much for him and want him to be happy, without me.

I don't even know why I'm writing this. All of this must be a mess right now. I'm not thinking, just writing, I need to say something before I go crazy.

I'm not going to kill myself, I just can't. But I really really wanted to be dead. To stop existing. It's so tiring and feeling like I can never be happy just... Makes even more sad. 
Maybe one day I'll be better. I don't know. I won't stop believing this.

I can't do this anymore,"I'm so sorry for the huge rant, but I feel like it's time to get this off my chest and talk to someone who really cares. TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been really suicidal for three years now. At first, it was on and off, the thoughts were really distressing but I could shove them away and focus on whatever else I had to get done. Of course, that didn't work for long, and about a year ago I started feeling intense urges to end my life. I couldn't focus on anything because my brain always came back to how I would kill myself.

Fast-forward to October of 2018. My world felt like it was falling apart; I had just discovered my sexuality (I am gay), people around me were making crude comments and inappropriate advances, such as touching, and I was generally so fed up with life. I remember reaching out to a teacher, who initially was very supportive. I was so happy to feel like someone understood me, but that all changed very quickly, as she told other teachers and the school counsellor. I lost all trust in my teachers, but a part of me chose to believe in the counsellor. I guess I believed she could have helped me.

I spent the next month largely in her small office, talking endlessly about the mistreatment from classmates and feelings I had bottled up. After talking to the students who were causing the biggest issues, she started entertaining the idea of telling my parents. I had gone to great lengths to hide everything from my parents, as I knew they would not understand the situation at all. We went back and forth for two months, which ended in her telling my parents secretly and despite my pleading not to.

When I got home that day, my parents immediately took me to my room and began to almost interrogate me. Was I really feeling this way? If so, why did I reach out to someone else first? Fearing my relationship with them would tank, I denied everything for the next two weeks. Around this time, we had an annual checkup coming up, and so I decided to wait until the checkup to discuss it further. I downloaded a mood tracker on my phone (Moodpath, I think) and completed the assessment in those two weeks.

Around this time, my parents became very religious and, fresh off healing cancer, wanted me to try some of their ""remedies."" The first time, I was told I didn't believe and God didn't accept my prayer because of it. So the second and third times, I believed. I put all my faith into being cured by God, but for some reason he never came through. This only left me feeling worse, and my parents continually accused me of lacking faith, and this was punishment for it.

Before we left for the appointment, my mom asked again if I actually felt helpless, down, anxious, and so on. I caved, and told her a little bit more about what had been happening. She nodded, told my dad and we drove to the appointment in silence. When I was called in, I asked if my parents could take a seat outside while I talked to the doctor, and he reluctantly agreed. I explained to the doctor everything I had been feeling, the inability to work, and showed him the mood assessment, as well. He read it over, nodded, and said he'd talk to my parents.

About ten minutes later, I'm called back in. He said he would refer me to a psychiatrist, but he also began an awkward, prying line of questioning. He said I was generally attractive, had decent grades and a good family life, and so I had no real reason to be depressed. I was angry, to say the least, and we left it at that. When we walked out the door, my parents mentioned the doctor saying there was ""no actual problem"", and all I needed was to spend more time with my parents.

Slowly but surely, things started ""getting better."" By April, I felt like life was manageable and I could work on long-term recovery. By June, I was vivacious and almost bouncing with happiness. I had restarted so many projects I previously ditched, and my work ethic soared. Friends said I was almost wired, but I brushed their concerns off entirely.

December came, and I was hit again. This time, it felt like I was hit by a truck, but pinned down underneath the back wheel; the sadness was crushing, mounting and it prevented me from functioning. In class, I took up all the work I could, but spent my nights crying in bed, pacing around impatiently trying to get the work done before it was due the next day. It was around this time I noticed a huge change in my thinking, as well; I have had odd and violent intrusive thoughts since as long as I can remember, but they were not as severe. When I was younger, I would associate certain words with pictures in my head, and anytime the word was said, the mental image came along with it. Around this time, the images shifted greatly, going from benign and often amusing to horrifying images of violence, often involving people I loved. This drove me nearly insane, and I knew I had to tell someone.

I remember sitting my mom down the day after Christmas, and before I got a single word out it was like a dam broke. I was trying my best to explain what I was going through, but my she kept pressuring me to say more and explain everything. For some reason, this really put me off telling her more, and cut it off early. She insisted she was taking this very seriously, and we would find someone to start treatment immediately.

About a week later, when I ask what the situation is looking like, I am told we can't find anyone right now and it might be a long time before we get in touch with someone who can help. Having done extensive research myself, I inform them about programs available at local hospitals, but they shrugged it off and told me to just wait. The more I insisted, the more agitated they became, and started to make up lies to put me off seeking treatment.

In January, we finally get to a psychiatrist. He seemed very concerned, and wanted me to come in immediately. I was given an appointment for about two weeks from the call, and things were definitely looking up. My parents continued to gaslight me, insisting I was making up the majority of my symptoms and to stop being so dramatic. The morning of the appointment, they said although I was completely fabricating my whole situation, they still were taking me to see a doctor because they loved me. In the waiting room, I was told by them to not explain the extent of my symptoms, and to even not discuss a few entirely.

To make an already long story a little shorter, I was diagnosed with severe OCD that afternoon. I was given a link, another appointment in two weeks, and the task of explaining to my parents what OCD was. Originally, they took it very well, and almost seemed understanding. We went back two weeks later, and we discussed medication. I was put on an SSRI, and given another appointment in two weeks.

Around this time, my friends described the same ""wired"" behaviour as I had experienced the past summer. I also noticed restless and irritable behaviour, which resulted in a number of people asking me if I was okay. My ability to focus literally vanished, and I was also quite euphoric, but dismissed it. When I saw the psychiatrist again, he mentioned I seemed very happy and energetic, but I just said I was having a good day. He reluctantly ramped up my dose and told me to call if it worsens.

A few days after the appointment, my sleep quality tanked. I was sleeping two hours a night, and waking up feeling like I was on crack cocaine. I begged my parents to call the psychiatrist, and it took an hour for them to relent. He was very concerned and told me to come in immediately. I was diagnosed with bipolar II and instructed to stop my medication immediately.

When my parents heard me describing my symptoms to the psychiatrist, they seemed livid. I was apparently trusting someone else more than them, and they needed someone to blame. Of course, what better target than my phone? It was the only logical explanation, in their minds, for the inability to sleep, euphoria, and goal-driven behaviour. Right after the appointment, they told me my phone would be taken every night at 7pm, and only returned to me at 7am.

When I went to the psychiatrist last week, he seemed fed up with seeing me. I asked him what our next steps were, and he said his hands were tied; my parents refused to ""medicate"" me until therapy was at least tried, and so he referred me to a psychologist who could do that. I'm still stuck here, with no appointment as of yet.

I have spent the last year talking to a local helpline basically every day, but it doesn't help anymore. Messages don't go through until they inform me they are ending the chat because I won't respond. I have to wait an hour from the time I text them to when I see a response. My friends have also been very unsupportive, oftentimes laughing at my diagnoses and making it a point to yell one out at random times. Other friends will tell me they're busy before I get a chance to tell them I'm struggling.

My parents have gone basically insane at this point. They now give me water with food colouring mixed in, supposedly to heal me. I also must wear a band on my arm at all times, except for showering. I am constantly gaslit, told I can't have a ""cleaning disease"" when my room is a mess, or when my marks are slipping.

I fear I won't make it longer than two weeks. I've started writing my suicide notes to the people I love and hate, and I'm looking into what to overdose on before I hang myself. I don't want to hurt anyone, but this is too much to handle. I can't take this anymore.

Thank you for whoever read through this tedious rant, it means the world to me and I can never thank you enough. Maybe I'll mention this in my suicide note, so they can see what it's like.

The Soothing Thought of Suicide,"Last night I had trouble sleeping. There was a flush of negative thoughts berating my mind. I couldn't help but to think that I'll live my whole life alone. I couldn't stop myself from thinking that I don't have any one who cares about me. I wasn't strong enough to fight these feelings. I feel alone. I feel like I have no friends. My family is so far away. I try so hard to fight the thoughts and tell myself that I can fight off the feeling, that I can learn to love myself and it will be enough.

Last night I have reached my limit. I can't fight it off anymore. I need help. I am coming here for emotional support. I'm afraid and I don't know what to do with my life. I am soon to graduate university with a loss of where to go because I have no one to follow. I have no friends and family to go to after I graduate. 

The only thing that could let me sleep is the thought of death. I told myself that I didn't have to put up with this for much longer. The only thing that could sooth me to sleep was the thought of suicide.

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some day soon I will take my life. This is what gave me the relief I needed to sleep. 

This scares me. I am scared that this relief is what will push me over the edge. I am afraid, and I need help, but I don't know how to ask for it.",t2_5vnsriyz,6,0

**the sections:**

* Her situation/depression
* My final decision

# the relationship

My girlfriend (18) and I (18) started dating 2 years ago at 16 back in high school. We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

We used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.

In high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.

Everything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).

# Her situation/depression

My girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.

After hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.

She always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.

She eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.

Everything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.

I thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.

# My final decision

I still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.

I really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.

I know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.",t2_5vn91nzw,3,0

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement).

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",t2_1t70,1730,0
Reminder: Absolutely no activism of any kind is allowed here. Any day.,"If you want to recognise an occasion, please do so by offering extra support to those who've asked for it, and by being a good citizen of the community, mindful of our tips and guidelines.

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair.",t2_1t70,1215,0
Haha help,"Yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I am ""getting help"". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever.",t2_u5zigd9,161,0

I am a horrible abusive person who undeniably deserved to die.,"I'm going to get straight to the point. When I become particularly mad, I sometimes become violent. Since I was about 12-18 years old, I took this violence out on my brother. He is 8 years younger than me.

When he did things that made me mad I'd become violent with him and verbally abuse him. I hit him, pushed him to the floor, pinched him, whatever. Sometimes I made him bleed slightly. One time he went to school with a bruise on his neck and the school called a cop to our house. My punishment was hardly even a slap on the wrist, all that happened is the cop told me not to do it again. This was only a few months ago. I'm 19 now.

I can't stop thinking about the things I've done to my brother and the fact that I've probably traumatized him for life. The fact that he clearly has anxiety, the fact that he says he wants to kill himself when he gets mad, the fact that he kept skipping school for the longest time, all of that is my fault. I have undeniably ruined his life and I cannot live with that fact on my shoulders every day of my life. It haunts me every night. 

When someone brings up being abused in their life, all I can think of is myself. I am an abuser. I abused a *child*. This isn't just ""sibling rivalry"". There is an 8 year difference between us. I abused him when I was 18. Legally an adult. There's no excuses. 

I think that I am on the same level as a rapist. I've violated him, just in a different way. I've likely given him self esteem issues for the rest of his life. I will never be forgiven and I shouldn't be. What I did was inexcusable and the only way my brother can ever face some semblance of justice is for me to die. I can't continue living knowing what I've done to him. 

A simple apology will not cut it. I'm sure many people have received apologies from their abusers but that didn't make it better. No one ever forgives their abusers. I deserve to die. I deserve to die in an incredibly painful way. I do not come here expecting sympathy and any reason people give me to not kill myself is invalid. If you think I should live, you are validating an abuser. I need to die. I expect most people to agree. A good person would agree.",t2_5wgahit1,41,0

I live with my mum and my siblings yet every waking moment all I feel is pain and loneliness, I cannot walk into the kitchen at night or when I'm alone without the thought of just cutting myself overwhelming me. 

The past week have been riddled with suicidal thoughts and just 5 minutes before I wrote this I had a bad desire to just slit my own throat. I want help but I physically cannot talk to people due to my anxiety and my mother won't let me take medication. I'm begging for help at this point and no one is listening to me. Someone please help me",t2_uvjdp79,9,0
I just want to rest.,"I have a beautiful girlfriend, I finally moved out of my homophobic and abusive family house (Im from africa so I have been beaten since I was a kid) and I found a job that pays fairly well, I have 10 weeks left of school and Im done for good. This all seems fantastic but Im so fucking unhappy with myself. I have been crying for the past 4 days because of how much I hate myself and I dont want to be here anymore. The voices keep telling me Im so unworthy of love and worthless. I cant find any worth within myself. I havent been able to for the past 19 years, I dont think I ever will. I just want to rest and not be in pain. Not hurt myself or others. And yes i have been suicidal for several years now so there isnt an argument I havent heard of",t2_15s36q,1,0

wait with me,"i'm currently getting through a month-long bout of one of my worst despressive episodes yet. Broke my two-year long abstinence from self harm. Things are rough.
But I want to share what little hop I've got with you guys. Comment below and I'll give you company. I won't preach about how you have so much to live for/you'll be missed/etc, becaude everyone here has heard it all before, but I will talk with you. And I'll wait for better days with you.
Sometimes the only thing that makes me feel better is sitting and talking with no fear of judgement. So I invite you guys to wait with me.",t2_42j8iug9,4,0
Is almost jumping off a building a suicide attempt?,"The title says it all. I don't want to go into details, but I just want to know.",t2_5rdu7b8c,3,0
I'm tired.,I don't know what to do.  I have no one.  I'm a high school dropout.  I'm so lonely and I just don't want to live like this anymore.,t2_4nxz31nb,4,0
I wish I was never born.,"   I want to kill myself. I can't bring myself to tell anyone, I promised my dad I wouldn't. I have chronic depression and severe anxiety and I'm too scared to ask anyone for help. I'm too pathetic to kill myself anyways. 

   Im a failure to my family and anyone who's helped me. I don't know how to ask for help. Everyday I have the chance to help myself, get back into school but I stay home because I'm too pathetic and selfish to see that people are wanting to help me. I've wasted many years of their life. I want it to end but I know they'd think it was their fault. I'd only ruin their life more. 

   I've written so many journals full of things I can't tell people. When I don't tell them, I feel so alone, they seem like strangers. Im losing my friends because I just can't express emotions. I feel like an empty husk.

   How do I tell these people that care about me and worked so hard to help me that it isn't working. My father's about to give up on me. My parents almost split because of me. My dad always blames himself for my problems. I don't want him to suffer anymore.

   My life doesn't feel like mine anymore. It's just an endless movie.",t2_2c27arp7,4,0
"Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends.","I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...

I just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breathe and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.",t2_4cfx78jz,8,0
