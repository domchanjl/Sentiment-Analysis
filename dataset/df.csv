"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",t2_1t70,1728,0,0,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever.",t2_u5zigd9,158,0,0,"Haha help Yes, I am suicidal.

I am a horrible abusive person who undeniably deserved to die.,"I'm going to get straight to the point. When I become particularly mad, I sometimes become violent. Since I was about 12-18 years old, I took this violence out on my brother. He is 8 years younger than me.

When he did things that made me mad I'd become violent with him and verbally abuse him. I hit him, pushed him to the floor, pinched him, whatever. Sometimes I made him bleed slightly. One time he went to school with a bruise on his neck and the school called a cop to our house. My punishment was hardly even a slap on the wrist, all that happened is the cop told me not to do it again. This was only a few months ago. I'm 19 now.

I can't stop thinking about the things I've done to my brother and the fact that I've probably traumatized him for life. The fact that he clearly has anxiety, the fact that he says he wants to kill himself when he gets mad, the fact that he kept skipping school for the longest time, all of that is my fault. I have undeniably ruined his life and I cannot live with that fact on my shoulders every day of my life. It haunts me every night. 

When someone brings up being abused in their life, all I can think of is myself. I am an abuser. I abused a *child*. This isn't just ""sibling rivalry"". There is an 8 year difference between us. I abused him when I was 18. Legally an adult. There's no excuses. 

I think that I am on the same level as a rapist. I've violated him, just in a different way. I've likely given him self esteem issues for the rest of his life. I will never be forgiven and I shouldn't be. What I did was inexcusable and the only way my brother can ever face some semblance of justice is for me to die. I can't continue living knowing what I've done to him. 

A simple apology will not cut it. I'm sure many people have received apologies from their abusers but that didn't make it better. No one ever forgives their abusers. I deserve to die. I deserve to die in an incredibly painful way. I do not come here expecting sympathy and any reason people give me to not kill myself is invalid. If you think I should live, you are validating an abuser. I need to die. I expect most people to agree.

Suicidal Ideation,"I’ve been on Prozac, Lexapro, Abilify, and Lorazepam. I’ve been in therapy for a year. I try so hard to find interest in things, I force myself to leave the house, nothing is working. I really need some advice from people who’ve come out of some really dark depressive episodes.

I wish I was never born.,"   I want to kill myself. I can't bring myself to tell anyone, I promised my dad I wouldn't. I have chronic depression and severe anxiety and I'm too scared to ask anyone for help. I'm too pathetic to kill myself anyways.

I want it to end but I know they'd think it was their fault. I'd only ruin their life more. 

   I've written so many journals full of things I can't tell people. When I don't tell them, I feel so alone, they seem like strangers. Im losing my friends because I just can't express emotions. I feel like an empty husk.

   How do I tell these people that care about me and worked so hard to help me that it isn't working. My father's about to give up on me. My parents almost split because of me. My dad always blames himself for my problems. I don't want him to suffer anymore.

"Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends.","I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...

I just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Can't really say I'm sad or depressed but being so fucking drained and exhausted every single day makes me want to die already,"Im 17 and currently at middle school, specifically grade 10. Lately my daily activities are just so repetitively boring and exhausting. I wake up, take a bath, eat breakfast, attend class, eat lunch, attend class, sleep until dinner time, eat dinner, complete homeworks and other school requirements, sleep. I rarely find time to entertain myself and if ever I do, I sleep or play mobile/computer games but I can't enjoy playing as much as I did before. Sometimes, when there are no school works for the night, I always think to myself why I am just playing and not doing a school work, even if there is absolutely no school work to do. The workload that the school is giving  really feels unreasonable. Whenever I'm doing a school work, I always wish that I can skip to having a family and a stable job and skip these fucking integrals and dipshit shakespeare. But then it's impossible to skip it so I have experience at least five more years of agony. I wanted to consider having to leave school for a year or even completely stop going to school but it's a big no no because of my family's expectations. And if ever I explain my situation to them, they will probably just dismiss it and force me to finish school. So now the option I'm thinking of is to end everything by killing myself. No happiness but at least there's also no mo more agony.

God I'm so pathetic that whenever I hear about someone dying the only thing I feel is jealousy. No amount of medicine or therapy will ever fix me, it's always one more obstacle after the other and for what, to waste away by myself still having no friends and being regarded as an awkward creep forever.

Why the hell is it so hard to kill yourself? I would legitimately offer someone my life savings if they could guarantee a way to kill me painlessly or instantly but it's just a pipe dream. I'm going to fucking do it for real one of these days. I constantly feel like a ticking bomb.

I held a gun to my head,"Last week my girlfriend left me. I made a horrible mistake and hurt her. She left the house and stayed with her brother while she needed time to think. A few days ago I sat on my bed after breaking down and grabbed my pistol. I pressed it against my head as hard as I could for a minute and didn’t feel anything. Maybe it was because it wasn’t loaded? So I cocked it and held it there again with my finger on the trigger. Still, I felt nothing. No emotions or sadness. I wasn’t even afraid either.

Instead, I waited to see if I had a chance to get the love of my life back. While she was away, she told me things such as “I’m not giving up on you” and “I love you”. I really thought we were going to make it through this. Today, she ended it for good and moved all of her belongings out of my house while I was at work.

Everytime i take the train i think about killing myself.,"Hi, I'm a 15y/o student, not a native speaker and using Google Translator, so maybe this text can be confusing.


Going straight to the point, I think about killing myself since 2018, that year my grandfather discovered he had an incurable genetic disease, something I never imagined, my parents are separated, so he was like a father to me, besides he being the  person with whom I spent the most of my time, continuing, after he discovered this disease he spent the whole year in hospital, when he was discharged he returned to my house, but he only spent about three days until he returned to the hospital, with the disease progressing he started to lose weight to the point of weighing almost twice as little as I, who am already thin, in addition to the progress of the disease he developed depression, normally I often visited him, but from time to time he didn't have enough energy even to  greet me. 

On November 11 he had an internal hemorrhage, that same day I went to visit him, my mother did not warn me of anything, when I arrived he was bleeding a lot, but he did not know, he was very happy because of  strong antidepressants that he was taking, but he felt pain, even after taking morphine, seeing someone I loved very much dying in front of me and being unable to do anything was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, he died on 13  November at 6:50 am.


That same year I started having suicidal thoughts, I spent most of the time alone, since my mom and grandma were always in the hospital, my mom was much stressed and often told me that I was just born to disturb her, that i was no good for anything and things like that, over time I started to isolate myself at school and become an introvert, I talked almost every day with CVV (Similar to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in my country) because I felt very lonely, but no matter how much time passed, suicidal toughts only increased. That same year I took the exam to enter a school that is considered the best in my state believing that i would be better. 

In 2019 I went to the school that I took the exam, but due to my introvert even with a month of classes I still didn't have any friends, I ate lunch alone and came home alone, in that period I almost tried to commit suicide, but luckily I managed to make some friends. On the other hand, the school's teaching is horrible, and I can't learn almost anything, I usually got good grades, but at this school I get horrible math grades, which makes me feel like a crap, in addition to the school being very tiring in general.

That same year I started to like someone, the second time it occurred to me, but the person I liked already liked someone, the problem is that I started to compare myself with the crush of the person that I liked, which decreases even more my self-esteem, over time I started to compare myself with anyone, always coming to the conclusion that I suck, only increasing my suicidal toughts.  I talked to my mother about my suicidal thoughts, she said that I would start going to the psychologist earlier this year, but until now she apparently forgot, which shows how important I am to her. 

I don't have a hobby, I can't like almost anything i do, I hate waking up early to go to a place that suck, my self-esteem is only getting worse, I can't take pictures of myself for 2 years because every time that I see myself I realize how ugly I am, I have no more plans, I hate myself so much, I hate my appearance, voice, personality, everything that i'm, if I kill myself I will not be missed by anyone, I am replaceable in all areas of my life, my friends only talk to me because I often do jokes and my mom just pretends to care about me because she doesn't want the money she spent on me to be in vain. 

No matter how long I wait, things just get worse and worse. It's been three days since I have slept 4 hours because I am very anxious, I just want to end the bad joke that is my life, nothing is going to change, nothing is going to get better, I have no reason to continue supporting it every day. 

Every day I take the subway to go to my school, and every day I think that jumping there would not be a bad idea, I don't know what to do, I think it will just happen, anyway that don't makes a difference to anyone...",t2_177ld2cn,11,0,0,"Everytime i take the train i think about killing myself. Hi, I'm a 15y/o student, not a native speaker and using Google Translator, so maybe this text can be confusing.


Going straight to the point, I think about killing myself since 2018, that year my grandfather discovered he had an incurable genetic disease, something I never imagined, my parents are separated, so he was like a father to me, besides he being the  person with whom I spent the most of my time, continuing, after he discovered this disease he spent the whole year in hospital, when he was discharged he returned to my house, but he only spent about three days until he returned to the hospital, with the disease progressing he started to lose weight to the point of weighing almost twice as little as I, who am already thin, in addition to the progress of the disease he developed depression, normally I often visited him, but from time to time he didn't have enough energy even to  greet me. 

On November 11 he had an internal hemorrhage, that same day I went to visit him, my mother did not warn me of anything, when I arrived he was bleeding a lot, but he did not know, he was very happy because of  strong antidepressants that he was taking, but he felt pain, even after taking morphine, seeing someone I loved very much dying in front of me and being unable to do anything was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, he died on 13  November at 6:50 am.


That same year I started having suicidal thoughts, I spent most of the time alone, since my mom and grandma were always in the hospital, my mom was much stressed and often told me that I was just born to disturb her, that i was no good for anything and things like that, over time I started to isolate myself at school and become an introvert, I talked almost every day with CVV (Similar to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in my country) because I felt very lonely, but no matter how much time passed, suicidal toughts only increased. That same year I took the exam to enter a school that is considered the best in my state believing that i would be better. 

In 2019 I went to the school that I took the exam, but due to my introvert even with a month of classes I still didn't have any friends, I ate lunch alone and came home alone, in that period I almost tried to commit suicide, but luckily I managed to make some friends. On the other hand, the school's teaching is horrible, and I can't learn almost anything, I usually got good grades, but at this school I get horrible math grades, which makes me feel like a crap, in addition to the school being very tiring in general.

That same year I started to like someone, the second time it occurred to me, but the person I liked already liked someone, the problem is that I started to compare myself with the crush of the person that I liked, which decreases even more my self-esteem, over time I started to compare myself with anyone, always coming to the conclusion that I suck, only increasing my suicidal toughts.  I talked to my mother about my suicidal thoughts, she said that I would start going to the psychologist earlier this year, but until now she apparently forgot, which shows how important I am to her. 

I don't have a hobby, I can't like almost anything i do, I hate waking up early to go to a place that suck, my self-esteem is only getting worse, I can't take pictures of myself for 2 years because every time that I see myself I realize how ugly I am, I have no more plans, I hate myself so much, I hate my appearance, voice, personality, everything that i'm, if I kill myself I will not be missed by anyone, I am replaceable in all areas of my life, my friends only talk to me because I often do jokes and my mom just pretends to care about me because she doesn't want the money she spent on me to be in vain.

[SERIOUS] how did you feel after failed suicide attempt," 

Hear me out, I know this might sound like a troll post but please let me get my story out and I hope to get feedback from this.

I just got out of the VA hospital for a 5 day stay in the mental health ward. They were really good people and I can not say enough praise about them but I have to lead everyone up to the point on which they were able to help me.

Before the cause of my stay in the hospital I honestly thought that people who self harmed was just people looking for attention or that maybe had some kind of fetish. I do my best not to judge people based on just one insight I have of the person but to be honest I've only knew a few in my life, a total of two to be honest and from knowing them in the aspects that they showed to the world I deemed them ""attention whores"" and never thought about it much ever since.

Last week I tried to take my life. The reasons honestly doesn't matter it could be ptsd, general life related or just simple lack of sleep.

I had my plan together, wife was at work, only mother-in-law was home and upstairs, I placed my dogs in my room and I was going to go into the back yard with a glock 38 .45 acp. I called 911 and informed them that they would have a body to pick up at this address and where it would be located. The Operator tried the normal stuff such as think of your family and friends and how much you would be hurting them with some other stuff but I was half way listening to be honest because my goal was to bed dead and the cops take my body before my wife and step kids got home.

so I laid down in the backyard next to the pool and fire pit I had put in years back, my left arm laid in dog shit and I just groaned to my self ""this isn't what I want to leave behind"". I wiped off the dog shit the best I could so at least it wouldn't be obvious to the first person that found my body that I willingly/mistakenly laid it in. I hear rambles on my smart phone not sure what she was saying but I'm guessing she was going through a checklist and then I brought the pistol up to my head.

I took a big deep breath and well you know the outcome I couldn't pull the trigger. I a man that has spent literally years in Iraq being shot and bombed against could not pull the fucking trigger....

The amount I hatred I felt for myself and for life as a whole will never be done in that moment. ""You had 1 fucking job and you couldn't do it"" ""you pile of shit, gutless little faggot that always cried out for a way out but when it came you didn't have the balls"". Words honestly can not do justice to the emotions I felt at the time. I already give the 911 operator my info so I knew I only had limited time to finish what I started.

I did not have a back up plan when I started this because I honestly thought I could take the shot. my mind jumped to slitting my wrist in all the Hollywood cliches movies I've seen in the past. I ran into my kitchen. my heart is pounding because I know I'm on a timer, the cops are coming and I need to be dead before they get here but I need to die outside. I grabbed a hand full of knifes that was in the butcher block thingie not sure what its called but it held 8 of them and came out with 3. I started cutting my left wrist with the biggest which I thought would be the sharpest and it just tore the skin. ""shit its dull"" then I grabbed the next one and rub my thumb across its blade in a right to left motion. It was also dull as well as the third.

So here I am dog shit on 1/2 of my left arm a pistol with 1 round in it in front of me and 3 different kinds of knifes around me while cops are coming...

yea fuck that, I knew I had a sharp or at least what I thought was sharp leatherman type knife I had from a while back in my den. I ran in, grabbed it and went back to the spot I picked to die \*not sure why I picked this spot it just seemed like a nice place to die but I digress\*. I started slicing at my left wrist, the first time I have ever cut my self on purpose in my life and the knife was not as sharp as I thought it was so I kept slicing and it would dig in then jump to another spot repeatedly but at least it was sharper than knifes in the kitchen. The 911 operator is still on my smart phone and I cant hear a word she is saying but I do remember saying ""there we go"" when I first start seeing beads then what I thought was an artery of blood sprint forth my arm \*14 1/2 inches according to the nice people at the va and just kept repeatedly slicing.

Now during this time I thought I was done for so I was just going for style points and just to be sure. So I kept slicing and wincing at the pain when the knife jumped to another spot over and over again but with all the blood it was really hard to see what was being done and I just kept repeating the motion over and over again until I heard someone from my back right say my name and to drop the weapon. I do remember telling the officer that I'm not done yet. He yells at me again to drop the weapon and at this point I figure that I would listen to him because I'm already dead right? I've got my left arm covered with blood that has been stabbed and torn and sliced over 20 times no way I'm making my way out of this. I throw the knife down a good 5 feet from me and place my hand above my head as I was instructed I remember blood hitting my bald spot as I did this and was like ""yea, going to die in peace on a stretcher somewhere and not on grass with dog shit on it"". The Officer ask if I have any other weapons, I tell him I have a pistol with 1 round on it in front me. he ask that I stand up and by no means lean towards the pistol \*I have nothing but respect for cops I know they are like people and some fuck up and there are good and bad ones but I'm not the type of shitlord that tries to make things hard for them\* so I do what I'm told. The officer comes in front of me with a tact vest of some sort mostlikey running interceptor body armor \*that shit is a joke\* and an ar15 type rifle not sure if it was a sigg but he had his kit fully ready.

The officer reaches for the pistol thats around 2 foot in front of where I was squatting on the deck. he takes the pistol and throws it to the side. He had sunglasses on but if I was him I sure as hell wouldnt of taken an eye off of me. he ask if I had anymore weapon I tell him no. He then tells me to stand up and turn my back towards him which I do. He then ask me to lift up my shirt which I'm guessing is to make sure I didn't have any hidden weapons on me and at this point another officer appears in front of me. I dont know when he got there or how but I didn't notice until it already happened.

The 2nd officer checked my waistband again for something that might be hidden and tells me to keep my arms up. at this point my left arm is covered in blood and its just dripping all over the stone decking. I'm waiting for the whole pass out and never wake up thingie to happen but since you've read this far you know that didn't happen. After both officers checked me they called in emts which got to work on my arm and in my mine I thought ""haha faggots ya too late, too slow on the draw /muahahhaha I win"".

The EMTs starts cleaning off the blood and for the first time I can honestly see the real damage I did and let me be everything but misunderstood here ""I was fucking ferrous"". My entire arm that was covered in blood and I thought I was done for was just a shit load of nicks and scratches. 20 or 30 times I carved with the knife it was just jumping from 1 point to another very few places did it have what I would even call a decent cut.

So after the EMTs clear me the 2nd officer is talking with me and me being the big bitch I am had been crying the entire time in hopes that the cutting would put and end of my life/suffering. The 2nd officer tried doing the whole ""what about you friends and family"" speech bullshit which before then I thought was just a trope so I told him I'm a selfish asshole and I just want this one thing.

we go back and forth not sure for how long, maybe 15 mins \*I'm not the best judge of time\* before I'm handcuffed and put in back of a squad car then moved to another one because its 1 guys launch break \*this is true a fuck and in the moment I'm like yea ok let the guy get some food because everyone hates working on there lunch break\* so I'm moved into the other car and we make the way to the largest VA hospital in my area. The reason we are going to the VA is because they have seen me before on thoughts of suicide but this was the first time I've taken action. \*if your asking why a guy who had seen the doc about suicide stuff still have a weapon, its simple really. I locked it in a quick release safe that only my wife has/had the code to. it took me 5 mins with a flat head screw driver to open it so keep that in mind if you have a quick release safe because of kids\* I get to the hospital which took around an hour and the entire time cop number two was talking to me. IMO he is a good guy, not he's a cop so he's a good guy but he honestly seemed to care about what was going on.

I'm in the va hospital, cop number 2 talks to another cop there and says I'm non combative would he like for me to stay in restrains or not. cop number 3 says nah take'm off. so there I am, pissed at the entire world and myself most of all in a lil room with glass doors with a small Hispanic nurse next to me and the 3rd officer keeping and eye on me in the distance.

I spent 5 days in the metal ward of the va hospital which help'ed me get thing back on track but because of all of this I think I like cutting myself now and I do not know what to do about any of this.

I'm to fucking unfit for manual labor, I'm to slow for fast paced jobs, my problem solving skills are shit and my ""creativity"" if you can even call it that is there but I have no will to execute any ideas. 

I see my life leading to nothing but being a burden to others. I have no redeeming qualities. Theres nothing here. I know my family would be devastated if I died but I also know they'll move on. Its selfish. But I don't know what else to do. I just... want my life to end. Please"

My reasons that I have are not even good its just no one will ever love me, I’m an asshole, I make people feel bad all the time, and I’m a waste. My friends tell me that I’m just gonna end up being a junkie behind a gas station. I’m also getting told I’m too young to be sad.

How to kill self without affecting my family?,,t2_5wiyu1mb,1,0,0,How to kill self without affecting my family? 
Don’t know what to do,"So, I’m new to this. First time posting on Reddit or anywhere. I’ve talked with people in the past, no real help. 

From anyone’s perspective, I have a good life. Wife, kids, good career, healthy family. Literally nothing to complain about. Most anyone would say I’m lucky, and I am for the most part. I’m an ass for complaining. 

Despite all that, I wish I was dead. Every day. All the time. I don’t have the courage to kill myself. It would devastate so many people around me. The logical part of me knows it isn’t true, but my gut tells me they’d all be better off without me here, even if they don’t know it. I give no value to anything. There’s nothing I really can contribute. 

I’m 38, and I’ve felt this way for as long as I can remember. I can’t connect with people.  Not really. I don’t have any legit friends, just people who kinda know me. I’m incapable of making emotional connections. 

I have nobody to talk with about this. I don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish by posting this. I’m just lost and have nowhere to go. I just want to not be here anymore, for it all to just go away, like I never existed. This keeps getting worse, and I know nothing will fix who I am.

It's been a brutal 2020,"I left my job in July of last year. A very good job, my career. My depression got to be too much to put up with living where I was. I had a plan in place when I made this decision, but it fell through. Despite this, I was able to pay all of my bills through living frugally and with my savings I accrued over the few years I had been making good money, which was enough to get me to this point. I have been applying for jobs all over the place and because I've wrecked my credit so bad from paying rent on it to get by once savings ran low, I can't even rent a car through Uber to drive for them. I'm ten days past due on rent and my landlord is hounding me everyday, I don't blame him. I turn 33 in a week and I am a failure. I am never happy, every time I think I'm taking a step forward I end up taking two steps back. I know a lot of people in this world have it worse than me and I feel like a piece of shit every day that I can't pull myself out of this rut. I wish someone would have taken a chance on me, all I've ever wanted to do was work to be able to live. I don't have that much, but I don't even have enough to pay for that. I am sorry for letting you all down. I just can't do it anymore. Depression is a real son of a bitch. I wish I had insurance so I could get help. But I just can't take it anymore.

just posted this as a comment but even there no one answered,"i have these thoughts about dying alot. 
the first time i remember was when i was 13 and saw a kid from my school run over by a car and i wished it was me. 
then until like 18 i was in my teen angst emo phase and wrote poetry about death. that time everytime i crossed a street i imagined to just stop and be run over or if i was in plane i wished there was an accident and stuff like that. after that i went to study abroad and the thoughts went away and i thought i overcame everything. 

however, now im 26 and am right back. 
i wish i was dead not everyday but like three times a week. i don't wanna kill myself, because i don't wanna be a burden on my husband and his family. like i don't want them to have to clean after me or think they did something wrong. i just pray thst i will die. 
i thought that maybe drowning in the ocean near my house would be ideal. no cleaning after and it could look like an accident. i don't want to be a burden after i die, so an accident would be great, so noone thinks they did something wrong. 
to why i feel like that.
  i just think that i am not contributing to anyones life. like i am a waste of a life or just a burden. without me here everyone would have an easier and happier life. 
 i believe in reincarnation and pray everyday to be a tree in ny next life so i can be useful and give humans oxygen or become someones favorite chair or something. just be useful without harming anyone...

My whole family hates me,"My mother thinks I ruined her life. I fell into a deep depression, and she played the victim, saying that if I didn't go to school, then cps would come and I could say good bye to my brother, the only person I trust.
She took away the bag I kept my art supplies in, which were my only escape from this stupid life.
My father never does anything around the house, nor does he listen to anything I ask him or tell him.
My friends are growing more distant. One of them tries to analyze and ""fix"" my issues. Another one stopped talking to me after I put a trans flag on my locker. The only friend I was close to got transferred to another school. I have no means of communication with her. One of my friends said they felt betrayed by me telling my cousin I was gay before her. No one likes me. 
Another thing about my mother. She goes from saying she loves me to saying that if I left then she wouldn't really notice in less than 24 hours.

I'm the daughter of a whore and a deadbeat. if i go on i'll ruin my aunt too,"My mother is a great woman... to everyone except me. she hit me and called me a pig. she insulted me to the point where i felt nothing but self hatred. she never believed me when i said i was depressed, years later i've been diagnosed and prescribed or it.

Mother would sleep with random men in the room next to me. i remember hearing it so clearly. i remember grabbing my pencil sharpener and unscrewed the blade.
that was my second suicide attempt. i was 11

She told me i was jealous of her that i'd never be in love. she told me this at 12 because a asked her to stop sleeping with my friends dad. he was married. 

my mother pulled on my hair so hard that i no longer have feeling in my scalp. 

My dad has 9 kids. i am the 5th. when i moved to his house in 2019 i had never met him before. 

he had to work constantly to pay off child support. i never really saw him.

i moved to my aunts this summer. she and her husband where amazing at first. but i began to let my true self creep through.

my entire family here are introverted. i'm extroverted. they get stressed when i'm around. not to mention i'm a drag money wise. 

no matter where i go i cause problems. 

this is why i'm going to kill myself. 

i need to help the people around me by ending my horrible existence.

but i know i won't want this. i'm 15. i have a ""life"" ahead right? there isn't a god, so if i end it that's it.

Okay so basically,"No one likes me and I wanna die bc I'm crippelingly lonely even around ppl I'm close to. I can't help but have this constant anxiety that everyone around me hates me and wants me to be quiet. And with this worry, I sure do got the balls to be the class clown. 

My favorite part is that I've convinced myself on multiple occasions that no one gives a shit and would shrug it off if I shot myself.

Arrested for drinking in public with the intention of killing myself. Desperate for advice,"I was told to come to this subreddit as you guys might have the information or resources to help me out.

I got arrested for being drunk in public last night. I was using the alcohol as liquid courage as I had intended to jump off a freeway overpass last night.

I keep changing my life around running from my mind and it feels like it can only end one way,"I've never had a job for a year, not that I've ever been fired, just that my mind starts exploding after a couple months of working somewhere, like a couple months feels like eons. I'm twenty, been working since about 16 and have worked 7 different jobs, the longest for 9 months. Just feels like time is flying by and crawling at the same time, I have my whole life ahead of my but that feels too large, so difficult, I don't know. I just left a good paying job (starting $20 an hour) at a fortune 100 company, great room for growth, 5 minutes from home where I lived for free with parents. Had a girlfriend there, gym membership, good group of friends, good (for the most part) family life. Then I just melted down and now I'm in LA at a friend's place, bought a bike and planned on riding across the country for awhile camping because I was literally losing my mind in the stability. I worked in a call center doing IT and going in felt like my soul was being sucked out literally, I would have full body convulsions in mental agony at the place, no joke. Now I'm here and I just feel stupid, I'm not exactly upset I left such a good situation behind, (for context I was living in New England, so I'm across the country now) I don't have a real plan. Another friend here said he would get a place with me here but am I just going to get stuck in more jobs I hate and eventually leave? I don't know what I like. I try so many things and I always burn out of them so quick. I can't hold down a decent hobby. Guess my only really favorite thing to do motorcycling, or anything dangerous. I feel like this is because I like feeling close to death. Cliche but it's the only time I feel alive at all, other times I just feel like I'm floating through dead space worthless. I'm also hopelessly addicted to porn, would sometimes tell gf that I wasn't into it tonight so I could wait for her to fall asleep and then go masturbate to porn in the bathroom. Sad. People get the impression I'm really smart and do cool things which idk, I guess I do but never feel fulfilled. Just feels like this can't go on for decades, it has to end? I'm so obsessed with more, more sex, more money, more experiences, more adrenaline, more friends, more followers, to the point where I can't feel fully alive for anything. FUCK!!!!!!

Did anybody else experience this because I don't know what to do anymore and nothing helps,"Tl;dr: I nearly died and think I did and don't know what to do.

So last summer I was doing pretty good. I was clean and sorta sober for a few weeks and I was not feeling as suicidal for once.
And then I nearly died, which I don't want to get into too much detail about tbh.
The week after, I was convinced that I had actually died. That my live wasn't real. I ignored these feelings but they have become stronger again.

I don't really know how to deal with that because it makes everything I do insignificant since I do not really exist. Maybe none of you exist? There's this one part of my brain that says that I survived but this other part is determined to convince me that I didn't. It's so weird and I am really torn between them.",t2_5t9f1wg4,1,0,0,"Did anybody else experience this because I don't know what to do anymore and nothing helps Tl;dr: I nearly died and think I did and don't know what to do.

I feel like dying would be the best thing for me cause i cant see myself living a life like everyone around me. Im too weak. And i should at least have had the courage to get the fuck out, but guess what? Im too weak.

Actually worthless,"I have been more and more coming to the conclusion that I am useless.  I'm a young adult; around my 20s. I haven't accomplished anything but a basic education. I've worked before in fast food restaurants, but I had to stop due to a health problem. I now can't really work because of this health problem. However, I am doing uni. 

The uni is the only thing going for me. I can't work and I have to see my father and mother, who are both very tired and have physical pains from repetitive work, go out and cover my ass. Me and my fiancee also broke up, because of various problems. I thought that after I went back and focused on what I was doing it would get better. But no. I have noticed my lack of ability in all forms, such as in English, maths, basic knowledge, skills in videogames, music (I play guitar), editing, basically everything.... All the things I like doing don't bring me joy and I suck. I sleep about 14 hours a day and whenever I wake up I just want to die. I just don't feel like life is worth it and I'm definitely not anything that needs to be alive. I can't be bothered to go anywhere anymore and life is on autopilot. Even my friends are calling me out on my lack of abilities on games. I feel tired of being alive. I think that I should put the effort and get better at things and try to continue, but I feel like I can't be bothered. I just don't get joy from it anymore or maybe I'm so sad that it doesn't matter.

When I was a kid I believed that I was going to be good at something. However, that could not be further from the truth. I am so mediocre it's insane. I am a terrible human being also, coward and afraid of everything regarding my future. I just want this all to be over. I don't feel like it will ever get better.

Unfortunately I'm back,"I'm honestly so fucking lost.
If you look at my post history it's quiet a long trek between here and r/depression.
I don't know what to do, ive had spells of feeling good but they are usually fleeting.
This time I can't even say it's something specific triggering it. But I guess I'm just starting to feel like I'm an empty space.
I've got a decent group of friends from high school and quite a few people from uni I interact with on a friendly basis but I feel like my mood is starting to take its toll aswell.
I don't shower often enough so I smell, my beard is not taken care of and I've not seen a hair dresser in ages. Im getting fatter and I'm falling behind on course work but I just can't motivate myself. Does any of you know a painless way of killing yourself?

"Feeling low, have thought about ending it","I'm new here and given my username you can tell I want this to be anonymous, I want to be able to get my emotions out there without strings attached.
Recently I went through alot that got me to think about killing myself but there's alot more to my history that really only makes what has happened all the more painful. Hope it isn't a bother, I'm sure others have been through alot more.
I want to be clear but not make this a novel so if anyone is willing to read this and needs/wants clarification I'll try to provide as best as I can: I was molested when I was a little kid, it was a one time incident but it screwed me up royally once I remembered(I had repressed the memory). In addition to that I'm on the higher end of the spectrum, which only made school an absolute shit show. Combine the two, with me remembering at the end of middle school, and suicide had been at the front of my mind for years. I was able to fight it for awhile, eventually made more friends and revealed to some of them what happened with a surprising amount of support. Slowly I was able to put my suicidal thoughts in the backseat of my head and move foward, trying to figure out a career that will allow me to help people(really in anyway, try to make some days brighter for others in a way I didn't for years).
So why am I here?
My friend introduced me to someone else, we'll call them H, H is someone who has been in an abusive home, has substance abuse problems and a huge problem with opening up to people. My friend figured I could help them. To a degree I did-they became more outgoing in regards to being emotionally honest, being more accepting to therapy(something they had been going through but experiencing doubts about)and even went to get help with the substance abuse. We became fast friends.
What recently happened was that someone H knows told them that I had abused someone at a party while in high school. This abuse mentioned is a claim that I sexually assaulted someone by trying to grab them. I didn't. The very thought of abuse of any kind, that especially, makes me sick. H has cut ties with me, someone I came to care about has come to see me as something that I'm not. Something disgusting. With H being someone I care about and having had, I'll admit, helped me by giving me someone who I could help...it got me thinking about ending it all(I'd say how/my idea of how I'd do it but I don't want to risk being explicit)I talked to my best friend today about it, they encouraged me to try my best to move on and seek therapy(my friends have all tried to nudge me towards seeking professional help for years but I've just never gone). My best friend got me through the day but I'm so fucking distraught and while I don't think I'll ultimately go that way...having the suicidal thoughts pop up to the front of my head again is a really bad sign and I don't know how good my judgement will be in the next couple of days. What should I do? How should I cope with this?

Death by small airplane,"Repost for day people. 

So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

School was one of the only places I really felt happy. But now that feeling is gone . I dont feel like I belong anywhere and that no one likes me for who I am. Which then lead to me acting differently around people.

Need help with my suicidal cousin.,"She's a 14 year old student and apparently from what she told me she wants to die.  


She said cries every night because of family issues, it even got to the point where one day she tried stabbing herself in the stomach but luckily her mother was able to stop him and only a scar was made.  


She said her friends are trying to keep her away from sharp objects such as knives etc.

Sadly she doesn't want to undergo a medical check up because obviously she's suicidal and wants to die.

(HELP) Does my dad have autism? Or a mental disorder? He is abusive and socially inept,"Does my dad have autism? (When my dad was younger, some people would ask my aunt if he had aspergers) Front temporal lobe dementia? Brain damage from a heart attack during heart surgery a decade ago? A Brain Tumor? Chemo brain? What is wrong with him? 

My dad is the most awkward and strangest person to ever live. I wish my dad was dead. I’m a 21 year old female, and My dad (M/60) is the root of my severe treatment resistant depression and severe anxiety. He is physically and verbally abusive, sexist, apathetic, cold, he is EXTREMELY socially awkward and is socially inappropriate, and sometimes acts psychotic. 

(Trigger warnings: suicide) 
Some background: I survived a suicide attempt via drug overdose on my 19th birthday. And I am going to start ketamine infusions this month because all antidepressants have failed me. I live with my mom (F/60) and my sister (F/22) and my dad. I am a freshman in community college (I started late, due to multiple stomach problems, Gastroparesis, Hiatal hernia, Stomach ulcers, esophageal ulcers, GERD, IBS, gallbladder problems/removal, 4 stomach surgeries, probably caused by extreme stress)....I’ve tried to move out 3 times since I was 16. I’ve stayed with a family friend but was rejected by their adult kids who didn’t want me living there, I’ve stayed with my grandma, but she lives extremely far away from my college, and she recently broke her leg and is in a rehabilitation/physical therapy center. I’ve stayed with my aunt, but my stuff was continuously stolen, all of my makeup was stolen, (they had a cleaning lady who came to clean once a week) and I was in a very small storage room that made me depressed. And my aunt says now is not a good time for me to be living there Because of her personal issues. So I’m stuck at home for now. I’m on disability for my Depression and paralyzed stomach, but I want to get a job this summer, hopefully I’ll be more mentally stable by then.....I love art, music, and dancing, but I am way too depressed and unmotivated lately to create anything. I am failing some of my college classes....


My dad is the most severely awkward person I’ve ever known. I bet my mom only married him because his parents had some money. He can’t form sentences properly, he has an awkward walking gait (he is hunched over and his neck will lean forward and bob up and down, has little arm swing movement, his hands are always in fists, and his feet drag and hit the ground loudly. Even hearing him walk gives me anxiety), he will only talk about his interests, uses awkward hand gestures to describe things that don’t match what he’s saying, He has an EXTREMELY loud voice, and he will interrupt people constantly while they're talking mid-sentence. He doesn’t even make eye contact with me when I try to talk to him, he will just say “uh-huh” or “oh” to everything I say. Recently I shared my dance video with him (I take dance classes) and his reaction was an indifferent “Oh.” But when I make a small mistake he will have a paragraph to say to me. One time I accidentally clogged the toilet at 2 am and the next morning there was some water on the ground. I cleaned it up, and my dad yelled at me and said I’m irresponsible, inconsiderate, that I don’t care about people (Lol what?). He makes inappropriate facial expressions at random times. He will make a painful cringe face anywhere for no reason, at a restaurant, etc. I asked him why is he making that face and he accused me of insulting him. He can’t speak properly. He recently asked me “D-Do ya think over-over proportion coronavirus?” And I think he was trying to ask “Do you think the coronavirus is blown out of proportion?” He also repeats words in every sentence. His new favorite word is “Basically.” Basically this happened and basically she basically did that, which happened basically” is all I hear. He takes HUGE bites of food and overly stuffs his mouth when eating. He’ll make random grunting noises for no reason, when he’s walking to the living or randomly. Sometimes I think he “stims” He will rub his hands together very fast for a few seconds. I’ve tried to get him to see a doctor, I’ve tried to get my mom to get him to see a doctor, but nothing is happening...I think the next part is probably one of the most socially inappropriate things he’s ever done


Last year I was helping my musician friend film a music video and my dad drove me and my sister to help. Her family and friends were there and it was great, we had a normal calm conversation about camera work, and then, out of fucking nowhere, my dad starting excitedly yelling unintelligibly and moving his hands erratically. He seemed to be very excited about something for no reason. He said “ITHHFKSBBF FUEHRBD WKSJDBR EJDJRJF!!!” All while smiling and moving his hands back and forth towards his face quickly. And then he put his hands in his pockets and thrusted his hips forward and did a dance and stuck his tongue out. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK. 

My friends and her family ignored him because they thought he was a homeless guy on drugs at first!!! He went up to her mom and tried talking to her but she ignored him (as she should). I know he doesn’t take drugs, I know him, and I was with him all day. I was too embarrassed to say he was my dad. And he waited outside in the car while we filmed inside. There have been several other instances of him doing weird shit like this, and I’ll look down in shame. I used to cry about it as a teenager. I never have any friends over. I’m introverted and have social anxiety, and I’d like to invite friends over, but I don’t want them to meet my dad or have my dad pull shit. 

He doesn’t have any close friends, his mom and sister cut ties with him, his nieces hate him his brother in law hates him, everyone hates him. and he only talks to random strangers about sports. That is literally ALL he ever talks about to people outside his family. Always sports. Nothing else. He can’t learn basic things like changing the tv signal from HDMI to the DVD player, he will get pissed if I don’t change the tv for him. He can’t learn the basics of playing a board game and he lashed out and screamed because he didn’t understand, and I was 15 at the time. He is extremely scarily obsessed with saving money, he never buys me or anyone birthday gifts or Christmas gifts. He doesn’t heat or cool the house, he digs in public trash cans to find bottles and cans to recycle them for a few bucks. When I was younger we’d go to subway to share a 5 dollar foot long, and he’d complain to the cashier “That’s expensive!” As if the cashier would lower the price just for him. One time I was at a restaurant and my dad bought a kids meal for me. I was 19 at the time. I’ll elaborate more on his extreme cheapness. He doesn’t care about anyone. 

My dad has abused me over the smallest things. He physically and verbally abused me when I was a teenager. He isn’t abusive anymore, but I have extreme anxiety around him, and he lives at home and is unemployed. Even when I’m not at home or around him, I am extremely anxious. I have constant intrusive thoughts about how much I hate him and I am seeing a therapist and we are working on skills to help me tolerate my dad. But it’s not working. I’ve tried EMDR therapy, TMS therapy. So I am looking for a new therapist and possibly DBT therapy so I’m not so sensitive about him. He is unemployed And has been for 10
Years because he has Basal Cell Carcinoma (undeadly, just annoying skin cancer), and takes chemo drugs. Also more than a decade ago he had a mechanical heart valve replacement and he had a heart attack during surgery. Maybe it damaged his brain, and that’s why he acts the way he does? I know he’s probably mentally sick but at this point I have no sympathy for him. He abused me over the dumbest things. Like I mentioned, he is obsessed with saving money. He never heats or cools the house (California summers are hell) and when he caught me turning the AC on he screamed in my face “I’m the boss of you, you fucking bitch!” Another time when I was 14, he punched me in the face because I was crying from worrying about a test. He’d push me, kick me, pin me to a wall, He’s called me ugly, fat, stupid, worthless, crazy, mentally ill, fucked up, bitch, etc. a year ago I asked him why he calls me a bitch. He said in a mean tone “Because you have mennal illness.” (He says “mental” like “mennal”). He also calls my mom and sister a bitch, and he has sexist rants about “Why are three females dominating me? Back then men were in charge!” And he says “But I’m the man of the house!” My mom ignores me whenever I tell her that he abused me. I think she’s afraid of divorce and losing money or maybe she’s afraid of being alone even though this fucker makes me want to end myself. Trust me, I’ve tried talking to her about it. She told me he wasn’t always like this...so does that rule out The autism diagnosis?

I had an eating disorder at 14, was very underweight, and I didn’t have a period for a year. Years later when I gained weight and became healthier (5”4, 125 lbs) He encouraged me to lose weight. He said “Don’t you wanna be like that? Not having a period?” He’s dumb.

On my 10th birthday when my mom bought me an American Girl Doll (costs about 100+ dollars) he was in his room, saw the receipt, and literally screamed at the top of his lungs for a good 30 minutes. And I mean SCREAMING. just unintelligible demonic yelling. I had been obsessed with American girl for years before my mom got me that doll. I was always playing with my friends dolls and looking through the AG catalog. It was supposed to be a special gift and he ruined it. I never played with that doll because of that. He obsessively checks everyone’s receipts. He has had public freakouts over items being “too expensive.” When I was 12 I wanted to see a movie with my friend and her parents, and my dad freaked the fuck out because of the “expensive movie tickets” and stayed and waited in the car the whole time. Another time when I was 10 he rented a movie for one dollar and if you lose the film you have to pay 8 dollars for the film. So one time my friend was over and my sister accidentally misplaced the movie and he screamed and cursed at her “you better fucking find it!” My friend asked me “what is wrong with your dad?” 

Gross: he never flushes the toilet or washes his hands to “save money.” He is disgusting. And he only takes showers at the gym. 

I guess a pro about him is that he has a strict daily routine and wakes up at 4 am every morning to exercise (damn I wish I had that motivation, I probably would if he wasn’t in my life). And then he spends most of the day cleaning. But if anyone interrupts his routine he flips out. When I was 13 I made an art piece of a portrait of a girl and I guess I made the forehead too big because he mocked it and said “ET, ET.” His responses are short and stupid. 

He also exhibits sexually inappropriate behavior. One time when I was 16 and having dinner with my mom and sister, my dad was a few feet away from us and while he was making a sandwich he vigorously humped the kitchen counter, and my sister noticed and said in an irritated voice, “Papa what are you doing why are you humping the counter that’s gross.” And he just kept going and he said in a defensive voice “I’M DANCEN!” (I’m dancing) And just kept going. And my mom said “No, stop.”


(Trigger warning? Possible child abuse?) To preface this next part, I don’t know what the hell happened in this situation, but when I told a therapist about it she called a social worker to come to the house. When I was a 4 year old He used to walk around the house in his tidy whities a lot, and he’d play this game called “the scissors” and he’d put me between his legs and close them tightly so I couldn’t escape and I yelled for my mom and she would just tell him to stop without questioning wtf was going on. 
He knew I hated it but he kept doing that stupid “scissors” game. Idk wtf that was.

I know most people will say I’m an adult, I should get a job now and save up and move out. Trust me I wanna do that, depression is kicking my ass lately. I can barely function and do my homework. I hope medical ketamine will have effect on my depression. I am trying to eat healthy and exercise. I am also trying to work on college apps, I want to go to an art school and stay in the dorms. Hopefully I’ll get accepted to an art school. My friend’s family has roommates, and maybe I’ll ask if I can rent a room (I’ll have to share a tiny bedroom with 3 other people but maybe that’s worth it to be away from my dad) There are many things I can do about the stress of the situation. I just want to know what the hell is wrong with him. Life would be so much easier if he was dead. I hope he has a brain tumor. Ngl, I’m not that religious or anything, but every day I pray that he will die today. We have life insurance, I won’t be on edge anymore and I’d honestly be much better mentally and physically. I know, I’m an asshole. Please, answer away. Thank you...",t2_5wbw71je,5,0,0,"(HELP) Does my dad have autism? Or a mental disorder? He is abusive and socially inept Does my dad have autism? (When my dad was younger, some people would ask my aunt if he had aspergers) Front temporal lobe dementia? Brain damage from a heart attack during heart surgery a decade ago? A Brain Tumor? Chemo brain? What is wrong with him? 

My dad is the most awkward and strangest person to ever live. I wish my dad was dead. I’m a 21 year old female, and My dad (M/60) is the root of my severe treatment resistant depression and severe anxiety. He is physically and verbally abusive, sexist, apathetic, cold, he is EXTREMELY socially awkward and is socially inappropriate, and sometimes acts psychotic. 

(Trigger warnings: suicide) 
Some background: I survived a suicide attempt via drug overdose on my 19th birthday. And I am going to start ketamine infusions this month because all antidepressants have failed me. I live with my mom (F/60) and my sister (F/22) and my dad. I am a freshman in community college (I started late, due to multiple stomach problems, Gastroparesis, Hiatal hernia, Stomach ulcers, esophageal ulcers, GERD, IBS, gallbladder problems/removal, 4 stomach surgeries, probably caused by extreme stress)....I’ve tried to move out 3 times since I was 16. I’ve stayed with a family friend but was rejected by their adult kids who didn’t want me living there, I’ve stayed with my grandma, but she lives extremely far away from my college, and she recently broke her leg and is in a rehabilitation/physical therapy center. I’ve stayed with my aunt, but my stuff was continuously stolen, all of my makeup was stolen, (they had a cleaning lady who came to clean once a week) and I was in a very small storage room that made me depressed. And my aunt says now is not a good time for me to be living there Because of her personal issues. So I’m stuck at home for now.

Worthless. Unwanted. Unattractive. Not good enough. Not worth saving.,"I got into an argument with my husband the other day.  I was so mad I wanted to hit him.  Instead I grabbed a plastic fork and ran the tines over my arm.  He said he didn't like to see me hurt, but only made a half ass effort to stop me.  I told him to stay back and ran the fork over my arm again and again.  Then asked why he didn't stop me and he said because I told him to stay back.

I know I did, but at the same time I wanted to see if he cared enough to stop me regardless of what I said.  I didn't voice this to him, but now I know for a fact that he doesn't care about me.

He told me he's not attracted to me because of my weight and the fact that I'm plain.  But, when he was looking at porn he admitted he jacked off to women who were of the same height and weight. The difference was I was real, they weren't.

He told me he doesn't want to deal with my depression and anxiety, especially if he knows he might be contributing to it.  But, he's willing to engage with me when I'm happy and laughing, especially when he thinks he might be contributing to it.  And here I thought love in a marriage was supposed to be unconditional, through thick and thin.  Guess not.

I called him out on the fact I think he no longer loves me, as I no longer see it in his eyes, face, or hear it in his voice like I used to.  He has since stopped saying, ""I love you"".

Got a little hard bump (assumed that it was a cyst) near the testicle, its getting bigger at a faster rate now.
I think I've got testicular cancer, even though I am exasperated I'm going to the doctors tomorrow (have not got an appointment arranged). I am starting to give up, I have type 1 diabetes and autism so of course I'm going to be one of those people who goes through one health problem to the next until I die a nasty death, fuck that.
Before I was diagnosed with diabetes and got ill I wondered if I had diabetes voiced my concerns and people said I was fine, I wasn't.
Same things happening with my testicle, I am now wondering and nobody believes me. A cancer diagnosis is only an ultrasound test away. 

I'm so sick of this, and from now on I will think about killing myself until I actually do it. I know that testicular cancer has high survival rates but I'm inclined to think that once you get cancer your very likely to get it again.

Got a little hard bump (assumed that it was a cyst) near the testicle, its getting bigger at a faster rate now.
I think I've got testicular cancer, even though I am exasperated I'm going to the doctors tomorrow (have not got an appointment arranged). I am starting to give up, I have type 1 diabetes and autism so of course I'm going to be one of those people who goes through one health problem to the next until I die a nasty death, fuck that.
Before I was diagnosed with diabetes and got ill I wondered if I had diabetes voiced my concerns and people said I was fine, I wasn't.
Same things happening with my testicle, I am now wondering and nobody believes me. A cancer diagnosis is only an ultrasound test away. 

I'm so sick of this, and from now on I will think about killing myself until I actually do it. I know that testicular cancer has high survival rates but I'm inclined to think that once you get cancer your very likely to get it again. Fuck that shit, all I wanted was a peaceful life, not a life where I have to worry and check for any strange bumps inside of my asshole just to live for a little while longer. 

So yeah, I need to take control of my situation and give my defective body what it deserves, complete destruction because if a computer is fucking up like my body is then I'm probably gonna smash it to pieces too.

I need someone to talk to,"(English is not my first language)I always had suicidal thoughts since i was around 12. I dont even remember and i dont even know why. When i was 13-14 i was in love with a girl who always thought of me as a friend. So a wanted to kill myself of course (i was really dumb back then) then i had my first gf at 16 and life was amazing, i felt loved and important. I had a lot of friends back then. We agreed to break up in january(after 1.5 year), but we were still seeing each other as friends with benefits until last saturday. Basically what she did to me: she fucked me over around 5 times. One day she said she loves me and the next day she doesnt. And this kept going on i was confused, i couldnt sleep (i still cant) my grades are terrible, at the moment im failing 3 classes bc i cant concentrate. Now we got to the  point where she said that lets be just friends. She wants to move on. I just cant. I have lost a lot of friends there is only one person who i can turn to. I still have friends but they are not really friends who u want to discuss your suicidal thoughts with. I downloaded tinder although i have a lot of likes and matches 3 girls ghosted me and it made me feel unwanted. So basically matches and likes dont mean anything. There is a constant pain in my chest which does not seem to go away. Sorry for making it so unorganized and messy and long but i just wrote what i felt and what was on my mind.

I give up,"I’m done, I give up. I thought I may be tough enough for this life but I’m not. Each day feels like an eternity in hell, I’m suffering every single day I can’t take it anymore. Honestly I was stupid to ever think I even had a chance to be able to push through to the end. People say it gets better, but for me I honestly don’t think it will, I don’t even know why I’m still alive if all I’m doing is suffering. 

I doubt my life would end like this if I’d been born into a different situation, but I guess that would go without saying for pretty much any suicidal person. Looking back on my life I think my life was always destined to end this way, but I shouldn’t just blame my situation for this, honestly I’m the one at fault too. I’m pathetic, I’m the one who can’t overcome myself or my situation, honestly I probably couldn’t handle a normal life either, I’m just too unmotivated to do anything about my life, and I don’t want to blame that on anyone or anything else other than myself. 

Honestly this might not even be the end, in fact it probably isn’t. I’m probably going to come back to Reddit tomorrow and start posting again just like usual, this has happened a lot of times in the past. I’ve gotten really upset, I tell myself this is going to be the end, then either something happens that makes me feel better or it actually comes down to ending my life and I just can’t bring myself to do it, which just makes myself feel shitty as I keep telling myself I’m faking it and that I’ve made up all my struggles in my head. 

I dunno, maybe I’ll live maybe I won’t, either way I don’t think it’ll affect much, and honestly even if I do end up staying alive I think I still need a break from Reddit, the site’s been really helpful in some areas but has also played a part in my own self hatred, I think I need a break from it anyway, maybe a few days I dunno.

Tired,"I feel drained and I don't know why. I think about other people who have it worse than me and continue with their lives and I wonder how. I really thought I was getting better. I'm not entirely sure what's wrong with me but I really really thought I was getting through it. I started high school again and I did well in the first semester. And then I got sad again. I know it wasn't for no reason but I also know that if I could be just a little stronger emotionally I wouldn't sabotage myself, I wouldn't be so hurtful to my family or so negligent towards my friends. It's not like I don't try to work on myself or look for solutions but in the last two years I've become so weak. It seems like any little thing tips me over to the point I need to ruin at least one thing in my life. Sometimes it can be fixed but usually not fully. I feel like a horrible person all the time. I really think I am. I know I'm kind and polite for the most part but I also know I'm stubborn and bratty and I can be really mean to my family. 
I don't know why I came out so angry. I've always been so angry and nothing ever satisfied me, I cried all the time and I still do. 
I guess it's just easier to say I was born angry than to admit I'm a brat. 
I was so mean and ungrateful and now I'm just bitter.
If I was just nicer and less stubborn I know that my family wouldn't be as broken as it is now. 
All I had to do was be nice. Or at least happy. Even now that's all I need to do but I don't. 
I just feel so guilty because when I think about the problems that happened when I was younger they always seemed to be caused by me. My parents arguing, my siblings fighting, or even things that happened to myself. I'm always the cause. 
Now that my sister has gone a little crazy, my family probably thinks we're both demons but she's not. Only I am. 
All I had do was be nice to her but I've always been so narcissistic. I only paid attention to myself.  I was so mean to her. I remember once she wanted to read a book I hadn't touched for months and I took it back and got mad at her. And I think wow one of the biggest reasons I never fell into her crowd was because I liked and what if I had just let her read that book what difference would it made. There are so many moments where if I had just been a little less selfish or a little more happier I could've prevented so many conflicts. 
 I have some reason to be sad or angry but I'm 17 almost 18 and I know I can't keep blaming everyone for my shitty personality. 
I'm so hopeful about the future. I've always been. Even during the most depressing year of my life I still was hopeful. I just don't know how long I can deal with myself and everything in my life just running on hope. I'm so tired. Im not sleeping again and I constantly feel like throwing up. I feel so drained and as if I'm going to faint. I'm such a loser. I really never thought I'd be the person I am today. I can't even finish high school. I have no talents. No interests. My family finds me annoying or they hate me or both. I have good friends but I know i burden them alot and I know if I died they'd be okay. 
I just feel so lost and alone. I'm anxious and I never feel in control of myself. I just wish I was better person. I wish I was smart and pretty and talented and I wish I was kinder and braver and stronger. I wish I had been more selfless. 
I just hate so many things.  I hate myself. I hate my family. I hate how cruel the world can be and the fact that if there is a god then all the evil in the world was planned and how if there isn't one it means that that's just how the world is

University,Hey there reddit. For the past two years I had a reason to live. And everything was great. Whenever my depression got too bad i was able to control it because i was hoping that things would get better if i got into university for illustration. Its the only thing i care about. Today my first rejection letter came in and im still waiting for the other two responses. I will probably get rejected from both of them since i was rejected by my 3d choice which is an easier school to get into than the other 2. Im not sure if i cant handle being rejected by all the universities i applied to. Im not sure if I'll be able to find the motivation and reapply next year. I know its a very mundane problem to have. But i dont have anything else in my life that gives me a reason to continue living and art is the only thing i thought i was good at.,t2_5wf3dxiu,2,0,0,University Hey there reddit.

My life will never change.,"I'm starting to realize that my life will never change, it will remain the same no matter I do and that I will never be happy.

I'm twenty years old but adulthood is not what I thought it would be. By now, I thought I would be independent. That I would be far away from the the small, miserable town I was born in and that I'd have the social life I've always dreamed of. Most foolish of all, I thought I would be happy. So far, little has changed since I graduated high school.

I still live with a family who hates me, I still sleep in the same bedroom I've had since I was an infant. I still have no friends, no social life or charisma. The only things that have changed is that I've barely managed to keep a C average in college and that my day dreams are no longer enough to keep me satisfied.

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was twelve and nearly attempted on my 15th birthday. The only thing that kept me going were the ""It'll get better"" lies that I was dumb enough to fall for. After that, I anxiously waited until my high school graduation but was sick with the realization that things didn't automatically get better... God, I am a fucking idiot.

and to make matters worse, everytime, I talk about wanting to change, my family just discourages me. Like today, in the car, I told my grandmom that I was going to get a job and need advice on somethings. Instead of helping me, she just told me that ""I could never handle it"" and reminded of how ""socially retarded"" I am. I said ""what ever it takes to get me out of this town forever."" She just sneered and said ""it'll take years, if ever."" Hell, she wants me to end it all. 

Part of me wants to prove her wrong but I knows she's right. I need to face the fact that things will never change until I finally build up the courage to hang myself. Unless some miracle happens, unless someone comes into my life and takes me away from everything, I don't think I will make it to my twenty-first birthday.",t2_5wd0m95h,3,0,0,"My life will never change.

How do people feel about ‘tough love’ in this community?,"Sometimes, no amount of ‘your parents will miss you’, ‘I’m here if you want to talk’, ‘call this number’, ‘seek help’ and ‘you have so much to live for’ is enough. From experience, sometimes someone being firm but kind, challenging your ideation instead of trying to offer empty comforts, is exactly what you need. Do people generally agree or disagree with this sentiment? Is it the case that sometimes people need gentle reassurance and sometimes people need to have someone patiently challenge their reasoning for something and push them to see things from different angles? If someone was to engage you in a civil debate about your plans as opposed to simply saying ‘Don’t do that’, would you find it a helpful and potentially enlightening distraction or would it make you more likely to harm yourself? Does it depend on the person and their situation? Should a young teen struggling to cope because of cruel parents be nurtured while a person saying that everybody on the planet is awful and heartless should be firmly but kindly told that that isn’t the case?

Im worthless..,"My life has always been a rollercoaster i had my ups and downs but now its the lowest its been.

I have been thinking of suicide for quite a while becouse im practically useless:

I have surrendered at school,whole year and i haven't done any homework i get it from friends i don't and haven't understood any of the material this year.

On the test one of my friends lets me cheat ofg him which i really feel bad for.

The only girlfriend i had turned out to be lesbian and not actually liking me which took a big hit on my self esteem.

A couple of mouths ago i lost my best friend becouse of something stupid:

No he did not die but he stopped talking to me/ignoring me here's why:

One day we were coming back from school with a few friends and a black friend of ours (important in a bit) when we say some gypsyes (which we had a problem with) and my black friend said he wants to buy something from the bookstore which you only had to walk a bit forward but suddenly they go left and thw gypsyes start following them and from then on i don't know what happend .

I don't think anybody is gonna read this but to atleaat have it off my chest.

I fantasize of that day,"I would write a letter. Tell my family I'm going on a short vacation with my friend. Leave it somewhere they can find it, along with the very few physical things I love.

I'd catch a plane and visit my online friend - we've chatted for the past 10 years. I'd have a letter for him too, but I'd want to deliver it personally.

Then I'd catch another plane into a very isolated, small Canadian town. I was there last year. The temperatures are very low. 

I'd take my antidepressants and I'd walk out. In the night. The cold would kill me after a few hours. The beauty, that I have already seen, would be everything I want to see when I leave.

I think of all this, and I feel happy. It's not a plan for now - I'm waiting for my mom to go, first. I realized I can't do it while she's still alive. I've accepted to live as whatever I will be in the next few years. I don't have any ambitions - the bare minimum is fine. It's incredibly hard to keep on living when you've decided you wanna die, but I would do anything for my mom. 

But I dream of it when it gets too hard. Somehow, it feels like the only time in my life I would actually feel happy and in control.",t2_ljhk6,31,0,0,"I fantasize of that day I would write a letter.

Suffocating,"I'm suffocating. Drowning within a constant numbness that's been growing within me for years. There is nothing that satisfies me. Job, family, friends, sex, games whatever it may be. I feel nothing towards anything. I feel as though I'm stuck in a void, this never ending blackness that consumes me and pulls me away from the things that should be important or held dearly by me. 

I never want to get out of bed and it's an effort every morning to move. I go through my days having conversations with myself as to how I feel. This voice within me constantly berating me telling myself I'm worthless and have no place in this life. 

I have no desires nor wants, dreams or ambitions at best I just exist like a mosquito sucking the blood from whatever gives me a short burst of any kind of feeling other than this constant blunt scraping in the back of my head. 

I wear a mask every day for my wife who has her own things to deal with in which I try so hard to help with. For my mother who I don't want to worry about me. For my sister who is growing into a young woman and needs all the support she can get right now. For the few friends I have who just wouldn't understand or who I'm afraid would exile me for being different. For myself because the person I am inside my head is vulgar, dusgusting bile with no consistency no purpose. 

I just am. 

I don't rightly know what I expect to gain from this post other than a feeble attempt to romove the thoughts within me elsewhere for a time so as to be free for only a short while. I can't cope with this in my head any longer its like lice in my hair itching, scratching, scraping it never ends. I just need it to end, to stop. I need to silence the silence. 

I don't know how much more I can take the thoughts of suicide and death, while somewhat comforting are happening more and more often. I feel as though I'm caught in limbo and being pressured to make a choice.

I don't know what to think or do anymore. I'm becoming beyond overwhelmed,"Today was one of those days where I struggled to focus my eyes on what I wanted to pay attention to. I did a little running around with one of my closest friends and it felt like I was constantly out of focus and dimly aware. I don't even know if that makes a lick of sense.

I'm on Vyvanse. I was told that I probably had dysthymia (which is like very minor depression) and maybe a little anxiety, all related to ADD. Which, okay, fine. Because the Vyvanse worked sometimes. But it wore off today and everything else adds up. I just want to not exist. Like just letting myself sit and not think anything is pretty nice.

My mom doesn't consider our stay in her ex-boyfriend's house to be all that traumatic, I guess. I don't know if I'm lying when I say it was. I really hate myself. I despise my body, and my face. My personality is awful. I'm mean, and either too loud or mumbling, and I'm just wrong. I'm pretentious. Hypocritical. Every time I do something sexual I feel revolting, yet I keep meeting guys who I maintain such a relationship with. I had all these plans; I was going to be a lawyer and help my mom and dad. How can I function as an adult when I can't even like a part of myself?

I hate my dad, which makes me hate myself. He's pitiful. I hate him so much for what he did to my mom. And I resent my mom for what she put us through, even though essentially none of it was her fault. Recently, I've been really mad at her for all sorts of things.

I have a car, and I pay for its gas. I don't have my license, and she won't take me to get it because she thinks I'll fail, yet she also won't take me to practice driving. I know how to fucking drive. I can parallel park (not that it matters- I can afford to lose a mark here and there) better than she can. I need a car so I can get a job so I can leave faster. As it is, I have to live with her and her fucking boyfriend and her fucking chickens. 

I'm failing all of my classes. I'm in dual enrollment, meaning I take college classes that add a credit both for high school and college. If I fail a class, I'll have to go back to the high school next year. If I have to go back to the high school, I might actually kill myself. I'm not kidding when I say it. I had to go there yesterday for upcoming senior scheduling and I felt shaky and just fucking terrible.

It would be so much easier to just die. And better in general, because all I seem to be doing is making things worse. I'm going to fail these classes and wind up back where I was. And where my mom worked so hard to get me out of. I'm such a piece of shit. And listen to all of this, it's just some bullshit call for sympathy. What am I trying to get out of it, a kind word? What can any of you even hope to do, if you've even read this far? You can't do anything. We're all fucking awful. There is no such thing as a good person.

I'm struggling and I hate myself.,"Hi, everyone.

I wish and wait someone come to me, talk to me, talk about my problem but nobody is coming, or maybe, because I don't have a lot of friends who knows me better. Sometimes, I hurt myself too, I punched the desk, the door and the wall.

I also have an anxiety, when it comes,  I hurt myself because I coudln't handle it. I'm not afraid to kill myself but I feel guilty leaving them behind, leaving someone who cares about me.

Avoiding death by coincidence.,"I have probably tried to kill myself about 10 times now, with 3 of the times being very much intended to kill myself. What I mean is that most of the times I try to kill myself I lose my nerve. I don't own a firearm, or any drugs that I could easily overdose on but I do live close to the tallest bridge on the west coast so that's where I go. The problem is that its about a thirty minute drive there and 20 minute walk, by the time I actually get there I lose my nerve and erroneously convince myself that I could get help and get better. That was the story for 7 of the times I failed, I either get there and can't jump, or I convince myself on the drive that I can get help which I know is impossible, but I guess the human mind will try anything to save itself. The three times that I was for sure going to commit were also stopped by the most random of interactions. The first time came around January and I had failed to get the required internship for one of my classes, so I decided to kill myself that day. I decided to go to class anyway just in case I could delay the inevitable. Its a very early class, so I can usually get in there hours early and there is no one in there. That day I went in early and there was one other student in there who just happened to be in the same situation I was in, and he taught me how to drop out of the class and register for another one mid term so that I could stay a full time student and avoid expulsion. If I had decided to show up later on in the day or anything else I would be dead right now.

The second time came later in the quarter and I had parked my car much closer on the bridge this time, within eyesight, to make the walk shorter. It was around 1 am, and just as I was climbing over the suicide prevention fence a cop showed, he was just passing by and so I hid to not draw his attention. He eventually drove by my car and shown a strong flashlight into my car eventually doing a u turn going back towards town. I was terrified that he may tow it or something, and if I failed to kill myself I would be stranded there and have to call my family for help which would give the game away. So I told myself that I would park it somewhere else, and by the time I did that I had lost my nerve and drove back home. If I had shown up fifteen minutes later, or if that cop just never drove by there I would be dead today. 

The third time came just today, I need to register for graduation soon, but filling out forms and such terrifies me so I have been putting it off. However, just today I submitted some forms and the I had some panic attacks, thinking I had done it too late and would be expelled. I told myself that I was going to kill myself today becuase of this, but thought I should go see the academic counseling services for info just in case I lost my nerve once again. Well they told me that it was fine and I could still file to graduate and as such my motivation to die for that day disappeared again. Not that my motivation to die isn't still there, even if everything goes right, I still harbor an intense hatred for myself, as I always have. The point is that if I had decided to just leave class and not go to that counseling appointment I would be dead in a few hours. 

Has anyone else had this happen where you get so close to finally succeeding in killing yourself but something throws you off and end up failing. If I was religious I would assume divine intervention but I know that its just random bullshit.

I want to end my life at 20 years old,"There is nothing further for me to experience, no reason to continue living. On the surface, I have an ideal life. I am a 20 year old caucasian woman. Born to a wealthy family in a Westernized country, I was given every educational and recreational opportunity that one could desire. I have above-average physical attractiveness, which helps to compensate for my abysmal personality.

However, I have already squandered most of the advantages that I was born with. I chose a useless major when I entered college, and I am attempting to transfer in to my university's nursing program as a last-minute hail-Mary. There is no guarantee that I will get in, and if I don't, I would have wasted approximately $100,000 of my parents tuition money on a fucking *liberal arts*degree. My GPA is projected to drop to a meager 3.1 by the end of the semester, given the fact that I got a C on a midterm and multiple F's on reading pop quizzes. Even in the pre-nursing classes where I am motivated to work hard, I can barely scrape by with a B after hours of dedicated study time. I have aspirations to become a nurse anesthetist, but that dream is becoming increasingly unlikely due to my academic incompetence.

I despise myself so deeply that I often fantasize about hanging myself in my dorm room or throwing myself off of a building. Throughout my adolescence and young adulthood, I often wished that I could replace my soul with a perfect, emotionless automaton who got A's on every exam, ran marathons, collected a litany of accolades, and secured a high-paying white collar job. Just a placeholder who would make my parents proud so that they could boast to their country-club friends.

I will probably be a drain on society in the future, so I might as well end it all now. I cannot picture any amount of success in my future, despite my incredibly privileged upbringing. Family and friends have told me that I am a 7-8/10 on the scale of physical beauty, but all of my attempts at flirtation have been rejected.

Whenever I see successful individuals (doctors, lawyers, engineers, CEO's, programmers, scientists), I always feel sick to my stomach, despite the fact that these people are primarily responsible for economic and technological progression. I cannot live with my mediocrity anymore. I don't even think that I could marry someone who was more financially successful than me, even if it would be in my best interest to do so. My nonexistent self esteem simply couldn't handle it.

I have never been proud of anything that I have done in my entire life. I am a lazy, entitled, lackluster failure. It is only a matter of time before I gather the courage to commit suicide, to leave this ugly world forever.",anonymous,3,0,0,"I want to end my life at 20 years old There is nothing further for me to experience, no reason to continue living.

I didn't think I'd make a post here.,"Hi.. I don't know where to start with this, but it feels like everyday is taking longer and longer to move on, I constantly think about wanting to kill myself while driving anywhere honestly. I no longer have the motivation to continue, the only reason I have left is my mother. I want to get help, I want to change, but I feel like I've been a burden on my mother for so long. About one to two years ago, I had a breakdown during work and told my boss who then proceeded to call non-emergency police(I think) and ended having a ambulance take me to a nearby center for this kind of problem. I called my mom to pick me up because they were not going to allow me to leave work or that building alone, but I felt like it was nothing but upsetting for my mother to be in this problem where her youngest son is still having depression after having another break down when I was 13 in middleschool and was brought to a child care mental facility because I told another kid to kill himself but I outed myself towards the school therapist that I wanted to end my life. I was there for 3 days, but it felt like a month. I don't know why I was dealt such a shit start in the beginning of my life where I was getting bullied at school and god forbid my own home, by my brother and extended family. I was a living punching bag but I stayed quiet, I played along because I know no one wants to deal with my shit. no one ever has, even my own father was completely ignorant of my problems being a nurse and dealing with people like us. It was upsetting, how could no one see that I was in pain? All because I was putting on a act, I knew my mother knew but I feel like she is too afraid to help me... she probably isn't but I can't shake the feeling off. All through school I was always crying at least once a day in the bathroom during lunch because I knew was a fucking outcast. I didn't have any friends during middleschool, nor did I in elementary. I was bullied there the most actually, so I wasn't surprised. I had a small group of ""friends"" in highschool but that dwindled down to basically none so I am currently alone besides the group I have online. I've escaped my life so much through online games where I barely recall what I did as a kid. I'm only 22 but why do I feel like I've been here for 30?

I've already had the love of my life 4 years but she left me on a very vague string and I've been suffering since then, it's been a year or so since she apologized but I still hate it, she couldn't give me a reason on why she did what she did, be it regret, shame, or whatever other excuse. we haven't spoken since and I don't ever expect to meet her again.

Sorry mom sorry dad,"I am really sorry for everything. I am sorry for embarrassing you. I don’t even know how to tell you this. If you are reading this then I have probably killed myself. I am sorry it had to be this way but I was always evasive or my problems. I could never ever meet them head on. I am sorry I was weak. 
I messed up and I am sorry. I know I was always a good student but I really fucked up badly. I am three days away from my exam and I probably will mess it up. I don’t know the syllabus and I don’t know the material properly. 
You have probably invested lakhs into getting me tutors and have always been there. 
What I didn’t tell you was I was going through depression and constantly indulging in self harm. That with my careless attitude has cost me my future. 
You spent so much money out of your own pockets to put me through sat classes and tuitions and even money for my applications. 
I know how hard you worked to earn it, how you have gone from having nothing to being a really successful 
However, me being the useless fucking cunt I am wasted all of it. I know I was so close to being in my dream college. I even got an admission offer but considering the disaster that will happen on my exam day I highly doubt that offer will hold. 

I’ll try my best to study. I will try my best to finish my curriculum, but if you ever read this. Mom, dad I am sorry! I don’t want to ever embarrass you! Sorry

Edit: I told my parents about my depression and my self harm. They just helped me calm down and just told me to do the best I can. All of us have come to terms with the fact that I might not do well. Even though I am not giving up I am also going with the reality of things. I feel like the burden has been off my shoulders. I still feel a little sad that despite coming this far I screwed up in the end and it will cost me my dream college, however, I still have a back up with comparatively lower conditionals. Thank you for your support. My exam is in two days ( on the 13th) shall keep you posted on how things turn out. Things are bad but I will figure something out.

Also, my parents and I have agreed that I should take therapy after my exams to deal with my mental health. 

Thank you guys for helping

when will i be treated seriously,"honestly, sometimes i'm seconds away from executing my suicide plan. mainly because i've been suicidal for more than 3 years, but there's another reason. i would have no trouble making an attempt knowing that it will fail, because ill be hospitalized. ill be cared for. they'll take me seriously and they will actually care. will i still be suicidal? probably. i just want a few hours of people taking me seriously. how can i prove to them that im struggling? seeing my cuts wasnt enough? should i just take it a step further?",t2_5sbcr3i9,2,0,0,"when will i be treated seriously honestly, sometimes i'm seconds away from executing my suicide plan. mainly because i've been suicidal for more than 3 years, but there's another reason. i would have no trouble making an attempt knowing that it will fail, because ill be hospitalized. ill be cared for. they'll take me seriously and they will actually care. will i still be suicidal? probably. i just want a few hours of people taking me seriously. how can i prove to them that im struggling? seeing my cuts wasnt enough? should i just take it a step further?"

"I feel doomed, should i?",I feel like im feeling everything a lot more intense than others. Even from a young age suicide was an option to me. It was weirdly comforting me. So i always used it to comfort myself. But these days i feel like sh*t is just really started to hit me. I just realized i started to really consider it and it feels weird. So i used to self harm but i never told anyone or anything and im currently on antidepressants but lately i tricked myself to another self harm method. I was tattooing myself at home with regular needles and it started to be routine of mine and then i realised i really dont care about what the tattoo is. I just feel pain comforting. Soni stopped but i feel really fragile and maybe i cant be saved? Maybe im doomed. Idk. I really think i should die?

I can't think of a good title,"Hello everybody. That night I'm feeling loneliest and sort of tired I guess. I'm not a social person and I try to avoid any social contacts. But that doesn't matter now. I just wanted to tell you my story. If that's allowed here.
I am an unwanted child. My parents have told me that. Many times.
I was born in a small town, where winter is warm and summer is extremely hot. Ordinary town, ordinary people. I was a happy child until the age of 11. Then it all started.
I was in the 5th grade. New school. New people. And unreasonable hate towards me, since the 1st day of being there. I was a friendly child, I tried to get along with everybody, but I guess there was still something wrong with me. I got beaten, my books torn, my shoes stolen, my clothes stepped on and ripped. I was even beaten by my teacher. Parents didn't care. All they said was ""Deal with it yourself. You're 11 already.""
So I dealt with it on my own.
I was trying to be as agressive as I can. And soon I was alone. Everybody thought I was crazy, but it was good for me, because I colid finally rest and not be afraid of being bullied again.
My classmates (and not only them) spread gossips about me, told everybody I'm a whore, drunkard, prostitute, lesbian, how ugly I am. I still don't even know why they did that.
But school wasn't the only place where I got molested.
My parents always told me how miserable, stupid, fat, ugly, short and smelly I am. They forced me to get good grades, even when I was almost breaking down. And when I won competitions, olympiades, they never cared. I was always a shame.
I wanted to be an artist. Since the day I saw my first anime. I knew I was going to be an artist. And that didn't happen. I was also interested in biology, so get a bachelor's degree in biology. And now my parents are angry at me. Because it's still not what they wanted. They can't get over the fact that I'm not a mathematics person. And I can't count very well. I can draw. But every piece of art is shit for them. They hate art and music. I honestly don't know if there's something they like.
They never let me do anything on my own, so now when I'm 18 and I'm trying to be independent, they just lose their shit.
I don't have close friends, and I don't have friends at all. I'm a shit-in basically, i hate myself so much there's no mirror in my room. I hate every inch of my body and I want a plastic surgery when I have enough money. I nearly stopped drawing. Because, I guess, it really doesn't make much sense after all.
Now I'm studying at the university. It's fun, teachers are good, I'm in a group with good people. But I think it's temporary. Everything will be bad in no time.
I tried to commit suicide around 5 times probably, but something always interrupted me and I made it out alive. That's not my full story of course. But I don't feel like finishing it now. As the ending, I wanted to say that the suicidal hotline told me I'm just whining. And I'm weak. And I'm annoying. Yes, shit is real. I honestly don't know why I wrote it. Probably it'll get deleted.

I just want a reprieve.,"I apologize for any lack of coherency on my part.

I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety from since I was really young. I’ve been diagnosed with a few other mental-health conditions that made life even more unnecessarily harder than it has to be, and sweet Christ, I just want this shit to be over. The only thing that has ever held me back from suicide is that—to me—it always felt like that would be the most selfish thing I could ever do. I think I have such a firm viewpoint on it because my mother has constantly tried to kill herself with no degree of real success but plenty of physical repercussions. There’s a long laundry-list of mental illness and abuse on both sides of the family and I’ve always thought that suicide was just an inevitability regardless of how hard I fought against it.

My homelife has always been abusive and toxic. When I was young I made a promise to myself that, if it never got any better by twenty, I’d just end it. By the time twenty rolled around, things had only deteriorated further, but I have a co-dependent best friend who I know would be totally destroyed if I went through with it. She’s told me many times that if I go she will follow me. It’s the thing I think of the most when my thoughts go dark, and hell, even when they’re not. I don’t think she realizes that she’s essentially made me responsible for her own reason to go living, so I fret over getting in some sort of freak accident if I go outside.

Outside of that, I’ve been in a relationship since my early high school days. It started as this tumultuous, blatantly toxic thing that we both sort of fell into. Since we were both hurt and needing, we just fumbled our way through it and damaged each other a lot along the way. Recently, we’ve finally made a breakthrough and it seems like our relationship will actually begin to be healthy, but it’s come at the cost of a lot. I endured some of the worst days of my life for over a month to try and make sure this relationship survived.

I lost the only person who was a real anchor in my life about eight years ago now and I’ve never been the same since. Though he was my grandfather, he was really my Dad in that he raised and was always a place of sanity in a family full of narcissistic monsters. I lost him the day after his birthday. He had just ordered some off-brand Nerf guns for us to have fun with—he also had really bad depression and had been laid-off from his job a few months back—and then I woke up to my grandmother screaming and him just laying dead against the wall. I grabbed his ankles and dragged him from the wall so that my grandmother could perform CPR. The paramedics made it and could not resuscitate him.

Shortly after that, my grandmother started sleeping around with men left and right, demanding that I work several jobs just to keep me out of the house. Even his funeral was a joke—my biological father breezed into town as he so often does at the worst times of my life to get drunk and make it all about himself.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going for other people. I haven’t ever really lived for myself. There’s never been any joy for me in existing, so I just strive forward for the people I care about, but I feel like there’s a void in me that just keeps eating away.

I just don’t know what to fucking do anymore.

Thanks for listening. I know this is really me screaming into the void more than anything else, but I am just so fucking lost right now.",t2_h24tt,2,0,0,"I just want a reprieve. I apologize for any lack of coherency on my part.

I grabbed his ankles and dragged him from the wall so that my grandmother could perform CPR. The paramedics made it and could not resuscitate him.

Shortly after that, my grandmother started sleeping around with men left and right, demanding that I work several jobs just to keep me out of the house. Even his funeral was a joke—my biological father breezed into town as he so often does at the worst times of my life to get drunk and make it all about himself.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going for other people. I haven’t ever really lived for myself. There’s never been any joy for me in existing, so I just strive forward for the people I care about, but I feel like there’s a void in me that just keeps eating away.

I just don’t know what to fucking do anymore.

Thanks for listening. I know this is really me screaming into the void more than anything else, but I am just so fucking lost right now."
Enjoying life ?,"Hello anyone,  
Right now I'm an engineering student but I can't find motivation to do anything. My assignments and tests are very demanding, I'm supposed to work a lot but I find myself shitty at everything, even if almost every person I know tells me I'm brilliant. I don't really know if I really want to become an engineer, and I have no real passion in my life or goal that I want to achieve more than anything. I sometimes find myself thinking that life itself is quite useless, we seek ways to distract ourselves and then we die. So why should I bother trying to live or find a hobby ?  
Please tell me what makes you get out of bed every morning and gives you the will to fight through any struggle that you may encounter.

Am I An Asshole For Wanting To Kill Myself?,"i can't work, i have crippling depression and back issues so no physical work for me. i like making youtube videos but after 3 years i haven't even hit 100 subs, i hate a lot of work and would rather die than work in retail. im young (17M) but i don't think that means i don't feel emotional pain?

i hate this damn world, everything sucks and the world is about to crash like in 2008 except like 10x worse lol.

i don't love anything the only thing i do is sit around and eat and watch anime.

Most people's lives will be so insignificant to everything else so why live?,"I'm struggling with life on an existential way, for 99.999999% other than the EXTREMELY successful, our entire existence will be forgotten within a generation after our death. We'll be but another statistic, nothing more than a number. I could try and work to be on that level of success, but even then my entire life I've been a borderline outcast, I'm so awkward and such a worthless human I've never really been fully excepted into a friend group, and even if I had the looks, personality and dedicated my life to being remembered, the odds are still incredibly against me, what are we supposed to do as a society? Look at the celebrities while knowing that will never happen to us, that is another human I'm looking at and looking at what their life is, has been and is yet to come and how they've been blessed with such a dream to have, and knowing personally, how much of a worthless piece of shit you will be, working a deadend job while watching my friends go out every night and having fun without inviting me a single time, I see how happy they are without me and when I'm with them they sort of have to put up with me, there's only a few friends I actually socialize with directly and I'm too awkward to with the others.

I don't understand the point of life, even people who aren't depressed battle with meaning. I know God isn't real, I know that from my social class and an absolute embarrassment of my genetics that my life won't be worth it, that isn't depression talking, that's from a rational viewpoint and I know it. That will be the same for virtually all of us, our lives are work, so we can afford to live - why?

So while we're here, it's like a very select few out of the billions get the privilege to live a life of huge fame, wealth and admiration from others. Then the majority live mediocre lives, life's okay and that's it. Then people like you and me, we're just born broken, whether that be genetics or how we are raised, we're just fucked.

Die from the skies by small plane,"So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

My mother will lead me to my death.,"Let me emphasize, I know that my mother has had a tough childhood and even adulthood. She’s been through a lot and during our argument I’ve stated that and said that I completely understand that her life has been “tougher” than mine. But because she’s an immigrant she thinks that my life in a better country is perfect and full of no problems. During my youth she’s kicked me out of the house for minimal things. The one that we just got into an argument about, just a few minutes ago, was whether the time she kicked me out of the house for not washing everyone’s dishes the day before my high school graduation. To clarify, I washed my own dishes as per our agreement. I just came home and I instantly did my own dishes. She then assumed that I was mad at her for not washing everyone’s dishes and just my own. I didn’t talk to her yet but she just assumed that I was mad cause I was doing my part of the agreement. Now she argues, after years after the incident, that washing everyone’s dishes is the “common sense” thing to do. Let me just say that this wasn’t the only time I’ve been kicked out. I’ve been kicked out for two weeks during Christmas twice because I wouldn’t plug the colour-coordinated plugs in the T.V. when she was standing right in front of it with all of my extended family members. You know the ones that literally has the same colours as the plugs they go into the T.V. None of my family members even helped me. I’m so done. I don’t want to be here anymore.

I'm Tired,"Pardon my grammar, english is not my first language. And I'm too tired to organize my thoughts

I'm 22 female. I do identify as a lesbian. I live in the Philippines if that helps. I am overweight, unhealthy, my salary is small but enough to keep me alive and contribute to the expenses/bills in our house (I live with my mom and grandma).

Work wise... I would say that I am quite unhappy. Stress has been piling up. I'm just honestly overwhelmed with the new responsibilities I have (I did accept those responsibilities but I wasn't informed/it wasn't stated that it would be massive, I was only told that the tasks would be minor). 

At home.. me being a lesbian is a taboo topic. Both my mom and grandma are hard core catholics. They are otherwise supportive. Sometimes they can be a little manipulative but its very minimal.

I have a history of these... Really low moments, where I entertain suicidal thoughts. Its been there ever since I was in 6th grade. I know the issues I've posted here might not seem like much but they're just the tip of the iceburg.

Anyways my main concern is:

I'm planning on ending my life in a couple of days. I've already written my letter.

I feel living in this system is living my life in vain.,"US citizen. You know how it is. Poor health coverage. Debt based education. Pitiful social security. Horrid politicians digging the middle and lower class our early graves.  

I've really been struggling lately with the fact that I have dreams and passions, but the 9-5 (or in my case 7 - 5:30) grind is stealing my will and my energy to do what I actually want to do. 

I've been seeking therapy for a year now. I had grief over a recent tragedy to cope with. I struggled for a bit to find some direction and bend my life into shape. 

I did that, but-

Now that I'm starting my path on a job I always thought I'd want - I realized that this isn't giving me pride or passion. I don't feel fulfilled doing this. I don't want to be at work right now as I type this. 

I'm so tired of waking up and forfeiting days of my life that I'll never get back, just to fill someone else's pockets. 

Time away from who I love and what I love to do - I'm sick of it. 

But that's the reality, and I feel such a desperate need to escape. I don't want to die. But I have the sinking suspicion that there's no other way to live in this era; live to work an ultimately meaningless job just for money.

But then you get four to five days out of the week that you just want to get over with. That you don't want to live through at all. 

And then you get what? 2 weeks off *maybe*, depending on the job? 
2 weeks of your life in exchange for an entire year wasted.

It's like I'm doomed to die an unfulfilled drone in the corporate machine.

Debt based education. Pitiful social security. Horrid politicians digging the middle and lower class our early graves.  

I've really been struggling lately with the fact that I have dreams and passions, but the 9-5 (or in my case 7 - 5:30) grind is stealing my will and my energy to do what I actually want to do. 

I've been seeking therapy for a year now. I had grief over a recent tragedy to cope with. I struggled for a bit to find some direction and bend my life into shape. 

I did that, but-

Now that I'm starting my path on a job I always thought I'd want - I realized that this isn't giving me pride or passion. I don't feel fulfilled doing this. I don't want to be at work right now as I type this. 

I'm so tired of waking up and forfeiting days of my life that I'll never get back, just to fill someone else's pockets. 

Time away from who I love and what I love to do - I'm sick of it. 

But that's the reality, and I feel such a desperate need to escape. I don't want to die. But I have the sinking suspicion that there's no other way to live in this era; live to work an ultimately meaningless job just for money.

Went for a medical and the nurse told my boss that I'm slitting my wrists and drinking pills even though I only mentioned that I wanted to gas myself 2 years ago.,"I'm an idiot, I know.

Kinda really don't like heights so my stupid ass was like ok cool less work for me. (Electrical apprentice btw) Nonchalantly she wrote it all up. Next day I hear my boss is scared of me jumping off the fucking scaffolding! And I haven't been suicidal in more than 6 months!

I’m done. There isn’t a future,"Mar 1: I quit drinking as agreed with my (now ex partner)

Tuesday I find the irrational anger and irritability hard to deal with, inform work, they’ve been through this (software dev, the addiction and suicide rate here is high, heck my desk is a dead by jumping teenagers desk)

Saturday I move to a hotel to give him space. It gets bad, I end up in ER for trying to jump from a travelodge window, tldr it’s impossible to squeeze through 

Now (ex I guess) partner has fucked off to a hotel as he tried to get a credit card to buy a spareroom but that didnt work. 

We both have issues, we generally deal together by writing and conversation and almost always we fix the issues

This isn’t that. This is I tried to better myself and it ended in a split that’s leaving me in a homeless state after March and a partner that just wants to better themselves

With 2.5 years to find him (I have certain kinks, I’m not at all vanilla and tried that route when desperate it just ended in more pain) I just don’t see where to go from here

i woke up the next morning to her text saying ""hey, are you alive?"" i replied ""yeah, too bad, thanks"" at that point i realized i should've turned off my phone right before i try to swallow the pills. a couple weeks after that have been normal, i gotta admit i had hope for a while, until i finally get back to campus, and now i'm starting see everything starts to falling apart again, and now i regret for not killing myself that night. looking back at it now, maybe i just don't have the guts to do it that night, that or any other reason that my mind can't even explain. now i'm planning to do it again, i still don't know when, or will i do it, but i really wanted to, thanks for reading this to the end.

A promise I made,"I have, for the past month and a half, been depressed for no discernable reason. Masturbating doesn't help, being with friends doesn't help. Food doesn't help, and my therapist no longer seems to help either. I actually had to cut our session short 10 minutes in last week because it was too much to be there.

It is now too much to be alive. I've dealt with suicidal tendencies in the past and have even attempted a few times... The last time I attempted, it was because the person that is my entire world lashed out and made me think he hated me... I was inconsolable. We had a very long conversation, where he apologized (though I made it clear that forgiveness wasn't going to be easy) and we talked about what we meant to one another. I told him I thought I had lost him forever, and he promised he'd never leave me without saying goodbye. That he'd always come back to me if he didn't say goodbye. I promised the same, which is where my problem lies. 

I want to die. Quite frankly I could do it right now with the pills in my cabinet, but I wouldn't be able to bring myself to swallow without letting him know I'm leaving. I simply can't have that conversation and it's so frustrating and damning to have that be the promise I can't help but stick to.

Kinda just need someone to talk too,"Hi, my name is Victor Hernandez, I'm a teenager and go to an average high school, I'm Hispanic so I have a Stereo typical Mexican family, where I'm supposed to be a ""man"" and stuff like that ,I wish I had someone to tell what I'm about to say but the truth is with my way of being I Accidentally pushed everyone away, all I have are 1 or 2 online friends and my parents which don't really support anything I do, to be honest with you i don't know if I actually want to end my life, it feels pointless to keep going but if I do end it what will it change? Life for everyone will go back to normal, but the thought of just ending it or running away never leaves my mind, I've tried many Methods to Relieve stress and bad thoughts like working out doing hobbies or making friends but all those things never go well for me, i creep everyone out even my teachers at times , probably cause I'm always tired or stressed out cause of school
I’m not really a Stereotype at a high school
I like Star Wars , comics but I’m fucking stuped 
I love to write but I’m really bad at it

Thank you",t2_5w7g5s7f,8,0,0,"Kinda just need someone to talk too Hi, my name is Victor Hernandez, I'm a teenager and go to an average high school, I'm Hispanic so I have a Stereo typical Mexican family, where I'm supposed to be a ""man"" and stuff like that ,I wish I had someone to tell what I'm about to say but the truth is with my way of being I Accidentally pushed everyone away, all I have are 1 or 2 online friends and my parents which don't really support anything I do, to be honest with you i don't know if I actually want to end my life, it feels pointless to keep going but if I do end it what will it change? Life for everyone will go back to normal, but the thought of just ending it or running away never leaves my mind, I've tried many Methods to Relieve stress and bad thoughts like working out doing hobbies or making friends but all those things never go well for me, i creep everyone out even my teachers at times , probably cause I'm always tired or stressed out cause of school
I’m not really a Stereotype at a high school
I like Star Wars , comics but I’m fucking stuped 
I love to write but I’m really bad at it

I'm tired of being here,"Im tired of hiding.  I've been wanting to kill myself since the age of 13. I have just gone through a traumatic experience and have no support besides family members throwing me in a mental hospital, calling the police on me and forcing/suggesting me to take medication and go to therapy (background: manipulative, controlling and narcissistic family that pretty much have dictated my whole life).

They're not a help at all and I really dont want them to be. I wish I had friends to talk to but due to being told all my life that ""family is the only one you have in life"" I took that literally as a child and did not know how to maintain relationships with my peers into my adulthood. I also was bullied and taunted when I was younger and held on to this for awhile.

I would write a longer rant but I'm shaking right now since my grandmother is calling people in the next room talking about my issues, saying she is helping but she really is not. I wish I can have the courage to just put a gun to my head or do something to just fucking disappear. 

To those who have friends and family who truly support you show graditude, be thankful. God has blessed you with that support. To those who are mentally strong I applaud you, for majority of people in this world aren't. For those who overcome obstacles and dont let anyone get in their way, despite the trauma they have endured all their life, wish I was like you.",t2_53gtzjxc,1,0,0,"I'm tired of being here Im tired of hiding.

i think my bestfriend killed himself.,"He's 18, and has been feeling really suicidal and down lately. I know him online, he lives in the states and I live in Canada.

I'm freaking out.

He sent a ""goodbye"" message in our group chat, with my one other friend and a minute after I immediately responded freaking out.

I hope I deserve to choose for myself,"I have suicidal thought from internal conflict or existential issue, mostly on religion topic. Being religious is hard for me. But being nonreligious is also harder. And if I die, I stake so many people's love n sincere feelings on me and I dont like that.

So I choose a stance for myself that likely to save me my life even if it's not a guarantee that after this I really be fine. But at least most probably. I prob never have a bold answer about whats the truth. 

Apart from whatever debate outside that makes my head n emotion hurt n confused, I need to have a faith (religion) and choose to it. Personally. And this is my personal choice. Don't shame me. I know the problem with religion and nonreligious too. But I cant sacrifice sanity over this irony. I dont want to hear it.

I wont say whats mine ofc. My point is I need to save my sanity. I dont know about all this existentialism shit. I agree life is miserable. But I cant make my family's like that too. Idk man. I choose whats need to be saved in urgence. I dont know. My life is miserable and I dont want to incite my suicidal thought with bothering this internal conflict.

All good (bad) things are 3?...,"How do I start? Well my life sucks. But not in the way like there are bad things and so, the general construct is so bad that I don't even see a reason to carry on. And it's funny. Because I heared from a lot of people who said they would swap with my life and so on. You could say the only good thing in my life is that I was born into a rich family so never really had to worry about money. But thats it.

I wasnt always like this. First 17 years of my life were nice, no doubt but after that it went downhill so rapidly. I lost some of my best friends, went more and more silent to the outside and idk, just became more and more depressed. The worst was how I saw people achieving so much stuff and I couldn't get done anything on my own. My friends had jobs, girlfriends and just pure joy to spend where I'm just a stupid, lonely and shy guy who no one even bothers to care about.

Now I'm 21 and got 2 suicide attempts behind me. After the first one I was just ruined for 2 months and then thought ""hey good that u didn't really kill yourself"". Then stuff got even worse with some important person in my life basically leaving me and attempt 2. And then I was so on the bottom that I still didn't get up from it. I did therapy and even the therapist had a hard time to show me something I should hold on to.

Yea and now I'm just on the verge of killing myself. I mean what do u have to loose. I don't wanna live in pain for the rest of my life and just suffer every day on. And the thing is, it won't change. So many people always told me that things will change. And maybe the circumstances or so but not who I am or what drives me or a thing like that. And I know that won't change because I was always like this. I made a list if I should kill myself or not and damn, the only contra thing I wrote was that maybe my parents would be sad about it but I don't care about that hard enough aswell I guess.

I honestly think I deserve to die.,"I’m in a really bad place right now. I don’t really want to kill myself because I know just how much it would damage people around me. I just want to get them to forget me. I want to fade into the back of people’s minds.

Never been this close to it before :(," 

I wrote a big fat post about how life wronged me bad. But I dunno. It’s amazing how the mind, free of its own volition and chemicals decides to scrap all that.

Hi. I’ve been suicidal for a while now. I have crippling mental health issues that just aren’t going away. My partner is getting exacerbated. She’s made an ultimatum. She’s also right. The ultimatum is both;

&amp;#x200B;

* Something I want to do, and,
* Something currently impossible to do.

My mind is telling me the only solution is to simply remove myself entirely from the scene. I have a terrible feeling if I die so will my partner. It’d be that way vice versa.

I’d like to just be done with it all. However… seeing that this is not a normal thought process. Surely all the cells in my body must want to survive? I’m gonna go to hospital. I don’t know what to expect just. I can’t carry on any more.

&amp;#x200B;

* Something I want to do, and,
* Something currently impossible to do.

My mind is telling me the only solution is to simply remove myself entirely from the scene. I have a terrible feeling if I die so will my partner. It’d be that way vice versa.

I’d like to just be done with it all. However… seeing that this is not a normal thought process. Surely all the cells in my body must want to survive? I’m gonna go to hospital. I don’t know what to expect just. I can’t carry on any more. Because right now suicide actually feels like a GOOD thought where once it was a BAD BUT NECESSARY one."

How do I tell my therapist I’m suicidal but not get sent to the hospital,"I need help for not just wanting to off myself after anything bad has happened. I’ve had the idea of killing myself since maybe 13. It brings me peace that I can just end it. My first attempt was at 15 I tried hanging myself but it hurt. I tried taking a bunch of pills oct 2018 but I woke up the next morning and felt like shit for about a week. Now I’ve put the gun up to my head but I was scared. I’m pretty close to doing it.

The thoughts of doing it are pretty much always there but I keep giving myself time. My bf has hid the gun but I know it’s always loaded. So if I really wanted to find it I could.

I see my therapist today I want to tell her the truth and see if she can help me but I know she will probably call the crisis team on me. She almost did about a month ago but I got scared and told her I didn’t feel that way at that moment. 

I’ve been in the hospital before and it was terrifying. Plus I have kids so when I was in the hospital they where watched by my mom and my bfs sister while he was at work.

What’s the fucking point,"I feel myself getting depressed again and I just don’t see the point of dealing with this shit again. Every time I start to feel better it’s just a waiting period before an even bigger wave of depression hits again and I just want to be done with this world. Every time I push through I’m only prolonging the inevitable and signing up myself for something harder. Only thing stopping me is I don’t want to have my friends as the ones who find me, soon as I find a way around that I’m fucking out. I honestly believe there’s nothing that will make me content and that I’m incapable of finding true peace. I feel like I’ve tried everything available to me and nothing works. Ive been a month sober from drugs and I was happier when I was fucking stoned all the time. The way I see it is I either go back to drugs and stay numb and alive or I just end this shit. I don’t feel like I’m good enough for anyone even when people tell me they love me I don’t believe it because I know me, I know I’m unlovable. For 12 years this constant depression has been my life.

this is a rant. i cant take this anymore god please,"i used to be so happy. I used to be excited for everything. I used to feel loved. the only thing i ever worried about was if i would be able to get home on time to watch my favourite show. 

But happy times always come to an end.

It all started when my parents divorced. My mom started going to work a lot, leaving me at my dad’s house. I wasn’t complaining though, i loved him so much. He took me to my favourite park almost everyday.

Seeing as we’re native, we were always pretty poor. But he did his best to make sure we felt happy. That we felt loved.

But one day, we (my sister and I) were dropped off at his house and he yelled at us and told us to go downstairs. 

So we did. He came down a while later and sat on the couch beside us while crying, telling us he’s sorry, that he loves us. He was crying and we just stared at the man who has been with us since birth not knowing what to do. Afterwards, he said he would bring us to the park the next day. An apology for yelling at us. We were happy, excited to have fun. We went on the rest of the day normally with the playground on our minds.

he killed himself the next day.

he hanged himself on a tree that i used to climb in the summertime. he hanged himself on a tree that’s been growing in the backyard since before we were born.

it’s been 8 years man. 8 fucking years why cant I forget him. everyone else moved on why the fuck cant i? i miss him so much i cant do this anymore, it’s too much. i want to hear his voice again, i want to hug him again, i want to go back in time but i know it’s not possible and it’s killing me.

i was 6 years old almost 7 i shouldn’t be missing him like this but i do and it’s so fuckinh painful

my chest physically hurts thinking about him and nobody knows.
i have no one to talk to anymore. my only best friend who has been with me through everything is gone. she’s gone and i put on an act everyday talking about her like we’re still friends in front of my mom because i dont want to look like a loner even though i am.

i feel like I’m walking on eggshells in this family, if i do something wrong they end up talking about me behind my back. i know they do because they do it with everyone else. i cant do anything without fearing someone might take it the wrong way.

three years ago, I found a journal my mom kept and I read it out of curiosity. there was an entry in that journal about everything that happened the day he committed suicide. he left a fucking video behind. he left a video behind on his computer and i have to live knowing that ill never see it. knowing that my mom lied to me saying he left nothing behind.

im feeling so desperate for death at this point, when will all this pain end?

i have no one to talk to. no one. i tried to talk to my mom but she’s always in a bad mood because of the constant family fights going on every single day. no one takes me seriously.

i cant do this, i don’t want to do this, im crying every night. full on bawling.

i want to die man, i want to die so bad. i even marked on the calendar the day when im gonna do it.

its less than a year away, im going to call the police first so my mom doesn’t find me then im going to hang myself

i cant even go to school anymore. every time i bump into who used to be my best friend, i feel a sharp stab in my chest and i go on the rest of the day feeling completely horrible. terrible.

I am nothing,"For some background-I had a really bad time with depression last school year. It was my first semester in college and it started off poorly (I got cut from marching band and my hamster died on the first real day of classes) and spiraled from there. So, I took a leave at home while taking classes at community college, and switched majors. Things were better-for a little. But now, I am failing 3 of my classes. I feel I cannot do anything right. I am fat, stupid, and alone. And to add insult to injury, everyone around me is thriving. My sister just got into a school that is comparable to an ivy league school (that I got rejected from), my high school classmate who goes to the same college as me just got elected student body president, my friend from band got accepted into marching band (I've auditioned twice and been rejected twice). I've talked to my mom about this, and even my therapist, and they all just tell me to ""stay in my lane"". But staying in my lane is impossible when I have no achievements and absolutely nothing to be proud of. I can only think of my recent failures-getting cut from band, failing the calc class I tried to take during my leave in community college, the fact that the classes I am taking now are going poorly, being fat and ugly, being single (for my whole life) and friendless, and failing a bunch of classes my first year in college. I constantly feel like I am the dumbest person in my major and everyone is better than me. 

Oh, and did I mention that my dad is an alcoholic, verbally abusive asshole, whose behavior has caused my family to fall apart? 

Also, I am probably never going to be able to work in a job I love (like art or writing) because those fields are incredibly competitive and I wouldn't make money. I can't take this bullshit anymore. I don't see a point in living a life I hate and looking forward to a future I will probably also hate. 

This is probably the part I'm most ashamed of. I constantly think about my funeral, and how maybe then, people would acknowledge me and say nice things about me (even if I wouldn't be there for it). Maybe my unrequited high school crush would even show up, who knows. 

I feel like I have enough reasons to end it all, at this point I am just looking for methods and giving myself a little time to sort things out before I go. I also need to figure out a way to do it without hurting my mom and siblings too badly. It would also be good if I could get over my paralyzing fear of death and the void of nonexistence so I can actually do something instead of just being miserable.",t2_50ubkmiq,5,0,0,"I am nothing For some background-I had a really bad time with depression last school year.

i wanna die or stop existing,"it’s been years since i feel shit, i started to feel like a worthless person since i started highschool, i didn’t want to go to the school that my mom wanted to, but i can’t do anything people started to dragged me down every single time they had a chance, as the school year was ending i read a post that was posted by my classmates on our group, that really tore me down. i convinced my dad that i didn’t want to go to that school i want to be with my old friends, but it was not a happy start people around me made fun about my appearances including my friends who i trusted the most, my mom will ridicule me in front of other people and she wouldn’t stop for hours. i was holding my tears the whole time and my mom didn’t care about my feelings all along, i worked hard to be successful one day, but she told me that i can’t do it, you’ll end up failing, but at that time i didn’t stop i still worked my ass off, so that i could succeed someday, but my mom has always some bad things to say about me, and i can’t really take it anymore. i worked very hard and didn’t give up that time, but they failed my grades for a foolish reason, that’s why i didn’t have the confidence to take my dream job. most of my teachers will say that i could not succeed in anything because i’m not capable to do anything. so i end up taking the lowest qualifications on my course so that i could go to college, as i finished enrolling on my college i stayed up all night to think about my decision so i decided to tell my mom that i want to withdraw my enrollment and enroll on a different course, but she said no. that made me feel like shit when my mom was talking to my dad mocking about my appearance and i was crying all day. as we were having an ojt on the summer i didn’t feel happy at all, i was doing something that doesn’t thrill me, so i cried in front of my mom begging that i want to change courses because i was unhappy, but she said no because it was my fault that i choose it in the first place, so i acknowledged it, i didn’t mention that in the last 3 years. but when i was having an ojt far away from home, my friends would make me feel bad,blamed me for something i didn’t do. they stole my money and they were making me think that i was delusional. that really strained my emotional quotient that time, as i moved to my next ojt after my ojt that i was home away, the one who has been supervising me told a very bad thing it wasn’t real and that was the reason for my expulsion on my ojt. but i moved forward to complete my remaining days. but one day as i was making our thesis i was chosen to be the leader of my group, everytime when i came home my mom would say unnecessary things that really dragged me down, and she was making me unmotivated about my thesis every moment that she has, but i continued my thesis, and it was completed, while we were presenting my group mates didn’t cooperate to make our presentation successful, i told them that it was their turn to present but they stayed quiet, so i was the only one who was giving a presentation, so that made the jury really mad so they decided to fail us. i had a breakdown and i came home as usual and i was wiping my tears and i was holding it back so that they wouldn’t notice but my mom would say toxic things that i shouldn’t have worked that hard.the next day, i was really exhausted and i ended up waking at 1PM because i didn’t have a sleep for two days. that’s when i received a text message that said that i didn’t cooperate and i was slacking off on the group and it was my fault that my group failed, that moment i was feeling numb and want to die. i decided to go to a therapist but it didn’t helped. i was taking some meds and at that time i was empty inside and i was feeling a lot of anxiety all around me, i isolated myself for a 3 months. then they continued our thesis on our own, but whenever i go to my school i couldn’t stopped myself imaging the angry glares around me, my friends in college are not supportive either. so i go through the hardships and finished my college. a lot of life changing moments have been getting into my life since i graduated college a year ago, i don’t want to write further more, but it seems that i don’t want to exist anymore, i’m literally disgusted with myself everytime i look in the mirror. i just want to

about my feelings all along, i worked hard to be successful one day, but she told me that i can’t do it, you’ll end up failing, but at that time i didn’t stop i still worked my ass off, so that i could succeed someday, but my mom has always some bad things to say about me, and i can’t really take it anymore. i worked very hard and didn’t give up that time, but they failed my grades for a foolish reason, that’s why i didn’t have the confidence to take my dream job. most of my teachers will say that i could not succeed in anything because i’m not capable to do anything. so i end up taking the lowest qualifications on my course so that i could go to college, as i finished enrolling on my college i stayed up all night to think about my decision so i decided to tell my mom that i want to withdraw my enrollment and enroll on a different course, but she said no. that made me feel like shit when my mom was talking to my dad mocking about my appearance and i was crying all day. as we were having an ojt on the summer i didn’t feel happy at all, i was doing something that doesn’t thrill me, so i cried in front of my mom begging that i want to change courses because i was unhappy, but she said no because it was my fault that i choose it in the first place, so i acknowledged it, i didn’t mention that in the last 3 years. but when i was having an ojt far away from home, my friends would make me feel bad,blamed me for something i didn’t do. they stole my money and they were making me think that i was delusional. that really strained my emotional quotient that time, as i moved to my next ojt after my ojt that i was home away, the one who has been supervising me told a very bad thing it wasn’t real and that was the reason for my expulsion on my ojt. but i moved forward to complete my remaining days. but one day as i was making our thesis i was chosen to be the leader of my group, everytime when i came home my mom would say unnecessary things that really dragged me down, and she was making me unmotivated about my thesis every moment that she has, but i continued my thesis, and it was completed, while we were presenting my group mates didn’t cooperate to make our presentation successful, i told them that it was their turn to present but they stayed quiet, so i was the only one who was giving a presentation, so that made the jury really mad so they decided to fail us. i had a breakdown and i came home as usual and i was wiping my tears and i was holding it back so that they wouldn’t notice but my mom would say toxic things that i shouldn’t have worked that hard.the next day, i was really exhausted and i ended up waking at 1PM because i didn’t have a sleep for two days. that’s when i received a text message that said that i didn’t cooperate and i was slacking off on the group and it was my fault that my group failed, that moment i was feeling numb and want to die. i decided to go to a therapist but it didn’t helped. i was taking some meds and at that time i was empty inside and i was feeling a lot of anxiety all around me, i isolated myself for a 3 months. then they continued our thesis on our own, but whenever i go to my school i couldn’t stopped myself imaging the angry glares around me, my friends in college are not supportive either. so i go through the hardships and finished my college. a lot of life changing moments have been getting into my life since i graduated college a year ago, i don’t want to write further more, but it seems that i don’t want to exist anymore, i’m literally disgusted with myself everytime i look in the mirror. i just want to end my life."

I don't understand myself,"I don't know if this will sound nonsense to some people, but I guess I don't even care anymore. I just think I need to tell someone at some point, instead of just keeping those things to myself my whole life. Idk, maybe it's even pretty common (I hope it is).

I firmly believe that I have some kind of brain defect or something like that. When I was a kid, I remember being a weirdo. I went into places and felt their ""aura"" right away. Some of them were very pleasant, like a piece of heaven on Earth, while others made me feel really uncomfortable. It was kinda like being in a ""dreamy"" state of mind 24/7... like a fantasy world I built for myself, right on top of what is known as ""reality"". When my art teacher showed me ""The Starry Night"" by Van Gogh, I immediately felt like it was hitting really close to home; I could be wrong, but I really believe he (Van Gogh) was trying to translate the ""aura"" he got from that specific place he painted, to the picture itself. Now, I'm no visual artist like Van Gogh of course, I can't even draw tbh, but it just felt as if we'd both understand each other very well (emotionally at least), should we meet somehow.

As I got older, these feelings slowly went away, specially since I'm really bad with words, and can't quite explain to people how I'm feeling sometimes, so I kinda put them aside for the sake of properly communicating with people. I thought everyone hated it when I started talking about those weird feelings I had, so I kinda pretended I was better off without them, up until the point I even forgot about them completely.

But something happened to me, and in a matter of days, I suddenly started remembering everything, and who I was, and who I want to be in life. Like I said, I'm really bad with words, and it feels PAINFUL just to write this post right now. It feels like I'm trying harder than I should. But the fact is, even though I lost those feelings for a while, I don't want them to ever go away. I don't want to ever forget how I used to go into places and suddenly feel like everything was being slowed down to perfection. I don't ever want to forget about how music feels, and about how it wraps me in a piece of heaven every time I listen to it.

If I'm dead the initial pain will hurt people but they'll get over it, they won't have to watch me fade away over a long period of time"

I think the only reason why I'm not actually killing myself is because I'm scared to do it.,"I'm so lost, so many times during the past couple of months I've went to bed drunk or high early in the afternoon hoping that I will not wake up in the morning. But the last couple of days I've been googling stuff about suicide.

The funny thing is that most people I know keep telling me how amazing my life is. I also happen to have a mildly big social media presence because of my job and keep getting messages by random people saying how much they envy me. If only they knew. I hate myself. I feel like a waste of energy, time and money to everyone that's around me, even my mother (other than my grandmother she's pretty much my whole family). I can't talk to my friends about any of that, I feel like they will either don't believe me or be so embarrassed about me that will just completely abandon me.

And then of course my heart gets broken... I met this girl a couple years ago, a girl that never in a million years should even be in the same room as me. We start spending almost all of our days together, we get super close, I travel around the world to find her, she does the same a couple of times. I tell her how much I love her, how all I really want is to be with her. She feels the same but we're in a weird industry, it doesn't make sense since literally half of the year she's just flying to another random city, she doesn't want to be in a relationship. So we just keep going, doing the same. Somehow seeing other people at the same time but I never really enjoy doing that, it just makes me hate myself even more. She goes away once again, we get closer than ever during that time and when she's back I'm almost certain that we're going to be a couple but also don't want to push anything. So we start spending all our time together again.

Then suddenly couple of weeks ago she starts getting a bit distant. I only see her once a week for 3 weeks in a row... I'm starting to go crazy and at that point I think she's actually falling for someone else. I talked to her about it and she said that it's the same as usual, we always see other people and at this point she's just too busy and stressed and wants to be more friends than 'more than friends' for the time being. But every day we don't spend together and she's with someone else my heard breaks into a million pieces, I get more and more certain that she's slowly fading away. It could all be in my head. I also know that none of this is healthy at all but before I met her I was at a very dark place, for the whole time I've known her she has been my only source of happiness. I think I'm about to lose her and the thought alone makes me want to somehow disappear into nothingness so I can't feel or think anything anymore.

At the end of the day I don't think I'm capable of hurting myself, I'm too scared to do that. And as I'm typing this I feel like I'm wasting the time of people who come here to help others with way more serious issues than mine... but damn I wish I won't wake up tomorrow.",t2_5w64w1qb,4,0,0,"I think the only reason why I'm not actually killing myself is because I'm scared to do it.

Draft-suicide note,"For the world to know:

Its finally come to this, hasn't it?

My parents are probably going to be confused, as I'm the ""perfect child"" and all. The one with all A's, the funny, sarcastic one... 
I feel kind of bad, but I better explain myself
First things first... dont give me a funeral. They're too expensive and even so, I dont want my death noticed like that. Maybe I want to be noticed and remember, but you'd all just embarrass me at a funeral.

I've got my own reasons for doing this.
I think the most obvious is being an atheist in a crazy mormon family. It makes me want to shoot myself being forced into this. I guess the church isn't all that bad, they do a lot of charity work...its the lack of free will and the whole ideology that you cant transition because it's a sin is hurtful. I dont believe in an afterlife...these 13 years are all I've got...and yet I'm in so much pain that I'm willing to throw it all away. That says something.

People say I'm smart because of how self aware I am. I'm aware of exactly how this may turn out for other people. It's weird.

Another reason is that I'm trans. Some people know this. My dysphoria makes me want to die. I'm forced to watch my body betray me and watch as everything that I know crumbles as I realise that what I am is what I'm not. But I'm too young to know, obviously, and I'm just going to be added to the suicide statistic of trannies who have killed themselves.

One thing that I wish from people is that I'm not forgotten. My name, Adrian Leeroy, wont be spoken after I'm gone. Maybe my dead name will be, which is Madison, but that name makes me dysphoric. Its depressing knowing that all of my experiences, friendships, relationships, emotions, stories, ideas, achievments...they all die with me. They wont be remembered. I won't be remembered. So please, somebody please do something to at least keep my existence out there. Mention my insta, give me a grave, I dont care. I just cant bear the thought of all of this being forgotten.

I have so many stories and ideas and emotional connections, but I guess they go down with me. I have some of my ideas written down in notebooks...some are at my dads, under my bed.

Please don't throw my ideas, my art, or my stuff away. Please dont sell them. I want my objects to still exist to help remember me, if that makes sense. And please dont use my consoles, I guess. I like the idea of them laying dormant, waiting for an owner that will never return... it's weird, but it feels right.

Speaking of, I leave [fatherly figure] my console's, phone, art, stories, etc. He deserves it. Hes helped me a lot with my issues and I'm sorry that he couldn't prevent it.
Also, [bestfriend] can take whatever he wants. Hes done likewise.
My little brother can have my books, I guess.

Some people might think that they could've done more to help me. If you've joked insultingly to me, you haven't affected me. I can take a joke, lots of people know this. If you've been downright mean to me, you can put some blame on your shoulders. I feel bad about that, because I shouldn't have an impact like that...that would be selfish of me to put my burdens on another's shoulders...

Dear my parents, I'm sorry. You guys have controlled me and been anti trans, anti me, your whole life. Dont get too down on yourself, but I feel terrible to inform you that...yeah, you caused some of this...

It's okay to joke about this. You dont have to take me seriously. Joke all you want about how all trans people kill themselves or about how dumb I am or whatever.

Honestly, I kind of did this to prove myself. I can tell that people think that I'm an attention seeker. Some people want me dead anyways. So here's my proof.

I'm also trying to stop the flow of time for me. Right now, my life is decent (which is somewhat ironic). I want it to stay that way. Nobody that I love is gone and I'm still in a school with a mostly great student body. I don't want that to change. I'm scared of the future. So I'm glad to just kind of stop here.

I wonder what the school will do...will they have an assembly? Will they just announce me on the intercom and be done with it? I dont know. I dont care. Just dont forget me.

Dont forget me but make sure to move on, too. Dont dwell on me.

Its sad...I wont be able to feel the sun on my skin, I wont be able to smell the smell of right after rain, I wont be able to taste sweet chocolate, I won't be able to beat that one room in Celeste that was bothering me, I wont be able to listen to Kurianes beautiful music anymore, I wont reach the day where my art looks good to me, I wont see the day where I get 1k updoots , I wont see how my favorite Webtoon ends, I wont see my dogs beautiful eyes and for glisten in the sunlight, and I'll miss out on so many fun little parts of life... but it's worth it, I guess...

I dont want any boomers blaming this on social media, by the way. This has nothing to do with social media. Dont go there.

I'm scared,"I'm losing more in life than I'm winning. 

It's hard to keep getting back up after being knocked down so much. Especially when you're knocked down by the people you love. 

I figured out my dream job, after several years of not being confident in mediocre jobs I had planned to go for. I want to be a mortician. Not because it's fun, or I think it'll be cool - I have depression. I have a morbid view on life. Death doesn't scare me because it walks by my side everyday, waiting for me to give in and fall into its arms. I want to help others with their losses. Prepare the deceased, to give them a proper goodbye, and lay them to rest. 

It's not a pretty job. But it's pretty important. 

My boyfriend thinks it's weird. He's grown more comfortable with it, but the thought of him not being proud of me and considering me a freak hurts my heart, just a little. 

I told my dad about my career change tonight, so damn hopeful he'd be proud I figured my shit out and was going for a well-paid career. 

He told me I could never do it. That I'm a woman, that I'm not mentally and physically and emotionally strong enough. That I'm not smart enough for the education. That I can't handle owning my own business. That I should reconsider and pick a real job. 

I feel like I'm losing. Every god damn battle and obstacle. People are pushing me flat on my face and no one is helping me up. They walk over me when I'm done and no one cares. 

Why should I keep going on? Why should I try and live? What is the point if I constantly feel like I'm a failure? Why do I always feel like I shouldn't try to be alive? Why shouldn't I just give up and stop trying to live a life I don't deserve and could probably never maintain?

Sitting here trying to talk myself out of killing myself but I can’t find a reason to stay alive anymore.,"I’ve been acting like everything is ok. I’ve been trying to act normal. Been going to work, been doing gigs on the side, watching tv shows.. pretending like everything is ok. 

I’m good one minute. Terrible the next but I can’t fucking take it anymore. I had posted a while ago that I was raped and only found out when I found out I was pregnant. I don’t have a problem with what other women do with their bodies but I didn’t think I could handle having an abortion. I just cried and cried for days because I did t want to have an abortion but I knew I’d resent the child not just about being born but I ducking live in my car.. how the hell was i supposed to have a child and then idk if it’s cause I don’t eat or the stress or maybe my body is just not ready for a child but I had a miscarriage.. and then I thought it was a sign from God. I thought that it might be a blessing and that he was watching out for me.. Having a miscarriage sucks but having it when you’re homeless and living in your car when you don’t have direct access to bathroom is even harder yet I didn’t care because I felt relieved and then guilt set in.. how could I be glad about having a miscarriage? Why would God do that as a good thing.. then I questioned if God was even real and if he wasn’t then there was really no point in being alive. And then I talked myself out of it. I thought things could get better.. people here on reddit were so nice and caring and I thought maybe just maybe I’d be ok.. 

I went back to pretendint everything was fine.. Working to get out  of my situation but every single time I felt like I was saving up, my grandma would get sick and there went my money. I feel like no matter what I do I’m never getting out.

I just miss my parents.. I want someone to just love me and be there for me and then I feel responsible because maybe if I would’ve taken care of myself, I wouldn’t have had a miscarriage and then I’d have someone that loves me unconditionally. Everyone I’ve ever been there for has used me up and then thrown me away but maybe that child wouldn’t have. 

And then I tell myself people have it worse and it makes me try for a day or two but then out of no where I’ll go back to feeling this way and then I’ll snap out of it.. but not this time. 

My rapist came up with the money and was bonded out this morning. No one even bothered to tell me until an hour ago. I stupidly went on his Instagram to see if une posted anything and his friends are tagging him in pictures. They fucking threw him a welcome party.. a rapist gets that... meanwhile here I am alone in my fucking car trying to talk myself out of killing myself. 

Idk what I did to have this life? The only thing keeping me alive is that my grandma would be homeless but then I wonder if maybe she’ll find her way out. Idk I just don’t want to be alive anymore.

Help me. Please,"I don’t know what to do, and I’m really fucking scared.

Background:

I’m a 15 year old guy, with an estranged abusive father and an overbearing, manipulative, yet somewhat supportive mother. I have two older sisters who I struggle trusting because everything I say to them gets repeated back to my mother. My older brother (essentially my best friend even though we fought as brothers do) hung himself when I was 11 and I still see him in that position to this day, when I and my mother found him. I live only with my mum and have had a fairly bad mental state and have been teetering on the edge a bit, due to an oppressive school, stress, insecurities, circumstances, and my sexuality. (See post history). I refuse to see a counsellor as I have before and that’s just not how I like dealing with my emotions

This post isn’t about me though.

My first cousin, who was really close to my older brother and me, recently tried to commit suicide by driving off of a cliff. I only see him once/twice a year but we get along really well, and have really good conversations. I don’t really get along with any of my family on my father’s side but he’s different. 

I heard about it about 2 hours ago from my Grandmother. I don’t like how she told us behind his back because I know how that feels but I understand that she’s just worried. I need advice on how to show support for him. I really care about him, but I don’t want to make him feel like he’s only loved when he’s trying to commit suicide if you know what I mean. We live about an hour away from each other, and I can’t drive so I’ve considered catching a train to see him but I don’t know if that’s a good idea. He’s not seeking professional help yet either. 

Please give me advice.

Please",t2_46kc9e59,1,0,0,"Help me. Please I don’t know what to do, and I’m really fucking scared.

I have two older sisters who I struggle trusting because everything I say to them gets repeated back to my mother. My older brother (essentially my best friend even though we fought as brothers do) hung himself when I was 11 and I still see him in that position to this day, when I and my mother found him. I live only with my mum and have had a fairly bad mental state and have been teetering on the edge a bit, due to an oppressive school, stress, insecurities, circumstances, and my sexuality. (See post history). I refuse to see a counsellor as I have before and that’s just not how I like dealing with my emotions

This post isn’t about me though.

My first cousin, who was really close to my older brother and me, recently tried to commit suicide by driving off of a cliff. I only see him once/twice a year but we get along really well, and have really good conversations. I don’t really get along with any of my family on my father’s side but he’s different. 

I heard about it about 2 hours ago from my Grandmother. I don’t like how she told us behind his back because I know how that feels but I understand that she’s just worried. I need advice on how to show support for him. I really care about him, but I don’t want to make him feel like he’s only loved when he’s trying to commit suicide if you know what I mean. We live about an hour away from each other, and I can’t drive so I’ve considered catching a train to see him but I don’t know if that’s a good idea. He’s not seeking professional help yet either. 

Please give me advice.

Please"

I have a plan but I wanna know if it gets better,"I really don't know why I'm posting this here. But anyway.

The reason I'm gonna kill myself is because I keep hurting the people I love and who love me. There's this one person who really unconditionally loves me but I hurt that person anyway because of my own insecurities and mental bullshit going on.

The thing is, I've tried to be better. I did my best to change myself, to be mindful of my reactions, but when it actually counts, I keep disappointing myself and others. I keep hurting them. And I keep apologising and saying I'll do better, but I never do. And it all feels out of my control because once that part of my mind takes over, all rational thought is gone.

I'm just tired. I'm tired of trying and failing. I'm tired of hurting others while I'm trying to change myself for the better because yes, we all make mistakes, but there are unforgivable ones. Ones we can't take back. And sometimes it happens even when we're trying our best to be better.

I don't think I'll ever be okay. I can try to, but there will always be another fight, another incident, that will end up in me hurting others, and it's gonna be the same conversation and apology.

People are gonna get tired of it, too. I know for sure. Even the ones who love me unconditionally will get tired of it. I know because it already happened.

To stop all this, maybe this is the answer. Ending it all. I have no other reason to live. I may have a good career path and a nice financial future (I'm graduating this year), but what's the point in all that if I don't have anyone to live for? And even if I did, what's the point if all I do is inevitably hurt them? I can't live for myself because I'm tired of dealing with my own bullshit. It's easier this way.

Btw, therapists and the like aren't very accessible in my country. I dont have the same resources most of you do, so if you do, please take the opportunity and get help. All this time I only have myself and Internet resources to try and help me, and that's all I can have.

So there. I wanna get it out there that I have a plan. I'm jumping off my high rise apartment on Saturday once all my roommates go home for the weekend. I live on the 15th floor so it's a surefire way to die. I'm currently preparing my documents, bank accounts, social accounts. I've had suicidal thoughts before but today, I've never felt calmer thinking about this plan.",t2_qcwqf,2,0,0,"I have a plan but I wanna know if it gets better I really don't know why I'm posting this here.

I'm still here.. I wish I wasn't.,"I'm still here. I'm still alive, unfortunately. Everyone here seems so nice and caring. Wish my real friends were like that. Well, only two are. But, sometimes I'm so stubborn I feel like even their input isnt enough to keep my mindset off of suicide. 

I've had problems with a past ex-boyfriend for the last 2 years. And today, I lost my job. I seem to lose things a lot. And don't know what to do about it. My depression is so bad I feel like its slowly going to win. I've thought about how I could end my life. But, I don't know how. At least the pain would be better than what I feel now. 

This is going to get gruesome. But, I was thinking of just slitting my throat and letting myself bleed out and suffocate. Life isn't for me. It's not. It hates me. Just like everyone else in my life, except maybe those two friends and my family. But, again.. I'm stubborn. And I don't care how they feel. 

Maybe that makes me a selfish asshole as well, but, I'm tired. I love someone who hates me. Who thinks I'm a psycho and thinks I'm a stalker. Maybe I sort of am. But, I just wanted honesty. And... I didn't get that. I got lies and I got replaced. And no by one. By *many* women. It hurts. 

Losing my job made me feel like a failure. But, he fed my depression and my suicidal thoughts. I won't go into detail about the things my ex has said and done to me. Of course, he's never physically abused me. I'm glad for that. No, what he did was 10000x ***worse*** he mentally, emotionally, and verbally abused me. As well as I have done to him. 

*I'm no saint.* I know this. All I ever wanted was true love from him. And to be married. To have a family. I wanted that when I was with him. He didn't. It's been a ***year*** since we've been broken up. And I'm still in pain, and even worse pain knowing that he wants marriage and a family now that we aren't together. 

I know people will say ""maybe you weren't his one. Or he wasn't yours."" I believe we weren't meant to be. And I know you can't force things. But, I truly loved him. And I still do. When I wished that I didn't.

I'm still here, though. I don't want to be. And I've been going by this motto I made up myself..

Fuck I think this really is the end.,"I have a concrete plan. I have numerous suicide notes which I will leave all on my phone and print one concise version where I just tell everyone I love them. I wanted to make videos of myself thanking people but that felt kinda morbid and I don’t have any other videos of me so I wouldn’t want people to remember me by watching suicide note videos. So it’s just gonna be a piece of paper. 

Method: Hanging deep in the woods with an adult diape. Because any other way is just either not guaranteed or too macabre or will harm others. I will be wearing an adult diaper and a hoodie that wraps my head.  I will have on me my ID, my bracelet, the little elephant toy and the note. It will take place in the evening when I usually take my dog for a walk. I will choose a day when it doesn’t rain and isn’t too cold. It started getting warmer now so I think wearing thermal underwear will make it warm enough. My dog will stay at home and will be taken care of.

I’m scared. But I’m so close now. Finally. There is no way I can live a life worth living without being in or causing others pain. This is the only option. Everyone will be relieved. Of their pain.

I hate money. I hope coronavirus kills me.,"Honestly. I'm in so much debt because my ex used my name for things, I have no friends and now I'm way too scared to make new friends because she told the few people in my life to begin with I abused her when I didn't and no one bothered to fact check with her or me and just believed her, I was molested as a child and bullied most of my life, I'm just convinced that what everyone said about me being ugly and stupid must be true because I sure haven't heard many people say I'm smart or handsome. I just don't stand a chance in this society (US society specifically).


I waste money my family doesn't have for extra food and gas, we have finally gotten out of homelessness after 10+ years and we are so close to going back to being homeless it isn't right. It hasn't even been a year since we got out of it. If I wasn't around things would be better. I can't save any money because I spend it all helping them with rent and stuff because I suck up their income with needing food and them to drive me to work every day, I can't even spend it on the debt I have because I make minimum wage even though I have certain specific knowledge, skills and years experience yet no one wants to hire me. I work 6-7 days a week and still don't make enough to save. I don't have friends so I don't go out. I distance myself from my co-workers on purpose like an idiot because even though they are nice I am so scared of making friends and then them just betraying me like when my ex told them a lie and they believed her as well as so many other instances in the past. I don't smoke/vape or drink at all, I wouldn't know the first thing about how or where to get drugs either so it's not like I'm spending money or time on random stuff like that. I spend most of my free time sleeping hoping I don't wake up.


The only thing I look forward to is seeing my current girlfriend. She's the only friend that stuck around and come to find she had liked me a very long time and believed me over my ex. I don't know why she likes me and I liked her too but didn't think she liked me so I stupidly dated someone abusive and manipulative instead, but I am happy that someone like her loves me. I love her so much but I know I am a burden to her. I have bad credit from my ex using my name for some bills without telling me when we were together and such. I don't see how anyone can afford a house here in America unless they are making something like 70-80k+ with flawless credit and I can't even make 25k and can't get a better job because no one wants to hire me even though I have the knowledge to work in a specific field where I could be making 40-50k at least. I don't have a car and can't save for one and don't have money to renew my license anyways. If I could live in a different country like in Scandinavia or something I would but traveling and making enough money and finding the time to somehow gain citizenship sounds very expensive also.

I work somewhere where there are thousands of people that pass through daily, I hope I catch the coronavirus and die. I can't own a gun and kill myself, but if I could things would be better for everyone. My family might be sad for a bit but they won't be spending unnecessary money on me and be homeless. My girlfriend is smart, kind and amazing and is able to go places. I would never do anything to hurt her, and while I know my death would sadden her deeply I feel as though I have nothing to offer her. I can only give her my love and happiness, I can't help us get and afford a home or afford food or do anything for long term security so we can live happily and safely. Not to say it's all up to me because she would be doing what she could for me too, but for where I am and always have been in life no matter how hard I try to do anything to change it I would just be an expense to her that can't give her my 50% to making sure our future is secure. We've talked about having kids in the future and in my head I know that if we did I would just be a let down to them... I couldn't offer them the happy future they deserve, especially in this world where it's okay to destroy the climate for a bit of profit and eventually make the world uninhabitable anyways. The last thing I want is for her (and if we had kids) to be homeless with no hope for the future too. This whole world runs on stupid money, I honestly hate the concept of money and wish we could run the world off trade and knowledge or something. It's one of the biggest issues I have with being alive. 


TL;DR-
I hate being alive I hope coronavirus kills me. I have no friends and I'm generally unlikeable and just a burden to the few people in my life.

The notion of gender INequality often leads me to suicide.,"I'm not from North America, but from a relatively more conservative country, so the context may be different.  I would like to remain gender neutral in this post to protect myself and so that the post benefits everyone.  I'd also like to make my position clear.  I'm a feminist and misanthrope, so in a nutshell I hold certain cynical/pessimistic opinions about everyone equally and I want equality for everyone.  My opinions do not skew towards certain demographics, hence I am not a misogynist, misandrist, incel, femcel, or a bigot.

I often go down this particular rabbit hole of thought when a notion of gender inequality that is perceivably severe, applies to me, and hurts me, comes up.  Either I read/hear about it or my brain just induces it.  It just hits me really personally.  The notion leads to crippling stress and self-hate, especially towards my biological sex.  I would occasionally be unable to concentrate for an entire day, which affects my work and studies.  I would sometimes go into a panic attack.  I would constantly go over with myself: ""I hate my biological sex, I wish I were the opposite sex, being the opposite sex would have made my life better in this regard, why was I born as this biological sex?, why was I even born?, I/my existence/my biological sex is wrong.""  Which leads to depression and anxiety, like self-hate, and ""am I even doing anything right?, why do I deserve this life?, I'm worthless, nobody loves/cares about me.""  I once cried in bed and the shower because of all this and wishing I was the opposite sex.  Which then ultimately leads to self-harm and suicidal ideation.  I once planned my suicide months in advance in case I wanted to quickly escape from this reality, but I never used it.  Obviously, it has left me with trauma that still accumulates, and a numb feeling when it comes to anything I used to enjoy.

I constantly feel this way, but I've only recently found a few ways to cope, and I'm just slowly getting used to the pain.  For example, I have gone on a gender role strike, in that I refuse to do anything stereotyped to my biological sex because I hate my biological sex and don't want anyone to pursue me based on that, and refuse to do anything stereotyped to the opposite sex because it feels like something exclusive and I just don't feel like the opposite sex.  It makes me feel better, but it also means I'm hardly doing anything that isn't perceived as gender-neutral.  I also think I'm transgender.  I have gender dysphoria, but unlike trans people whose dysphoria is biological, mine seems to come from trauma and personal experiences, like I believe I was born in the wrong body not because of a mismatch between my brain and body, but because ""I was born in the wrong body because it's wrong to have this kind of body according to myself and society.""  I enjoy trans memes and hanging out with the community.  I get euphoria from feeling, looking, and acting stereotypically like the opposite sex.  I also relate to the typical experiences of being transgender, like relating to the opposite gender more, wanting to fit in with them, etc.  I get jealous of the opposite gender too.

What's worse is I have no-one close I feel comfortable talking about this to.  I found that both women and men generally just continue to live their lives, embracing their birth identity, and thinking such inequality is trivial.  Gender essentialism is very rampant here.  I have been abused, physically, emotionally, and sexually, by both women and men, and I just feel like nobody cares about me or my struggles, let alone equal rights.  When I brought these issues up to my mum, she thought I was overreacting about something ""so trivial.""  Everyone just seems to trivialise issues I think are severe, and nobody's really speaking up.  And I don't know if moving to another country that has more gender equality will help me with these issues, as people will see me as a human being with ambitions and feelings rather than a walking genital, and people won't take advantage of me based on something I cannot control, like my biological sex.

I am scared of the negative way I think and want to be admitted to a mental Institution.,"To start off, while I think it is important to admit I am drunk writing this I am scared of ending up on r/idodrugs .
My problems with alcohol have recently surpassed what is believed to be healthy, I have had 2 sober days this past week and the rest was filled with binge drinking.
I have had troubles with depression for a long time, the furthest back I remember the topic being discussed is 3rd grade. My teacher explicitly said that she feared I have depression and my ever demanding but uninvolved parents took no notice.
My therapist has recently had to leave me due to medical circumstances, just as I was opening up about the abuse, a little bit I sexual but mostly psychological and physical, I faced as a child. It feels like it’s the same every time, I open up to someone and they get scared away or the universe just takes them.
I am seriously contemplating seeing myself brought into a mental institution or killing myself, even though I don’t know how to convey the first thing to my parents.
If none of this makes sense I am terribly sorry, but I have been living in a state of confusion for Quite some time now.

TLDR: got the big sad
Sorry for formatting I am drunk and on mobile.
I hope that someone out there will finally be able to get me the help I need (even though some already tried)

My problems with alcohol have recently surpassed what is believed to be healthy, I have had 2 sober days this past week and the rest was filled with binge drinking.
I have had troubles with depression for a long time, the furthest back I remember the topic being discussed is 3rd grade. My teacher explicitly said that she feared I have depression and my ever demanding but uninvolved parents took no notice.
My therapist has recently had to leave me due to medical circumstances, just as I was opening up about the abuse, a little bit I sexual but mostly psychological and physical, I faced as a child. It feels like it’s the same every time, I open up to someone and they get scared away or the universe just takes them.
I am seriously contemplating seeing myself brought into a mental institution or killing myself, even though I don’t know how to convey the first thing to my parents.
If none of this makes sense I am terribly sorry, but I have been living in a state of confusion for Quite some time now.

TLDR: got the big sad
Sorry for formatting I am drunk and on mobile.
I hope that someone out there will finally be able to get me the help I need (even though some already tried)

I need advice from others with suicidal family members,"I need help, any advice just throw it at me. My sister is 19, she’s suffered from severe depression since she was a young kid. Me and my other sibling are bipolar but we have never been as depressed as her in our down phases. She is the sweetest person i’ve ever met and she cares so much about people. She has been drinking and driving which is out of character for her, she totaled her car 10 days ago because she tried to kill her self by getting ran over by a train, hit something else instead and came home freaking out. she spent a week in behavior health where she definitely played her cards right and got out in a week. She acted like her normal self and said she had felt much better. We were still watching her and  being cautious but she is 19 and still needs her space. fast forward 3 days later she drove my dads car since hers in totaled. She drove way out to the country, and drove on a back highway (the 2 lane with no street lights no sign of nothin kind of back highways)  and drove off the road! she rolled over the car multiple times until landing in a tree. she crawled out and got help as she only suffers from whiplash now, thankfully. that car is destroyed and crushed to nothing. no one including any medical staff understand how she survived. as soon as she got to the hospital she said she wants to die again. 

i don’t know what to do!! she is relentless and it is killing my mom and dad and destroying our family’s state of mind. we haven’t told any family outside of us 6. We never put her down for her thoughts or anything like that. we tell her we’ll accept her for whatever she needs even if it involves moving half way across the country.

I'm really not emotionally capable of having friends.,"Seriously. I'm too sensitive for my own good. If a friend of mine messages me something to let me know about something I'm doing wrong I literally just go into breakdown mode. 

I can't stop thinking of that time two years ago, when someone I thought was my best friend told me they had lied all that time I knew them and they never cared about me or the things I made. I can't take any chances. If a friend and I have a disagreement I immediately assume that they never cared about me or anything I said to them in the first place and that I'm a dumbass for even trying to trust again.

I've had this my entire life. I've waited for so long to see when it ""gets better"" and I have lived through depression in childhood all the way through to adulthood and it never did get better. It's getting worse, even, with work and college draining my very being. 

I pray to whatever's out there every single day that I die in my sleep or from sickness or something that would be deemed not my own doing.

If a friend of mine messages me something to let me know about something I'm doing wrong I literally just go into breakdown mode. 

I can't stop thinking of that time two years ago, when someone I thought was my best friend told me they had lied all that time I knew them and they never cared about me or the things I made. I can't take any chances. If a friend and I have a disagreement I immediately assume that they never cared about me or anything I said to them in the first place and that I'm a dumbass for even trying to trust again.

The incongruity and absurdity of life,"People are so cavalier about life until it comes to suicide. Death goes on around us all the time in ways much more tragic than suicide.

I feel like I'm going to kill myself by the end of the year,"For background, I'm 33 years old. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I'm on antidepressants, which I take regularly, and which allow me to actually function. I've been seeing a therapist for 4 years, and she's helped me deal with my past traumas. I started my first real job in January. It's a good job. I can finally afford to live on my own and pay off my student loans. This is what I've been wanting for years, and I finally have it.

But I feel closer to suicide than ever.

Now that I'm self-sufficient and at peace with myself, I just feel like there's really nothing to live for. I only have one real interest, and it makes me sad more often than not. I haven't been interested in relationships for years.

But the biggest problem is that I feel like there's no future. Honestly, the state of the world being what it is, I wish I'd killed myself years ago just to spare myself the constant grief. It's so bad that my family knows they can't talk about current events around me or I'll just crumple and be pretty much uncommunicative for hours. I just don't particularly want to spend whatever years I have left watching everything slowly die. I have no hope at all that things will get better.

My suicidal feelings come in waves. I feel relatively cheerful most of the time, but the urge is always there in the back of my mind. When it overtakes me, I spend hours unable to do anything but cry. I call the suicide hotline when I'm having a particularly bad episode, and they're able to talk me through it about half the time. (The rest of the time they're so mind-bogglingly incompetent that it distracts me enough to shake it off for a while.) My counselor hasn't been able to help with this issue at all, but I also haven't told her how bad it really is because I'm afraid of being hospitalized.

I actually had a health scare very recently and ended up in the ER, where I was basically told that my life was at risk, and I felt almost excited by the prospect. It was the first time I'd felt hopeful for something in years. But it's behind me now.

There’s not really any point in living with schizophrenia is there.,"I’m in the prodormal phase of SZ. Unfortunately I have enough insight and intelligence to realise that my self is inevitable to fragmentation. My ego is trapped in the room of a flooding ship, drowning amidst the tide of unconscious forces. Everyday it gets a worse, my entire visual experience feels ingenuine, artificial, like a copy of the world. I’m not immersed. And it feels like I’m viewing myself viewing this artificial world. 

This explains why I am able to drink 20 beers or take 10 tabs of acid and still be able to act like nothing happened. It’s horrible and there really is no escape.

My personality is so eccentric I struggle to relate to the everyday man. I see threads of reality that no one else sees, I’ve done things in life that very few people of done. Yet due to my illness I appear stupid, nervous. I can’t smile due to a flat face so nobody wants to be friends with me. And slowly I can feel my self being eaten by something that isn’t reflective of me at all.

I will not have my life hinge on horrible medications. I would like to be able to work with universities and share my personal experience for studies but I feel like that’s a lot of effort because I’d have to go to the states or Europe to do that.

I can just save all that hassle.

The “meaning” of life question could be answered pretty easily if you learn philosophy,"No offense, I know this is not related to helping suicide prevention, but you do know that if you went to college they teach you about philosophy and the “meaning” of life right? I’m just sitting here reading a lot of this while other doesn’t realize the answer is literally right in front of them when you can go to a good college that teach you about the meaning of life and other things that are similar to it, the answer was discovered about 100 years ago, I’ll just give you the fast answer, it might not make sense since you didn’t get the whole explanation here:

1- accept that it’s all meaningless, even if it is meaningless to accept it, and just be human

2-It’s meaningless nothing matter, do whatever the fuck you want

3-distract yourself with distractions, distract yourself with anything you can find

4-suicide

Also, some of the methods above only work if you still have  enough energy to get out of bed and do it, also if you think the “meaning of life” question were hard to be answered then I think It would surprised our that philosopher come up with answers everyday for it, just like the   Answer to why humans are greedy creatures but are actually not, here’s a fast answer: “almost all of the violence and crime around the world is caused by anxiety, insecurity’s and fear, I know it might not makes sense but like I said, if you want to get over you view of “everything is bad and humans are greedy creature or life is meaningless” I suggest you go learn more about it, also that should help you with some feeing if despair, but after you change your mid set, the only thing you need to face left is real depression, which is the hardest the to over come, the only thing I can really say is, get anti-depression or wait for that drug that is being work on to “cure all depression and stress” which would probably take forever to make it might never be made, since it’s basically the chemical that makes you happy, I think",t2_5ke00nji,1,0,0,"The “meaning” of life question could be answered pretty easily if you learn philosophy No offense, I know this is not related to helping suicide prevention, but you do know that if you went to college they teach you about philosophy and the “meaning” of life right?

Male) sick and tired of being bullied because I’m ugly...,"- [ ] I’m Male 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) long legs short torso  lanky slim body  framed and pale with a receding hairline so yea I’m fucked when it comes to looks. I’m a kissless virgin. When I was younger I was small faced in proportion to my body so it was fine. Now I’m older my head lols too big for my body. .And now more than ever I  noticed over time I get stared at like iv got 3 heads and treated poorly by most and it’s because I’m ugly. Every night getting drunk alone. I don’t leave the house and havnt for 4 years  except for 6 hours a week to work at a football  stadium as somebody there to help (a steward) . I used to enjoy it and it made me excited to go out and do something . but other times it’s not easy on my mental health as sometimes ppl stare at me for longer than normal and not look away and it’s 99% girls who do this (no it’s not the good kind of stares I’m 100% sure)  one night one girl in a queue stared at me facially then grimaced me down and she was like 4ft. , I always get picked for the shitty jobs (part of being ugly) Last week some young guy walked past me stared at me walking past it was obvious what he was thinking with a disgusted look on his face. Another higher up authority young guy there always stares at me a lot  and I assume it because I’m ugly (I once overheard him refer to me as a ‘creature’ to his friend) he stares at every shift and he’s nothing special either but when he’s when he’s talked to me he’s seemed nice and friendly with me. I now have to wear a beanie and a snood to cover myself up and guess what? The stares stopped. Being stared down because I’m tall and slim happens so often too it’s made me develop an eating disorder and now my face has gotten fat. I don’t ever wanna leave the house Just last week I was at work at that stadium job around a lot of people  and a girl and her dad was standing drinking and the girl looked at me with a blank glare (I only stared back because I thought she needed help with something as that’s what I’m there for) and she looked back up to her dad with a disgusted look on her face and said ‘ewwwwww god no’ (I lipread her) it was ok for her as she had tons of makeup on like it was a mask covering her face tho but was quick to judge? I mean cmon I leave the house for the first time in 3 months and then that happened 2 hours in to a shift? I mean cmon can I get a break. My dad said to me a few months ago ‘it bothers me that youv never had the love of a good woman, it’s a crying shame, it must bother you’ and I just shrugged and said ‘I’m too ugly’ which I am. I wake up every morning with suicidal thoughts crying and replaying the ppl calling me ugly over and over again in my head. I never knew being ugly would make life so difficult. I can’t have a life as much as I want to because I’ll just get bullied and treated like shit. Especially by girls who can fraud their faces with makeup and won’t leave the house without it on but judge me because I’m ugly. I have bad depression because of my looks too so it’s difficult to not look very tired and pale too. I spend every birthday and Xmas alone and it’s because I’m ugly, whoever said personality matters more eh? And I’m sick and  tired of trying to help someone when it’s a women and they’re always snotty and dismissive I take it personally everytime. Thats the most painful thing, when a women will be cold towards me even when iv not done or said anything wrong but will open up to the attractive guys even if he’s being a complete douche. 5 years ago in 2014-2015  I worked in a nice bar in a good posh area and had confidence and a good life good friends and a gorgeous girl I worked with had a crush on me and let me know. but she will be the only girl who will ever like me, it will never happen again.

Well I guess this is it,"I tried to be optimistic. I’ve been unemployed since January, relying on my parents to take care of me and my daughter who I have sole custody of. It took almost two months to get my first interview. I have yet to receive another one, even though I apply to at least two jobs per day, and have since I became unemployed. I was informed today, two weeks after the fact, that I didn’t get the job. I’m over it at this point. Why would good things happen to me, that would be too easy. My daughter is going to be staying with her mom for a few weeks starting next week so I’ll probably do it then. 

Before anyone says “think of your daughter” or “think about this person” or “think about that person”

I’m fully aware I’m making a selfish decision. My daughter is 3 so she’ll forget me soon enough. My parents are aware I’m suicidal but they really aren’t doing much. They’re only giving me money because I have my daughter. I don’t really have any friends, and the few I do have, I’m not even close to their top priority friends.

I’ve been unemployed since January, relying on my parents to take care of me and my daughter who I have sole custody of. It took almost two months to get my first interview. I have yet to receive another one, even though I apply to at least two jobs per day, and have since I became unemployed. I was informed today, two weeks after the fact, that I didn’t get the job. I’m over it at this point. Why would good things happen to me, that would be too easy. My daughter is going to be staying with her mom for a few weeks starting next week so I’ll probably do it then. 

Before anyone says “think of your daughter” or “think about this person” or “think about that person”

I’m fully aware I’m making a selfish decision. My daughter is 3 so she’ll forget me soon enough. My parents are aware I’m suicidal but they really aren’t doing much. They’re only giving me money because I have my daughter. I don’t really have any friends, and the few I do have, I’m not even close to their top priority friends.

Suicidal Thoughts Everyday @ Work,"I don't know why, but everyday I go to work in the poultry industry I think about hanging myself in the garage. If I quit I run out of money before I can get disability. Disability could take years. I don't have years. I'm young, but I can't manage to get up for work everyday and do the simplest job packing line work. You talk to someone you are in trouble. Don't get me started on the reverse racism, so surprised. Being drilled about my performance when all I think about is how much I would rather kill myself than continue working there. The feelings are getting so strong I may have missed too many days to go back at this point anyway. My parents poured so much love in me and I'm 30 about to be homeless again and really need disability... I know that I can't keep working under these conditions my mind isn't right I'm so depressed. I get along with people on the job, people tend to like me. But, I'm not all that attractive anymore and I feel like if I looked good I'd be better off. So I keep looking at surgeries to get and I see that they are expensive dermabrasion is like 5k or more... But even if I get all these things I know I won't be happy with myself. I feel so ugly I want to die a lot.

Ism what to do meds and therapy only work so much. Its like everything stopped working.

If Bernie Loses I Will Have no Future Worth Living for,"I thought things were going well. Bernie was on track to get the nomination as early as Super Tuesday and I would have a future worth living. He'd win, get M4A passed and cancel my unfair student loans I was forced to take. Then came Obama, too deceitful and cowardly to outright endorse Biden, talking with Pete and Amy to consolidate the moderate vote while Elizabeth Warrens stayed in and cost Bernie a win in 5 states: Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Texas, giving Biden a lead and the MSM the ability to generate more and more undeserved momentum for Soupbrain Biden. Now I seriously have to wonder if I will have a future. We have 10 years to lower emissions to stop the worst case scenario of Climate Change according to the IPCC. 10 years. After which it will be guaranteed there will be mass amounts of migration around the world and a lower amount of vital resources needed for life such as arable land and drinking water that will lead to societal collapse. Bernie is the only one who can get our country on track to even have a chance of stopping it. 

Even if this was not the case and I wouldn't be forced to live through a climate-induced collapse of civilization, my life would be hell. I'd be stuck in student loan debt because I wasn't born into a rich family. In addition, as a transgender person, this debt and lack of health insurance would make it impossible to transition until I am in a better financial situation, which would be too old for me to ever pass (ie not look like a guy in a dress to the average person). I know people will say ""what about 2024""?, but that won't happen, because NO ONE is going to have the same appeal as Sanders for a generation at least. The appeal needed to create a broad coalition to win. Even then, 2024 would also be too late and I'd be stuck having to watch the world die due to climate change. There is no future worth living without Bernie Sanders winning the nomination and the Presidency. If Biden wins because Obama and the establishment couldn't let the people not be broke and stuck on a dying planet, I'm going to kill myself. I almost did so on Super Tuesday, so I'm pretty sure I can do so if Trump is set for a second term by the establishment's dirty tricks.

Drowning in the beach,"I listen to tango. This specific tango always comforts me, it has something warm about it. I have rarely felt comfortable. Life has been more discomfort. Perhaps that is why Argentina enchanted me and enchants me today. Tango brings me comfort, it brings me heat: why wouldn't Argentina (or Uruguay) have the same effect?

I'm still lonely. I continue a thousand things. But now I'm a freshman of Portuguese Literature at the glorious Federal University of Santa Catarina. I care about rankings so I went to see where the little princess of Trindade was and we are (we are? I'm hardly a freshman) the twenty-second in Latin America. I remained sad. Perhaps rankings are not that important.

I thought maybe I was going to be hospitalized last week. Fortunately, I wasn't. Because I tried to kill myself recently, they infer that soon I will have to try again. The psychiatrist did not want to leave the medication with me. I said that I wasn't crazy about trying something new with medication. I have the recipes.

I don't even know more than to complain. Yes, I am lonely. I've always been lonely. I didn't have most of the experiences of an ordinary teenager. I have a few friends. I never went to their homes. Maybe I don't have friends. My family is dysfunctional and I learned what suicide means from an early age. I talked to my mom last week and I almost had an anxiety attack.

"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized.

Tonight I'm going to die.,"I'm tired. I'm supposed to leave for work in 2 hours or so. But, I'm not going. And because of it, I'll be fired. My depression has gotten the best of me and has won. I'm going to die. No matter how long it takes, or what I have to do to make it happen. It's going to happen. So, guess I'll write goodbye letters to people who matter to me even though I'm sure they wont see it. 

Family: To my family.. my mother, my father, my sister, my brother.. and others whom are related to me. Thank you for raising me to know what love was. Unfortunately, that was taken away from me as well as my dignity and I'm miserable. I'll miss all of you. My main family especially. I love you all and hope you know that you guys were honestly my best friends. My everything. But I just wasn't strong enough for you and I'm sorry. 

To my friend: (Al, is what we will call her.) I've known you for 15 or more years and you've done so much for me over those years. We were so close we were practically sisters. I hope that you will not miss me too much. But, know that I love you and hope that you and your boyfriend make it to where you want in life. Because I know I havent. So, good luck with your life, and thank you for everything. 

To my Ex-Boyfriend (C) : C, I've never loved anyone as much as I have loved you. You showed me a love I'd never gotten before. Until you stopped. And gave it to others. More than one person got your love, and over time... I became dust. Regardless of the pain you put me through, the loyalty I still had for you even to this day, I don't regret. Which, yeah, it's going to make no sense because i do, however... regret speaking to you. I never would have had to endure so much pain on top of all my depression and anxiety if I'd never spoken to you. I loved you, yeah. I still do. I dont regret dating you, i dont regret loving you, nor do I regret knowing you. But, I really do regret speaking to you. I would've been so pain free if I'd never have spoken to you. Lying and cheating on someone is very harsh and painful to ones heart. But, even after all that you've done and said to me. I still love you. And I hope you know now, that you can, and will be free after tonight.. so, good luck with your life. I hope you get to where you wish to be. 

Anyone else I've not mentioned, just know those whom are close to me I love dearly. I'm 22, almost 23 years old. And I'm tired. Im drained and I am going to say that I'm deeply sorry for doing what I've done. Or am going to accomplish tonight. I wont make it to 23, because my birthday is May 29th.

"I am so lucky with my life circumstances, but I was born with a very sick mind. I just don't understand why it had to be like this","I'm 22 years old.  I have become self aware of everything wrong with me in the past few months. I have realized I am likely a covert malignant narcissist. I have always been quiet/shy/introverted but I have done awful things in the past that have significantly hurt people close to me. I had “forgiven” myself for these things but I realized some of these things are quite insidious and unforgivable. Even though I’d never want to do them again it’s always going to follow me, and it will probably catch up to me eventually and I’ll end up in prison. I have some antisocial/psychopathic and sadistic traits that have shocked me to come to terms with. It’s useless to label myself though. I’m just fucked up

I think I definitely am on the autistic spectrum too. I’ve talked to myself my whole life, I am in my own little world. I have full on conversations with myself even in public sometimes, and I’m so bad in social situations and always come off as awkward because I literally cannot listen or relate to people. I have very specific and obsessive interests that most people don’t care about.  I have made great friends in the past but now that I've graduated college I've lost them all, I got insecure about my unemployment and job prospects so I cut everyone off.  And made them more worried about me

I also have horrible ADHD/focus/impulse control. When I was young I would be in karate class but just sit in the corner and roll around and talk to myself.

I’m bad at sports, I can run fast but that's basically about it.  I’m basically bad at everything. My biggest talents are guitar and golf but really I’m not that great at those either.

I have no ability to plan ahead or set realistic goals for myself for the future. I have no stable sense of identity and have constantly changed my behavior/music/clothes to get others to think I’m cool. I have no feasible idea what I would like to do for a career. Everything seems somewhat interesting yet I would quickly become bored of it.

I’m lowkey a huge pervert who thinks with his dick. I remember peeping up women’s skirts when I was 3 years old.

I hate being the center of attention but I want people to care and worry about me. It gives me a rush

I am jobless because I can’t move on from my sad pathetic past, and therefore I am doomed to a sad pathetic future. I’ve completely disassociated.  I just sit on the computer hoping I can go back and time and fix everything.

I envy so many people.  Because I'm so incompetent and I've done nothing but ruin myself, I just sit and envy all those who actually have plans and are making something out of themselves.

I am a spineless coward who hates confrontation and can’t stand up for himself, and can’t form an opinion for himself.

**I am literally so lucky too**, I was born into a big wonderful family that loves me so much, and also has a lot of money so I’ve never had to worry about anything. Which with my personality disorders explains why I have shit work ethic etc. The world could’ve been my oyster yet I was born with a defunct brain that would only lead me to ruining my own life.

It’s funny how I’m even blaming “the way I was born” for where I am in life. There’s no excuse for my behavior and actions. We all have free will, or so we like to think. I could try and say my mom drank/smoked while I was in the womb but what’s the point, I am how I am.

All I know is I’ve not been normal since I was born. I do remember they said I hit my head while I was being baptized. Maybe that was it.

I’m literally crazy, a huge moron with no common sense and likely pure evil at my core. How can someone be born like this? How?!? I want to care and give a shit about others, I always thought I did but I think it was for my own ego. I should probably kill myself so I can spare anyone else I may hurt, but the only thing stopping me is that I would ruin my family’s lives. I guess the best way to go would be to tell them who I really am, everything bad I’ve done so they can disown me and then I can die with no one missing me.

I’m sorry mom, dad, my twin sister, my grandparents, everyone who always saw potential in me because I was creative and good at math.

I’m suicidal but I don’t really want to die,"My whole life is going to shit and I hate it so fucking much. Not to go into too much detail (that’s what r/vent is for), but there’s a couple incidents that are really making me revert back to when I self harmed a lot.

My friend’s parents took his phone and basically are verbally abusing him for being trans and intentionally misgendering him.

I can’t come out to my parents or else I might be kicked out.

My friends are all leaving me at a disturbingly fast rate.

My ex broke up with me a few weeks ago and was really fucking bad about his word choice and ended up hurting me a lot

One of my friends found out about my self harm

I’m failing in two subjects and I don’t have any motivation to bring my grades up other than the fear that my parents will yell at me

There’s a lot more but those are the major stressors. I keep having recurrent thoughts of “what if I killed myself, would anyone miss me?” “How would “x” react if I was suddenly gone?” “What if I just stopped existing? Would my family be sad?” And other stuff like that. Suicidal ideation, I guess you could call it. I don’t really want to die. The thought of suicide scares me, and I know there’s a lot more to look forward to, but right now I just can’t handle the load of everything. I don’t trust my therapist a lot and I only see her once every two weeks, and I barely have anyone I can talk to anymore.

Interviews with a graduate researcher,"Hi, I'm a PhD student who's currently doing work on trauma and processes of mourning. I've had several people in my life take their own lives, and I have a history of ideation of my own. I'm looking for maybe four to five interviews with people who would be interested in discussing their feelings on suicide and thoughts about it. If Reddit especially is important in contextualizing or discussing your feelings, I'd be interested in hearing about that too. These would be STRICTLY anonymous and confidential, with no identification involved at any point in time. The interviews could also be conducted on whichever platform - Reddit, Skype, some anonymous platform, whatever works for you.

Is there a way to exist in a non-burdensome way?,"I feel offensive. All the time. 

When I talk about my feelings I feel attn seeky. 

When I hold in my emotions I feel in-genuine. 

When I get close to someone I feel anxious that I’m somehow subconsciously tricking them into liking me. 

When I isolate I feel like I’m worrying people or am being a freak.

When I joke around I worry I’m cringey or making people uncomfortable.

When I give my honest opinion I feel like a bitch.

When I go along with people despite opposing feelings I feel artificial and like a fraud.

This world wasn’t designed for someone like me,"I’ve decided I’m ready to go after two failed hanging attempts over the last decade. I’ll be purchasing a gun and blowing my brains out in the woods near the New River Gorge where nature can reclaim my remains.

I’m a pregnant trans male who is on the spectrum, chronically suicidal, C-PTSD, and going through a divorce from someone with antisocial personality disorder (he cheated and ran off with a real woman when I stopped being a trophy wife). I’ve been formally disowned by my narcissist mother and I’m considered a family secret by almost everyone else. There are few jobs in the state which I live and little hope of escaping the economic depression. 

To put it simply I’m exhausted and will set a date for my suicide once my child is born and safe. It will provide enough time to put affairs in order and make sure the funeral is planned out. Knowing my kid will never know me or know pain when I pass helps. I wish I could be there for them, but they deserve better.

I can’t continue fighting in a world that just doesn’t want people such as myself in it. Nor do I want my child to be exposed to suffering, my depression, or face intense prejudice by proxy and end up resenting me.

The revolver I’m picking out is strangely comforting. There’s literally no other way out of this and I’m ready to accept death on my own terms late this fall.

Feeling pathetic and pointless,"I read the ""No More Mr. Niceguy"" yesterday and installed Tinder in the morning. Bad idea! Feeling suicidal again.

Why am I like this?,"  Hello everyone! This is my first time posting something on this site: I always imagined that my first question would be exciting or interesting, something worth reading. Instead, it's my last attempt to understand why I am the way I am, why is my whole existence so shallow. 

I'll turn eighteen in July, and by some unwritten rule I should be enjoying life, being free and careless, finding myself at the peak of the existential nirvana. Oh, those teenage years, they should be the best time of my life!
And yet,the fatigue is irremediable:it has sucked everything in me and it never gets satisfied of me, it will feel it's fullness only when the earth will swallow me in a silent vortex, in the tranquility that perhaps I deserve. I don't really have someone that cares for me nor that would be upset about me disappearing. There are many things that I'm bitter about, that leave me with that 'what if' possibilities open. Sadly, I'll never know. This is the path that led me to write this post, to decide whether I should keep going or not. 

Humans as a race crave interaction and were not made to be lonely. They're complex: emotions are necessary to build bonds and long-lasting relationships. According to Freud, however, the origin of social feelings is to be found in the feeling of jealousy that has as its object the mother and that opposes the brothers between them. When each one realizes that he cannot prevail over the others, he fights for at least equality of all and domination of one. Freud therefore believes that social justice means giving up a lot so that others too can give it up. This demand for equality,forms the root of social consciousness and a sense of duty. See? We all have different points of view when it comes to nearly anything. Now close your eyes. What do you see?
I see the mountains. Covered by a thick layer of snow. The snow shines in the sun. The frost pinches my cheeks, and I'm happy. Let's organize the snowball fight. Some create snowmen, others instead, sip hot chocolate and laugh when we are hit by a snowball. This is what I want. I think we all want it.
And what do you see?
In fact, give me a moment. Just enough time to finish, okay? Then I'll make you talk.

Take another breath. Take as much fresh air into your lungs as possible.
As if it was your last breath.

I am surrounded by a sense of peace and tranquility. Silence. And what do you feel? Silence, bliss, fear? It's difficult to tell, but I can perceive your confusion through the screen. Now restart the tape: the truth is that I don't feel anything. What I have described is just an idealized image that comes to mind in front of the word 'happiness', although I myself am not able to live it. 
I live a monotonous reality that flows before my eyes, without me being able to grasp it. Actually, I don't even live. I only exist. 
I imitate what I see to fit into what surrounds me because I do not have the strength or the ability to experience true feelings; I am not interested in creating solid relationships, healthy friendships and this throws me into a depressing spiral of loneliness. 
I don't particularly mind the latter, reading takes up most of my time, otherwise I sleep. It's as if I'm in a limbo, in the middle of nothing that stimulates me. I just simply don't care. This boring interlude of NOTHINGNESS is sometimes interrupted by my incredible narcissism and self-worship. Other times, however, this almost divine vision that I created of myself is non-existent. 
I try to be interested in something, to find myself a hobby, but every single thing occupies my concentration for a week at most. 
Why do others really live? Why can't I really live too? Why does my mind swing so much?


I have so little time available. I am not interested in living for other long years in this way. My psyche burns, my eyeballs are also burning: I would tear them away with my bare hands if I could.

On a suicide watch sub. If you care to read this rant about why my life is a shit hole go ahead. If not, I’m unbothered... Here it goes.

So here’s some back story... My mom died when I was 4, I’m 20 now. my dad has had 2 girlfriends in the 16 years my mother has been gone. One of them was an argument every night and abusive type of situation and the current one is, well... she’s a bitch. A complete bitch.. Now, I’ve never really, “hated” someone but, I honestly really do hate her. She has ruined me and my dad’s life. First off, she has 4 of her grandkids living with us and her son.. YES, GRANDKIDS. It is complete bullshit. All I hear every fucking day is yelling and kids crying and then she just has the worst attitude. She’s not supportive AT ALL, she’s so negative and just loves to talk people down. She verbally and sometimes physically abuses the kids.. Now.. I know what you are probably thinking. Why the hell don’t I move out? Well, I’ll tell you why. I have shitty credit, I own a dog, and I’m unemployed at them moment because I quit my night job. Why did I quit my night job? because, I was depressed and just decided I can’t work nights because my mental health and wellbeing should come first. 
  So, back to the situation. My dad has tried to get rid of her and frankly. I don’t think he even wants her hut, she pays bills so I think thats the only reason she’s here... Well and he’s kind of being a pussy to kick her out because the whole kids situation and last time he was going to kick her out SHE COMPLETELY PLAYED VICTIM. Like sobbing and just being so selfish. Thats what she is after all. Selfish, this woman and at the time were just her son and only 2 grandkids came into my house with neither me or my sister knowing, just completely randomly came into my house and decided to move in. My dad didn’t even talk to us about any of it. He would go to her house and leave us here alone for days. My dad isn’t a very good parent honestly. Anyway, I just don’t know what to do. I’m tired of the kids, the yelling, the attitudes, the negativity, I don’t think there’s any kind of support except when her son does something good or anything.. That’s the only thing she cares about, her son. I’ve tried changing myself and being positive and all this. I quit smoking, stopped doing drugs, had a job, etc. I’m on a good path technically speaking but, I mean I don’t know what to do. Somehow I always get depressed again and I can’t escape this house or do anything.

First time poster on the other side of the problem,"I've tried to do my best to just not vocalize any of this because I don't like feeling like a weight other people have to worry or care about, but I seriously think I need to get this off my chest or I'm not going to be able to handle it.


I'm just kind of... generally a failure, I think. My dad's this fantastic software developer and my mom's a wonderfully supportive parent, my sister just managed to come out as trans and my younger two sisters are amazing artists for their ages and I can envision them doing great things, but I'm just some worthless sack of meat that does nothing but sit around, wasting time online.

I'm turning 20 this year, and I've never accomplished anything... worthwhile. I don't have the drive to do anything, I can't get a job, and to make things worse, because I'm diagnosed with T1D, I'm a massive drain on money for the rest of the family.
I honestly don't see any way to improve. I've tried, god knows I have, but the moment it seems like things are getting better, they don't, even if I try to push through it. 

And if this is all life is going to be, why bother going through the rest of it? The only reason I haven't done anything is I don't want my siblings to have to deal with seeing that, but I caught myself staring at the knife rack in the kitchen multiple times, just... imagining how much better off everyone would be.

More money for college and food and other nice things, no disappointment when I fail to do basic chores around the house, no more excuses for why I slept in until two in the afternoon /again/.

I hate being this kind of person. I don't want to, anymore, but the only way I legitimately see myself getting better is to just not /be/ anymore.

"Calling the police ""because they care""","A week and a day ago, a now ex-friend's parents called the local police for a wellness check on me, and proceeded to call my parents as well which sent them into a massive panic. It's still bothering and pissing me off to this day. I expected an apology for this, she responded by telling a mutual friend that she needed space. She thinks we're still friends and will be on the other side. We are not, and will not be. At a minimum, she has burned any opportunity to apologize and repair our friendship. Generally though I fully intend to be dead long before she comes around to deciding she wants to be friends again.

This has resulted in another friendship with someone I was incredibly close to pretty much ending because that friend went too far in defending her, and the net result is that I'm pissed at her and don't see her fixing that any time soon. 

I have had multiple people try to tell me this showed me that she cared. If she did, she had plenty of other routes to go that didn't involve panicking my parents or the police. It was the laziest route possible. I would honestly rather be dead than even threatened with involuntary commitment, and nothing anybody says will ever convince me otherwise.

But today didn't go as planned and I set the plan off. Because I'm making excuses for myself so that I don't die.

So I was just sending compliments and writing ""okey bye"" in the end to people in school. Bc I wanted to say goodbye to them. AND THEY STARTED TO GIVE ME COMPLIMENTS BACK AND THIS CUTE GIRL IS NOW CALLING ME CUTE BACK.

WTF I JUST WANT TO STOP LIVING WHY DO YOU MAKE IT SO HARD FOR ME TO LEAAAVE

Shit sucks. I know that people cares about me but it hurts so damn much. Fuck all of this aaaargh.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm not enough anything. People have it way worse than me and I'm just here being a cry baby. I have no reasons to feel like this.

I think I'm ready (LONG),"I'm sorry this is long, I have nowhere else to turn at this point. You don't have to read it all. Basically I'm probably going to try to kill myself again this week.

It's currently almost 10am; I have a class in an hour and 80+ slides of notes to go through but all I can do is lie in bed wishing I were dead. I'm just so tired of feeling this way; everything hurts and my soul feels heavier and heavier every day. I feel like not even my therapist understands my unrelenting desire to die. I don't think it gets better for everyone, some people are meant to be sad forever and I think I'm one of those people. 

I've hesitated posting about this because I don't want reassurance or encouragement that ""it'll be okay."" It all feels like lies but it's all I ever hear. My life has gotten sort of better, I got a new job that actually pays well and is nice to me, and I have a really cool new roommate. But I still feel hollow and empty and way way too stressed. I have to write a paper every week for one of my classes, the 80+ slides per week is a low number compared to most weeks, and I work at my old job for another week. 

Maybe my outer problems don't seem that bad, they really aren't bad I guess, but the internal pain is what makes everything so much harder. I used to be able to shove it all down and grin and bear it when it came to the mundane shit in life but now I can barely get myself out of bed. It's worse than its ever been. I used to be able to get up and go to school/work the day after a failed suicide attempt and now I can't even get out of bed on a ""good"" day. Nothing feels worth it anymore. I'm just working and getting through bullshit until I die. 

I lost one of my pet rats on Friday. She was sick and I was too depressed and busy to take her to the vet when I should have. No matter what you say, I know it was my fault. I should've been there for her and I wasn't. I feel like I can't be there for anyone, and when I can be there for people they don't want me. There's a million other things going wrong but she's all I care about right now. I don't want anyone else in my life to die but I know they will, and I don't want to be alive to see them die. 

I have too much unresolved trauma, loose ends without closure, regret that's piling up, and self hatred that only grows with every day. I almost cry every morning when I realize I've woken up. Sometimes I'm happy, but those moments are fleeting and not nearly enough for me to ""hold on to when times get rough."" It's not worth it anymore. I have a boyfriend and I know this will hurt him, but the selfish thing is that I don't care. I don't care if I hurt people by dying anymore. I'm done. I'm already in so much pain just existing. I'm ready to do it. 

I think I'm going to try to hang myself. If that doesn't work, bleeding out with enough alcohol in my system so if the blood loss doesn't kill me the alcohol will. I know it sounds dumb I'm posting about this like i'm trying to get someone to stop me, but no one can. I just want it out there because it'll hold me accountable and I don't chicken out. I'm not afraid of hurting people when I go, I don't care, but I am afraid of failing.

Is it normal to just feel empty?,"I can’t really think of another way to describe it; sometimes I just have no emotion, like nothing is inside of me. I hate it so much. I feel like I’m missing a part of me and I don’t know what to do. 

This feeling normally lasts for like a week then turns into depressive episodes of just not wanting to live anymore (currently what I’m stuck in, admittedly)

The thing is, I don’t even have a reason to feel like this. My life is what many people would call ideal. I don’t have an excuse to feel sad, I just am. I hate myself for this especially

At Least I Have Tomorrow,"Today hasn't been a good day. No jobs called back, I fell in mud and ruined the only pair of nice shoes I had, my right knee is messed up (dont have insurance), and my brain isn't exactly behaving how I want it to. The only redeeming part of today is that I said I wanted to die but another voice spoke louder and said you want to live. 

This is important because suicide used to be a comfort to me but for the first time in a long time I seemed to have shift in my mindset. I never thought this possible, even a few weeks ago (month). I feel anxious, sad, and a little hopeless but it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm learning to cope with my trauma and the learned habits I developed to protect myself from the ugliness of my environment. I'm not 100% better, I still have problems with my social anxiety, my self-worth, and night terrors but I'm actually starting to believe that I have a future. I stopped seeing one awhile ago, literally nothing came to mind, but hope regained its flutters and it's stirring something inside of me. 

I guess why I'm posting this is because I wanted to see success stories while I was hurting.Those stories where things aren't always okay but there was a sense of hope hidden between the tales.

Wanting to die,"I don't exactly want to live anymore. There is just nothing to life that gives me any reaction and I feel empty and numb inside.

The therapist asked me about suicide and I said I am thinking about it often.

She said, in her mind, suicide is a really reason to end your life and a shitty way to die. So I told her that nobody has ever given me a convincing answer as to why I should not kill myself when I hardly think about anything else. She dodged the question. Just as well.

If I thought there was anything after death I would feel so happy that I can finally kill myself without fear.,"Im a piece of shit that deserves to suffer and die a horrible death.

Sometimes when im alone though I will let it open and just accept that terrifying wave of pain, but no matter how long I stay curled up hugging my pillows waiting at the bottom of the ocean of misery, it never goes away fully.

Depression and the people who treat it,"I’m posting this again here. As I tried to post three times previously with not one comment or vote in any other communities. 

I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right? 
I don’t know. If this is what our society has come to, I seriously want no part of it anymore. It’s disgusting and I am to the point where I hate people in general. I know that sounds bad, but go back up and re-read my post if you really want to try to understand why I am starting to hate people. I wasn’t always this way. Yes, I’ve dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another. But here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom. I look back at times when I thought I was depressed before and I think to myself - I’d give anything to go back to that time and redo things. 
I don’t really have anything else to say. I’ve rambled on enough. I just had to get this all out in some way. If you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you. You’ve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression - until the insurance money stopped coming.",t2_rjgx7de,2,0,0,"Depression and the people who treat it I’m posting this again here. As I tried to post three times previously with not one comment or vote in any other communities. 

I have to get this off my chest or I’m going to go off on someone. So as you can read back through my posts, I was doing Spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me. Two weeks into it, that’s right - TWO WEEKS, Insurance comes back after pre-approving my treatment and says since I had not shown a 50% improvement they were denying any further treatments. Thanks for the warning fuckers! So of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened. Partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this. And second, my body and mind didn’t care for how I just suddenly stopped treatments. So I’ve been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now. 
Well the clinic where I was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they aren’t getting money from my insurance. When the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do. That was almost two weeks ago. I’ve spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back. Like seriously ... What the fuck? You have someone who was telling you I was severely depressed and suicidal (enough to get approved for disability - which is not easy to do!) and you’re just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside? What happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step? Is that it? Is it just like - well no more Spravato for you so we are done dealing with you?! I’m fed the fuck up quite honestly. And after waiting all week since talking to her Monday, I’m going to call tomorrow and I’m asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place. Let me just add also that when I first contacted them to set up my initial appointment, it took almost two months before I got in there! That’s right! Two months! It was the beginning of December when I first called and someone was supposed to call me back and I waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them “do I have to say I’m suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back??” It was soon after I finally got in there but to me that’s a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated. 
Between that and the insurance screwing me, I’m truly and utterly fed up. It makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it! Well no fucking wonder. If others are treated anything like I have been, and I have a feeling that many are, then I can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others. Let me clarify - I’m NOT in any way condoning that behavior or saying it’s okay. I’m simply saying that it’s no wonder there’s such an issue with mental illness in this county. 
All that being said, where does one go from here? I’ve tried therapists, countless medicines, obviously the Spravato - all to come to this. To pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored! I hate to sound narcissistic, but god damn. My life should be just as important as anyone else’s. 
Here’s the conclusion I’ve pretty much come to in the last 24 hours. I have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness. I have to depend on myself to somehow get better. I am the only one who is here for me. Nobody else gives a fuck. Nobody. Why should they? They have nothing invested in me and I mean nothing. If they aren’t getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right?

I see it quite clearly now. Suicide IS the best option for me.,"I've been meditating a lot recently and I've come to the conclusion that there simply is no reason for me to be here. I don't like or care for anything in the world. I don't understand why someone with a mental illness would want to get better. There is nothing on the other end. I guess there is for some people, but not for me. Not because no one cares for me, some do, but because I don't care for anyone or anything. I don't care that my family will miss me and wonder what they did wrong. They did nothing wrong except for creating me. None of this would've happened had I not existed, and that's their burden to bear. I have hobbies to pass the time. When I don't think much about it I like them. When I actually think deeply about it I realise how pointless they are.

I guess I would like to be convinced otherwise, but none of your false optimism is going to sway me. Things could get better, sure, but if I was dead I would never know, so what's the point in risking even more suffering for myself? As I said, the suffering of others is of no concern to me.

Suicide seems to be my only option. (TW: rape),"This will be long. I'm 22F. So to start from the beginning, my father was emotionally abusive as a kid (for example: he'd threaten to kill my mom and kidnap me and take me to Mexico, literally tried to hire a hit on my mom, threatened to sell me into sex slavery etc.). I also developed a phobia of dogs as a kid. My father used this against me by threatening to lock me outside with his two dogs (German Shepard and a large mutt) if I didn't do what he said. For example, he'd call my mother a bitch and if I tried to defend her he'd threaten to lock me outside with the dogs. So I did whatever I had to in order to appease him. 
Well, in third grade my mom moved us out of the state (away from all family unfortunately) and I've never seen him again. He got locked up when I was in middle school (unrelated charge) and has been in prison ever since. My phobia of dogs became way worse because of him so I was too scared to play outside or go to friends' houses as a kid. So I have always been a loaner. Eventually I became terrified of all insects too, which also made me despise leaving the house. 
Started developing severe OCD/depression/anxiety/suicidal ideation in middle school. Also became terrified of demons/evil spirits, convincing myself that there were demons in the house. I have at many times been convinced that I was possessed by a demon. For years I have even sometimes hallucinated shadow figures, spirits, and insects. I also have severe derealization and depersonalization. This causes my memory to be terrible. Sometimes I don't even recognize my own face in photos.
When I was 17, my dumb ass started selling weed (maybe as a way to make me feel less numb) so I started putting myself in bad situations because, again, I'm a fucking dumb ass. I spent the night at a 21 year old guy's house and I had sex with him once consentually. Then he raped me later that night. I was too scared to fight back cuz he had 2 big dogs in the other room, and he had them kind of as guard dogs so they were not friendly. Then I think he drugged me after that cuz things got hazy and I was really out of it. He left the room and told me to lay on my stomach then I heard his two roommates come in with him (but the room was pitch black so I couldn't see) and they all raped me (in all possible ways) and eventually I passed out but woke up in the morning and was bleeding; it hurt so fucking bad. He acted as though nothing happened. Again, I was too out-of-it and scared of their dogs to fight back. When I got home I noticed w*sps outside and became terrified, marking the beginning of my crippling phobia of w*sps. I can't say the word so don't comment that word without the asterisk please. I think of their $tingers as dicks so when I see one I kinda think they're trying to rape me. If that makes any sense. 
Then i started hooking up with a 34 year old and one time i went to his house and he had been drinking and i made it very clear that i didnt wanna have sex but he raped me anyways. Then one time i was selling someone an ounce of weed and he robbed me and raped me in the back seat of my car. All 3 rapes happened within a six month span. 
So the phobia of w*sps/dogs is so bad I literally only leave my house for work and even then im terrified. No one understands. They all just say to get over it. Therapists are all useless. 
So obviously I have no friends. I go to college online (I wanna be a teacher) but am so depressed I gave up a week ago, didn't do any of my midterms, so of course I'm failing all those classes. I have body dysmorphia and hate myself with a burning passion. I'm 5 foot 6, 103 pounds but still think I'm fat as fuck. I can see my ribs and hip bones, but I have a large bone structure so I'm still fat. I starve myself to lose weight (I wanna lose 15 more pounds) and mainly only consume calories in alcohol.

A friend of mine really needs help and I'm out of ideas.,"TLDR: A friend of mine is going through some real hard times, lots of trouble with her parents and with recent horrible things that happened to her.

I've been close to her for about one year, and we've rarely seen each other, but she trusts me and I'm trying my best to help her.

She already attempted to commit suicide, but it didn't work, and since then she's been a little better.

But today she texted me saying that after what happened last weekend ruined her (this guy that she thought was her friend only wanted sex and now she's blocked), plus she honestly thinks her mother hates her. In her words, it has come to a point where she has no reason to live anymore.

I've tried and tried but she does not listen to me and keeps saying that she'll do it.

Any ideas on how to convice her otherwise?",t2_zvgva,3,0,0,"A friend of mine really needs help and I'm out of ideas. TLDR: A friend of mine is going through some real hard times, lots of trouble with her parents and with recent horrible things that happened to her.

I'm ready to go,"I've struggled with mental illness for a long time. I was doing better, but recently I've just gotten to the worst point of my life. 

I feel like it's not something I can really talk about with anyone. The last few times I trusted someone, it really went downhill. Besides, no one wants to read an essay about someone else's trivial problems.

I'm not enjoying anything that I normally enjoy, it's even ruining my job. I'm back home visiting family and still do not feel any joy what-so-ever. 

I honestly feel like I don't have any other option left than to take my life. I just don't know how I'm going to do it yet.",t2_4gfjqogw,10,0,0,"I'm ready to go I've struggled with mental illness for a long time. I was doing better, but recently I've just gotten to the worst point of my life.

i think im going to hang myself tonight,"ive been suicidal since before I was 13. I’ve never been able to have a real group of friends who truly care about me and I really, genuinely think that I never will no matter how hard i try. Im last year I felt completely alone and worthless. I only had my direct family to talk to bcs I just isolated myself in my room. at a point my family didn’t even want anything to do with me because my therapist was gonna call cps on my parents, even though I tried to defend them as much as I could. I truly just wanted to make my parents’ pain end and not be such a nuisance and burden on everyone around me. I started just,,hacking at my wrists every day with chisels and tools in my room, and at one point my dad even came into my room and caught me doing it and didn’t stop me, so that felt like encouragement to just end it. I was so close but i got a message from my now-ex boyfriend that day asking if I wanted to hang out. We already knew eachother but when we started hanging out we were instantly so close, and he made me feel so appreciated and not worthless. Plus I spent all of my time at his house so I didn’t have to deal with problems at home anymore. It felt like i was worth something to someone for once. I really thought he was saving me , like it was a divine intervention. 

For the past week or so my boyfriend had been telling me that me and my whole family is going to burn in hell. It came out of nowhere he was just suddenly constantly aggressive, insulting to me, and purposely disruptive in my house. He has bipolar disorder so i was just trying to help him get through the manic episode he was clearly going through. he has told me that I’m not a good enough Christian girl for him, and that my prayers sound like bullshit apparently, which has completely got my confidence down as I found God on my own, and he had been raised Christian, so it feels like someone who has way more knowledge than me on the subject is just telling me to give up my faith. 

It’s about a year after my last suicide attempt and my healed arms are covered in slashes again, a noose made from my xbox cord is hanging in my closet, my family just sees me as a burden more than before because I’m 18 now, and my ex boyfriend has made it clear to me that im worthless. 

He left my house a couple nights ago and he has continued to tell me things like “I hate you” and “i hope you enjoyed that mediocre dick you STUPID BITCH” even though he was the one I lost my virginity to, and ive never had sex with anyone else. He also keeps saying that my family is going to suffer and burn. And i know he’s been acting crazy, but since he started saying those things, my family has been going through so much shit. My dad walked out on us the other night and hasn’t come back at all, we had to call an ambulance and take my sister to the emergency room, my other sister keeps fighting with my mom, one of my dogs got injured and my dad has refused to bring her to the vet. i dont even wknow what to do because  i know hes crazy and i know my family isn’t going to hell, but things just keep happening and i feel like my whole life is falling apart. i reslly want to kill myself but I’m also afraid of going to hell , especially after everything

i have stood in my closet with the noose around my neck multiple times in the past few nights. I’m short enough that if I get off of my tip-toes and stand flat, I will die. it would be so easy

i feel like somehow i can make everything better if i just take myself out of the situation. it may hurt people at first but i ultimately feel like it would do more good for everyone i love than bad. I feel so worthless. I still love my ex. i cant stop feeling broken and alone right now. i can kill myself Right now. My family isn’t home and I can literally just walk into my closet and die right now. i almost wish my ex would just tell me to kill myself becsuse i wouldnt feel so bad doing it, or at least it would give me enough momentary courage to do it quickly .

i feel so stupid and worrhless even typing any of this im sorry if it’s incoherent or hard to read im jst kind of pouring everything out rn. ljust keep looking up things that might encourage me to end it and i figured i would make an attempt to ask for advice becsuse i dont feel like i can tell anyone that i care about how close i am to doing it",t2_5c89mzg2,17,0,0,"i think im going to hang myself tonight ive been suicidal since before I was 13.

I'm going to run away,"I've constantly had these feelings of running away from the life I've always known. Currently, I'm planning on becoming missing and commit suicide in an undisclosed location. Life has been a cruel joke at this point. I've suffered long enough. I'm tired of feeling like a foreigner. No matter where I go, I never belong. High school has been the worst four years of my life. I've been ostracized for the smallest things. I hate being considered the 'smart' kids. That label has been more of a curse than a blessing. I'm not seen as a person. Instead, I'm more like a score on a leaderboard that has to be overwritten. Whenever I make a mistake, I get put down and insulted often. In addition, I get slut-shamed for being sexually assaulted and berated with slurs. I constantly feel like a burden because people are annoyed by me and don't give a shit about how I feel. Life has always been fucking me over ever since I was born. My family would care less about me. The people who claim to 'care' about me are fake and shallow as hell. They say they want me to succeed, yet they expect me to fail. I hate my life and the shitty people in it. As a result, I'm constantly being exposed to a toxic environment at home and school.

I'm done trying to get better. There is no better for me.,"I'm 29.        

My whole life has been a struggle against myself and the things that have happened to me.         

I've been trying to get better. I've been trying. I really have. I've been in therapy for 6 years. Trying to fix myself. Trying to get better.         
 
And in some ways, I have. I'm less emotionally volatile now. Have a better grasp on my emotions, so they dont get out of hand.     
 
But underneath that? Underneath my breakdowns and explosions and meltdowns? What do I have?         

Emptiness. Self-hatred. Such strong, overwhelming, inescapable self-hatred. I **hate** myself. More than words could ever express. I feel so worthless, and hopeless, and tired, and I genuinely don't think it's ever going to get better. I dont think I will ever be able to live a meaningful life.         


I've been with my boyfriend for 10 years. I am a leech, stealing love from him because I have none to give myself. I am incapable of being okay with myself, so I seek love and validation from everyone else. And it is never enough. I need constant reassurance. I know it makes him tired. I know he is tired. I'm so sorry.                 


I have no job. I have no source of income. I'm turning 30 this year and I have done absolutely *nothing* to plan for myself or my future, because I have always lived under the assumption that there wouldn't be a future for me. I'm living off an inheritance, and I've got ~$2k left. I was on disability benefits before, because of my mental illness, and I'll have to reapply for it now. But it all seems so pointless.         


Why am I still here? Why do I keep going? Every single day, I wake up and feel overwhelmed by how much I hate myself. I feel hollow, and empty, and broken. I don't want to try to get better anymore. I don't want to try and be okay anymore. I just want to slip under the water and disappear.      


I don't feel like it's worth it anymore. I dont feel like *I'm* worth it anymore. I hate myself so much. I don't even want to try anymore. I don't want to go to therapy anymore. I don't want to try to get better anymore. There is no better. This is it. There's no escape from my self-hatred. It's consuming me. And I'm going to let it. I give up.

I don’t know what to do,"I dated a girl I was very much in love with, and after three months she was pregnant, the. For nine months we were so happy, then when our daughter was born she stopped being kind to me. Then her family started doing small things to bother me and make me want to go; then they did big things, like wake our daughter up 4 hours earlier than she liked to: just because I worked until midnight and was the only one who could watch her in the mornings.
Then I started hearing her family say made up stories about me from my girlfriend. I decided I couldn’t deal with them so I asked my girlfriend if we could look for apartment and move out. We did that and when we finished she said she wasn’t ready. Then she started treating me like shit and saying I was a bad parent no matter how good I did. Everyone I know was telling me I’m good and doing a good job; but the first person I loved was making me feel bad about myself. This went on for months, so then I started staying with my parents.
She drew me back in; saying she’d change, but it just stayed the same. We fully broke up the next time I tried living with my dad and driving over in the morning to pick up my daughter. This time she tried even harder to pull me in: and I gave in and when I did; she started acting like I didn’t exist. My texts would go unanswered for days, whenever I spent time with her and the baby, at most two times a week with our work schedule, she started the day mad, and would always do something super rude. I loved away a last time and we broke things off pretty amicably this time. But she still does things to make me feel bad: I tried talking to her and she said I’m making everything up about what her family did; and that I act like everything is someone else’s fault.
I know I’m not perfect, I admitted my mistakes and worked on them; but she was never willing to do the same: and her and her parents are a part of my life forever.
Today is the last morning I get to spend with my daughter: she’s too mature and Independent, spending time with her just makes me sad.

My bank accounts at zero because of stress eating and my ex being an expensive person to be with. I feel like my life was over. If we never had a baby I could move on and hope my next relationship is better; but nobody wants to date a 20 year old with a baby: a medium paying job with horrible hours, who’s last relationship ended like this. 
I just want to die and I know I have the confidence to do it which is what scares me. I just think my life is over. I still have so many people that love me, but my daughter I never see won’t be one and my first ever girlfriend who I loved and tried for more than anything and I never got anything back from won’t be one.

If we never had a baby I could move on and hope my next relationship is better; but nobody wants to date a 20 year old with a baby: a medium paying job with horrible hours, who’s last relationship ended like this. 
I just want to die and I know I have the confidence to do it which is what scares me. I just think my life is over. I still have so many people that love me, but my daughter I never see won’t be one and my first ever girlfriend who I loved and tried for more than anything and I never got anything back from won’t be one. And to make things worse before we dated she was a huge whore, and she’s going back out partying when she should be with our daughter, and I can’t stop myself from going online and seeing it everywhere. I just don’t want to be alive."
A reprieve from life,"Y’all ever just stop trying to fake it? Maybe I should call it fake it, cuz I mean it most of the time. I really do try to be happy and spread as much joy as I can, but it always ends up running me ragged. To a point where nothing helps, where I turn to drugs and harm. The amount of times that I’ve stared at the wall of my room completely void of all emotion, not just void of happiness but sadness too, Is ridiculous. I don’t think I’m depressed, I’ve seen depression and it’s horrible but I still function, and I still get through my day. I just feel like not me. I don’t feel anymore. So everynoe and then I’ll wrap an old belt without the buckle lock thing around my throat and just knock myself out. Those few moments of euphoria make the world a better place for me. And then I cry. I cry so fucking much when I wake up, and it feels good. I like it when I’m sad. I fucking love it. I revel in it cuz I’m finally feeling and I can do something. Sometimes I push myself till I’m dead on my feet, and then I just break. And I love it. I live for the moment when I can’t take it anymore and I just snap or break or cry.

I've been contemplating it for several years. I think today might be the last straw.,"I'm sorry to bore you all with my problems, but I guess I just need to vent and write this down somehow. The more I write the more pretentious and foolish I feel, cause I guess I still have enough self awareness to know that many, many others have had it worse. But I guess if I actually choose to do it, I'd love for someone to understand my situation at the end.

7 years ago, I went to Japan from Vietnam at the age of 18, carrying on my shoulder the hope and dreams of my family, especially my mother, who wants nothing more in her life than to see me succeed. I didn't have any dream then but I had hope, along with the curiosity and belief of a young mind that I can take on anything in this modern world. At first, it was fine, I was among my peers, my fellow foreign students who are all as naive and oblivious as the one next to them. That was, until 6 years ago when I left my friends in Tokyo and enrolled in a prestigious college in Osaka.

And now, here I am, 2 years over without being able to graduate, about to go on to 3. I faced all kinds of problems I never knew I would have trouble with. From a popular kid to a weird, unarticulated foreigners, I failed constantly to form a decent social relationship, I struggled and pretend to fit in but that also failed. I remembered I was so ashamed of my daily failures that I stopped talking to my family and friends, and ultimately shut myself in.

Two years ago, things started to turn around. My dear mother, despite me being the absolute failure of a son, found out about my address in Japan and she came right up to my doorstep herself, without being able to speak any Japanese or English. Then I met my Japanese girlfriend, who made me feel so good about myself, and it's all because of her that I got accepted to one of the largest pharmaceutical company in Japan. I thought nothing could go wrong from here...

But today, it did. I didn't have enough credit to graduate. 2, to be exact, or one single Math class. I don't even know what to say. Inside me there's just a black hole made out of shame and disappointment that seems to just be swelling up and consumes my everything until my total being is defined by it. Nothing but a pathetic, worthless losers. It's actually laughable, the whole thing, and that makes me want to end it even more. I now love my family and my girlfriend more than anything, myself included. I know me ending my life will destroy them, but oh man how it's tempting. I don't know if it's my inner selfish demon that's rationalizing, or even glorifying the act of suicide, but I just can't fathom anyone who would love a piece of shit like me again. I don't even like myself. I used to, which is the tragic part. But now it just seems like it was just a fool's gold, like the way that elephant looked to the blind man in the story.

Laugh at me, sympathize with me, pursuade me all you want. I can't stand the fact that if the school choose to put me through another whole year of tuition for me to relearn some equations that I'd never use again in my life, I'll choose a high building and jump off of it. Preferably at night so it won't cause a scene. Not much at least. I can't even imagine how I'd have the audacity to let my parents handle one more year of my tuition, let my girlfriend buy me stuff in our anniversary because I'm broke, or suffer on more sleepless night drowning in fear, anxiety and sorrow. 

Oh man, I'd do it in a heartbeat if I have no one who cares about me. I guess I'll wait until the 19th, it's the day the school will let me know if my score will be reevaluated or not. I don't even feel scared. This feeling like being stepped on 24/7, it will finally be relieved. If it comes to that, then I love you, mom and dad and my family. And you too, Risako.

An honest request for support,"I have reoccurring memories of being gang raped in a black Methodist church, after being sold to the church by my father. A heroin dealer in jail for killing someone .

I've been doing therapy for years, taking my meds, trying to find a reason to stay. But I just don't see the point anymore.
 
 I don't wanna hurt the people that care about me and I hope one day they'll understand why I have to do this.

I find happiness knowing that I can kill myself,"I'm not looking for attention but I'm looking for discussion.. whenever anything goes bad in life I stay content knowing I'm going to kill myself soon.

I lost my glasses while surfing 🏄‍♀️ how do I tell about it to my parents?,"ok well first my mom had always told me to remove my glasses whenever I go to swimming or to the beach and I never listened to that. I always wear it even when I take a shower cuz if I remove it, I see everything blurry.

so today we (me, my family &amp; our family friends) all went to a beach. we weren't expecting anything like surfing. in fact, it was my first time trying to surf.

after I got a surfing board, I went to the water with my glasses, even when my mom told me to remove it in case I lose it. I was like okay even though I did not care.

after I went a bit far with my surfing board, I got back to the board and was wiping the water off my glasses. while wiping, a wave came unexpectedly. 

after the wave, I started seeing everything blurry and noticed my glasses weren't there. I knew i can't find it now cuz it's the beach like if you lose a hair band, you can't find it. I was in the deep area too.

I got my glasses on November 2019 and I don't even know how to tell my parents about it. they are very strict and they will obviously scold me for losing my glasses.

this happened around 3-4 hours ago and I'm still thinking about this. I keep on thinking about this. what should I tell my parents?

few minutes ago, my mom asked me where my glasses are, and I said it's in my cosmetic box. she was like 🤨 cuz she knows I would never remove it. I see everything blurry right now. I can't see long distance and short distance both.

i have been thinking about this a lot. it makes me very sad. when I lose something, it makes me extremely sad 💔

I feel so hopeless. I feel like killing myself is the only way out.,"My family has abused me for years, and I am sick of it. I graduated recently, and my mother posted it in the family group chat, knowing that my siblings are jealous of my achievements despite being much older than me; true enough, my brother sent a condescending message and told me to ""Let past be past. Welcome to life past school."" I don't want to be gaslit here. It's difficult to understand the nuances of relationships, but it's just such an off message. And I thought - if I ever want to achieve my dreams and get ahead in life, I can never let my family know.

I want to run away. Even though I'm 23 and I should be able to go off on my own I *can't*. I don't have a bank account to my name because I keep getting rejected because my father is considered a politically exposed person internationally and by affiliation so am I. How am I supposed to get a visa if I can't prove my financial standing when I don't have a bank account? I just want a bank account where I can hide my savings from my parents because I don't know what they'd do. I need a visa because I just got accepted into grad school. I can't................... I'm tired. I'm so tired. It's not fair. I never chose to be born into that family. It's like nobody protects people like me.

When I told my parents about grad school, they were very hesitant. My mother kept making excuses like there's coronavirus in the state that I plan to study in despite there being more in my home country, that my parents want me to return to - despite the poor healthcare over there, and tries to steer the conversation about her illness. I know she's healthy and wants attention. Please believe me. I'm not crazy. My family is full of narcissists and I just want to get away. I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm glad that I didn't tell my parents about my grad school acceptances (with funding, thankfully) because just like what happened about my graduation, which was supposed to be a happy memory, they wanted to undermine it. I'm so sad that I was born into their family. I hate that growing up I was my mother's ""favorite,"" which turned my siblings, all of which are older than me by at least six years, against me. I hate my siblings for not being mature. I hate my family for not treating me with love. I hate my mother for wanting to sabotage my happiness and success. I hate my father for valuing his ego more than my wellbeing.

I want life to get better but I don't think that's possible for people like me with actual tangible barriers. I'm from a third world country where I'm so sheltered to the point that I'm too scared to leave my house and ride public transportation. I've gotten more used to living overseas than living in my country, but I can't go anywhere without a visa, and I need to prove my intent to leave the US once my master's has finished (I'm YET to go) but I don't have anything to use as proof. I can't even open a bank account because of my father's political background. Is there really nothing for me? I think if I try to play along with what my parents want, become the scapegoat of abuse and all the problems my dysfunctional family has for the next three years, I think I just might die.

I've got pills in one hand and my suicide letter in another.,"For reference, I'm 14. This isn't something with my hormones like everyone I've tried to go to had said, I've struggled for years and now that I tried to get help I realised there's nothing to look forward to. 

When my dad abandoned me and my mom, I first learnt to never lean on anyone. He left is with no money, support, nothing. My mom raised me for two years as a toddler on hey own, even hey parents didn't help us. I would always hear of a mother and father, but when I would always my mom where dad is, when he's coming home where would just drink more. It's currently gotten to the point where she's so drink I have to open her bottles and if I don't, I get punished. So, I've never had a stable adult figure. But back when I was five, she met by half brother's father, whose worse then my own. He would hard me for the color of my son as I'm mixed and they're both white. I would be yelled at, and hit at age 5 for something it off my own control. 

So, my mom tried clearing my skin. I still remember the singing pain almost ten years later and have scars all over my body. Then, my mom had my brother. He was their perfect child. Blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin, there was nothing he could do wrong. But I couldn't go near him, his father threatened to throw me against the wall of the apartment if I did, so almost everyday after kindergarten I would just sit in the corner of the living room and cry. Even he couldn't stay long though, when my brother was three months old about, he left is alone like my father did. So the three of us had to move into her mom's house, because she couldn't keep a job long with her addictions. 

You'd think it couldn't get worse, right? But no, the new living space caused me to move schools, where from grades 1-5 they would physically push me to the ground and make fun of me for my lost father and my brown skin. The same five girls. I couldn't escape my torture anywhere. They would make me five them the answers to a test, would or their hot food on me, and make fun of me for having to go in the free food line. 

Around two years ago, grade 6, my father finally reached out to me. I had no idea what he looked like even, the last time I'd ""seen"" him was when I was two. He fought for custody and got every other weekend. When I have to go over there, I see how he completely replaced what he had with my mom. He married a woman just I've year younger than my mom, with a child only did months younger. Since then they've been a constant reminder that I want enough for him. Like I'm not worth anything. It's been the biggest jab in my heart, more then him leaving in the first place. The woman makes snarky comments shit my hair, the way I dress, how I have ""no style"", no curves, I'm too tall, anything that she can think of to crush my soul when I'm there.

Now, I've lived in this cycle of harassment from my brother (he gets it from his dad that he sees every other week), kids at school, my dad's wife. But I found a guy my age last year that my neighbor. He wanted to date me, and even though I though we were to young the though of someone caring about me made me his ""girlfriend"". That was year 7. Since then, he's done things like touch me in my personal areas, and tried going all the way. He scares me, but I'm afraid of him, but afraid to leave one of the only people that ""cares"" about me, even if it's fake. 

I just can't anymore. Goodbye. 👋",t2_5vvr0cbo,4,0,0,"I've got pills in one hand and my suicide letter in another. For reference, I'm 14. This isn't something with my hormones like everyone I've tried to go to had said, I've struggled for years and now that I tried to get help I realised there's nothing to look forward to. 

When my dad abandoned me and my mom, I first learnt to never lean on anyone. He left is with no money, support, nothing. My mom raised me for two years as a toddler on hey own, even hey parents didn't help us. I would always hear of a mother and father, but when I would always my mom where dad is, when he's coming home where would just drink more. It's currently gotten to the point where she's so drink I have to open her bottles and if I don't, I get punished. So, I've never had a stable adult figure. But back when I was five, she met by half brother's father, whose worse then my own. He would hard me for the color of my son as I'm mixed and they're both white. I would be yelled at, and hit at age 5 for something it off my own control. 

So, my mom tried clearing my skin. I still remember the singing pain almost ten years later and have scars all over my body. Then, my mom had my brother. He was their perfect child. Blonde hair, blue eyes, pale skin, there was nothing he could do wrong. But I couldn't go near him, his father threatened to throw me against the wall of the apartment if I did, so almost everyday after kindergarten I would just sit in the corner of the living room and cry. Even he couldn't stay long though, when my brother was three months old about, he left is alone like my father did. So the three of us had to move into her mom's house, because she couldn't keep a job long with her addictions. 

You'd think it couldn't get worse, right? But no, the new living space caused me to move schools, where from grades 1-5 they would physically push me to the ground and make fun of me for my lost father and my brown skin. The same five girls. I couldn't escape my torture anywhere. They would make me five them the answers to a test, would or their hot food on me, and make fun of me for having to go in the free food line. 

Around two years ago, grade 6, my father finally reached out to me. I had no idea what he looked like even, the last time I'd ""seen"" him was when I was two. He fought for custody and got every other weekend. When I have to go over there, I see how he completely replaced what he had with my mom. He married a woman just I've year younger than my mom, with a child only did months younger. Since then they've been a constant reminder that I want enough for him. Like I'm not worth anything. It's been the biggest jab in my heart, more then him leaving in the first place. The woman makes snarky comments shit my hair, the way I dress, how I have ""no style"", no curves, I'm too tall, anything that she can think of to crush my soul when I'm there.

Now, I've lived in this cycle of harassment from my brother (he gets it from his dad that he sees every other week), kids at school, my dad's wife. But I found a guy my age last year that my neighbor. He wanted to date me, and even though I though we were to young the though of someone caring about me made me his ""girlfriend"". That was year 7. Since then, he's done things like touch me in my personal areas, and tried going all the way. He scares me, but I'm afraid of him, but afraid to leave one of the only people that ""cares"" about me, even if it's fake. 

I just can't anymore. Goodbye. 👋"
"Sorry again, but i have no one","Ive been posting a lot here lately, and i might feel like im nagging, but its my only pitlet and i have to write this out. Maybe someone reads it, maybe not.

Im constantly thinking about death. How it would be better to me, because i cant get a job, because of the ways i struggle in life, because im a failure in this society. I hate the world for how it is, because i cant work with it - i cant function in it. Its not made for weak people like me. 

I honestly just want to dissapear, i probably would be happy if i lived alone on an island - but i cant do that now can i. Nothing is gonna make me happy, and they say these are the happiesrt years of our lives, anf i just read an article saying it doesnt really get better, it gets worse. And im cring right now. I cant do that, i cant get a will to live knowing it gets worse, it gets harder. I cry every fucking day, my heart tears everyday. And then it tears some more because i think of how hard its gonne be to die, because honestly i dont want to kill myself. Its torture, i dont want it. But im gonna have to, because i do not want to live. Im such a burden in this world and honestly who wants to be that? 
No one, thats who.

Im sick of everyone telling me to get a therapist, im sick of everything. I have no fucking joy. I spend my days waiting for my fucking ex of several months to text me cause thats is the only friend i have. And everything in me know i dont want to be his friend and we shouldnt even be talking or seeing each other, but i know how destoryed i would be if i put a stop to it. 

The heartbreak i have been through, me whole life, has made me who i am today. I am broken. I am destoryed. 
I want him, i dont want him. 
I want to be happy, but i dont want to live.
I cant anymore, how am i gonna kill myself? Thats the biggest question now, i be going around wondering that constantly. If only my family knew i thought about death everyday. they dont, they wont, they dont even care. No one tells me they love me, or that they care about me, and no one shows it other than my ex sometimes. 
What the fuck is wrong with me? Everything. What the fuck is up with this bullshit? Why am i this stupid? Such a fucking idiot, no one would be caught in my shoes, ever.

Suicide Cycle?,"This is my first time posting in a forum and it's weird, but I guess I just want to vent a little...
I just feel empty...
My brother killed himself 2/5 years ago, he was 30. I realistically know it's not my fault, but I feel kind of guilty for not being able to find him in time. I've been to therapy, but I still feel guilty. There was so much I could have done. For the past two years I've been quite ok with this, his death I mean. I thought I could just power through, I kept busy with work and other things and I kept a very strict routine, so I wouldn't fall into a rabbit hole. But since the beginning of this year I feel like I'm letting everything fall apart. The other day I just realized how empty and lonely I feel. I'm not technically lonely, I have my husband, my parents and my older brother, but still. I feel like something else is missing. I've also realized that since he died I haven't been able to create any bonds with other people. I feel like I'm an alien, so disconnected from everyone else, does anyone else feel like this?  
I feel like I've already lived the best part of my life, soon my parents will die too and I don't feel like going through more deaths, to be honest. I had a pretty good life, but I'm starting to think that it is enough. But then I start to think about my family and I don't want them to go through this again. I don't want to create a vicious cycle of suicide. But I feel kinda hopeless...

"I thought that after your first suicide attempt, you'd realize suicide want the answer? 20y/o Female","In 2016 I attempted suicide. I went to school and took some old Tylenol pills i had in my backpack. The only close friend I had at the time was the only person I told what I would be doing. It was such a surreal feeling taking pills in the hall right beside my classroom, taking a sip of water by the water fountain with every pill I took. Because I was scared, i went slow at first. I took two pills and greeted a friend who walked passed me on their way to our first class. I took two more and paused to think about what I was doing. I decided that I already committed and wanted to do it. I took 4 more. Soon after, the bell rang and it was time for my 9AM class. That day in class (it was my Jazz Performance class), we had a practice day so everyone broke off into groups and went to practice rooms to work on some pieces we would be playing for our upcoming concert. I waited and nothing happened in the first 20 minutes. I had not researched what would happened if I overdosed on pills- I preferred not to know. While waiting for the worst to happen, I clutched my violin and walked into the room where my current crush and moral/religious inspiration was, practicing piano. I didn't say much and I cant remember everything i said, but I had asked him if God forgave people after they committed a sin. He told me thats not how it works. To wrap up, my friend told the school consular and I was taken out of class and taken to the hospital to treat me for the pills I took.

When all this happened, eventually I regretted it and i ended up meaning my current fiance. But, lately life has been so pointless and meaningless. I dont know what I am doing wrong.

\-If i ask my parents for therapy, they always reply with ""You need God."" or tell me to go to church. (still live with parents)

\-I have become so unmotivated that I cant stream (im a streamer on twitch), I can barely get the motivation to go to school, do any homework, study, take care of myself, practice good hygiene, doll myself up etc

\-Im failing all of my college classes and If i withdraw, I will have another 3k to pay for the classes I drop which I cant pay

\-I am still paying off my last suicide attempt for my medical bills on top of 2 other medical bills (totaling about 3k), but I can barely pay it off because I am a full time student and a part time employee at a non-profit organization meaning that my pay is really low.

\-I do bad socially so I do not have any friends as all except my fiance

\-my fiance leaves to go to the airforce soon, leaving em with no one left to interact with or to feel emotional relief

Want to KMS because the way my body looks,"I have a very ""womanly"" body. Not feminine, but the kind of body that media makes fun of as the like fat angry butch lesbian whose ugly and manish. I'm only 20 years old and I havnt looked like a young girl since i was like 10 years old when my chest started growing. People used to compliment me for looking so mature and tall and ect for my age, and I was always expected to act more maturely because of it. Now that I'm in college youd think other people would have caught up to me, but I still look like I'm way older than everybody else around me. 

I have to see all these skinny fit girls who are enjoying their youth and beauty while I literally resemble my aunt who is like 60. 


I want to cut off my D cup sized breasts entirely but I dont have any money and insurance coverage is super hard to get but I seriously think I will kill myself if they stay on my body because they make me look so fucking horrible and I feel so insecure when they're noticable.

I tend to wear XL t shirts to hide my chest but makes the rest of me look fat too and I just want to be attractive for once in my life but you cant change how your fucking face was born so I guess I'll just kill my self",t2_4o1owbez,3,0,0,"Want to KMS because the way my body looks I have a very ""womanly"" body.

Is there simply a way not to participate?,"I wish there was. But I just can't see any. I'm like a lot of you I constantly bounce into the zone of not wanting to be alive whatsoever

To precieve existence is torture

To know you'll live, work, and function within the world you were forcefully made in for many upon many decades with no option besides ending it is heart breaking 

I try to be passionate about things but all my aspirations get rut over by monotony and boredom and soon meaninglessness. I haven't attended class in so many days, man I've probably already been suspended by now anyways. 

I don't enjoy anything. Not more than nothing anyways. I don't wanna exist and my birth was a crime

Help please,"My now ex wife cheated on me and lied to me and ran off with my daughter. I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I lost my job because i was arrested driving my drunk girlfriend home and the tire on her car blew out in the freeway. I wasn't drunk but was arrested for a dui because the cop lied and said i refused a blood test. Dealing with all the stress has kept me in a pretty depressed state lately and my gf decided she was done with dealing with me and my court stuff and broke up with me. 

I have no money, no job, my student loans are in default so i can't go back to school. The only reason me and my now ex gf survived was because her dad pretty much paid our rent. It took her a year to finally see a therapist and psychiatrist that she had talked about since i met her.

Feeling awful since 2016," 

I just feel awful all the time, I don't even hang out with anyone at this point.

I always self doubt my anxiety, depression and self concious issues but I know they're a constant. to me every day since I remember. I don't know if it was one thing that caused it or what, but I know something is deeply, deeply wrong with me.

I think it might have started to get really bad around 4 years ago. The place I was in caused me to have mental breakdowns and cry myself to sleep, but i'd doubt the situation I was in. I think this is why I cannot cry anymore, unless i'm yelling at people. The only time I can cry is when I yell at people, for some reason. I think its because my parents used to fight a lot, and still do, or something.

I really, really badly want to kill myself. I don't even bother talking to the one person who probably cares, cause they're dealing with stuff right now, and its awkward. It wouldn't help in the first place. I want desperately to go do stuff with friends in real life but I don't hang out with any of my ""friends"" outside of school.

People were talking about each other nicely on social media, and when the people who are my ""friends"" didn't mention me. They all mentioned each other saying nice stuff, but not me, so i'm pretty sure i'm not really their friends. If that's the case I only literally have one online friend.

I lost the motivation to do anything real and even play games I enjoy. My grades have dropped. I'm thinking about suicide all the time.",t2_2fj34s,7,0,0,"Feeling awful since 2016

My Mom Superstitions,"Since I was little my mother has told me of her superstition of seeing a black crow and having it look at her when someone she loves is going to die. It wouldn’t caw or make a noise, just turn to her and sit for a short time. She told me this never freaked her out or scared her she just knew and waited to hear the news. It’s early this morning and I’m in the parking lot of a store stocked up on my favorite drugs hoping to overdose. A few seconds before I’m ready to back out of the parking spot I see a crow. It sits on top of the shopping cart return section in the parking lot and it just sits. Strange to me but I don’t think anything of it. I get back to my house with the feeling of ultimate nothingness. When my phone rings. My mother. I haven’t spoke to her in a time because I recently wrecked my car. Not as a suicide attempt it was truly an accident one where I wasn’t injured but totaled my car. Her as well as my dad weren’t concerned with me at all. Just the car so I just wasn’t really speaking to them. I’m 19 and moved out about a month ago. Anyway I get a call at about 8am. She tells me she’s sitting on the couch (this is strange in itself for she doesn’t usually wake until about 11 or later) she said she was having bad dreams that I had hurt myself. She didn’t specifically say of a suicide just that I took my life. She called and apologized for her behavior. My heart is having stabbing pains. I haven’t taken these drugs. Still want to.

I think a friend of mine may have just killed herself.,"I know her from Twitter. She lived in the UK. I never met her IRL. Never even saw a photo of her. I'd been noticing her getting worse for weeks, starting when she privated her account, and tried to help her, but she just kept declining.

I tried to message her after I saw that. Several times. She has the thing where I'll be able to tell if she read my messages off. She hasn't responded. I know it's late over there but I'm still really worried.

I feel really guilty. I should have helped more. Tried to help her out more. Been less of a selfish dipshit. I reported all the suicide tweets I saw to Twitter. No idea if that'll help any.

I legit cried in the shower afterwards. I also unironically prayed for the first time in over a decade. I have to hold back my tears now. I don't know why I feel this way, I didn't even know her that well.

I sent her the suicide hotline thing beforehand already. Is there anything else I can do? Anything? Please...

I'm sorry.,"I've learned that there's no way to stop this feeling.
You just don't know what to do to make them happy, to stop being annoying. Cause no matter what you do they will be always unhappy, they won't appreciate what you do. They will always tell you that you're wrong and they are right. You have no voice, no opinion, you exists but at the price of doing whatever they tell ya to do. 
It's so tiring to trying to live up to their expectations.
You must be so tired of everything, everyone, even yourself.
There's nothing you can do. You'll always feel bad, useless, worthless, boring, dumb, and so many horrible things that you think about yourself because people don't seem to be satisfied with what you do, with the way you are.
They want you to be like they tell you to.
You can't be yourself, not even once, and it's so fucking tiring. 
I'm so tired of everything.
This is so selfish. I wish I wasn't like this. I can't never be fine with myself and no one can stand me. 
And i can't even stop being so stupid even when the only person that cares about me tells me that they are there for me.

You just don't know what to do to make them happy, to stop being annoying. Cause no matter what you do they will be always unhappy, they won't appreciate what you do. They will always tell you that you're wrong and they are right. You have no voice, no opinion, you exists but at the price of doing whatever they tell ya to do. 
It's so tiring to trying to live up to their expectations.
You must be so tired of everything, everyone, even yourself.
There's nothing you can do. You'll always feel bad, useless, worthless, boring, dumb, and so many horrible things that you think about yourself because people don't seem to be satisfied with what you do, with the way you are.
They want you to be like they tell you to.
You can't be yourself, not even once, and it's so fucking tiring. 
I'm so tired of everything.
This is so selfish. I wish I wasn't like this. I can't never be fine with myself and no one can stand me. 
And i can't even stop being so stupid even when the only person that cares about me tells me that they are there for me. 
I'm sorry I can't stop being like this.
I'm sorry I cry a lot for almost everything.
I'm sorry I'm always being so blue and sad.
I'm sorry i can't be a good and caring partner.
I'm sorry I've never been the daughter you wished to have, mom.
I'm sorry I haven't die.
I'm sorry I didn't let myself die in the fire that started in our department.
I'm sorry I keep on living.
I'm sorry for being so weak.
Sorry for trying to not be like this but keeping on it.
sorry my precious and wonderful darling for promising to stop being like this but getting back at it...
I'm so sorry for being such a crybaby.
Sorry for writing a lot, I don't wanna bother you by telling you this so i write here. 
Sorry.
I love you."
I’m gonna kill myself tomorrow night,"i only have two friends in college. I’m slowly growing apart from them because I can’t go to parties or hang out with them when their other friends are around (I have social anxiety disorder). So I’m by myself literally all the time. And when I am with my friends they often talk about things that happened at parties or while they were hanging out without me, which isn’t bad, but it really makes me feel like complete shit.i don’t have anything to offer in my friendships. All I bring is negativity and bad energy and constant problems and whining. Nobody wants a friend like that. Nobody wants a friend who can’t go out with them and can’t even be around other people. 

I’m tired of being alone. I realized that I’ve never really had a friend that I’ve felt really comfortable with in my whole life because I’m always worried about saying the wrong thing.

It’s patronizing and I feel embarrassed that I’m such a fucking loser that I need help learning how to be a person.  I don’t like meds because I hate myself because I’m such an obnoxious person, and when I feel less anxious I have less of a filter and I get more obnoxious.

I’m so fucking tired of this and there’s no way out. No matter how much treatment I get, I will never be normal.

GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS BODY

I won't kid myself, I guess I'm just not trying hard enough, it's probably a combination of that plus me not being important enough to anyone to merit assistance in getting the help I really need. Some days suicide does seem like the only viable option. 

Do you know what it's like to not be able to use public bathroom stalls? To not fit in the driver's seat of your own car? To not be able to physically go anywhere and find clothes that fit you? To be devalued and marginalized for the way you look at EVERY TURN since childhood? Do you know what it's like to always be looked at by strangers and loved ones alike with combined pity and disgust? Do you know what it's like to want to get better so much, but to do it you'll have to fight against the most effective INSTINCTIVE COPING SKILL you've ever had? 

Couple all that with looking around me at people who say they love me but refuse even to offer to help despite my asking? Some don't know how or can't, but from here it looks like I have no loved ones, except for my mom, Thomas, and my brother probably. If no one who cares wants to help me get this gastric bypass then I just don't see any other way but death at this point, cause that's where I'm headed anyway.

Maybe in 50 years or so when insurance companies learn that it's better to just help people with this then let us suffer for so long we choose the easy way out someone will still be able to look back and realize what happened to me. That I felt I had no choice and not a single person in the world that could help me would stand beside me, a fellow human. Maybe someone will finally see all of you for what you truly are.

I am done with other humans. I done with pretending. I'm done watching you enjoy your cruises and vacations, throwing away money that could literally save my fucking life at this point. For these reasons, I can no longer stand to Fakebook. I will not be dead, for now, but I want to die, and many of you have held a daily part in that thanks to social media. You won't see me here, anymore. If I have to do this alone, none of you deserve to watch me succeed.

I think I'm done,"I've (23m) spent the last five years living in poverty with an old childhood friend (23M). He was orphaned right before he turned 18 and spent a year homeless before we reconnected and moved in together. He's been struggling with severe PTSD from it, and at times was doing worse than I am now. My fiance (22F) also moved in with us when she finished high school, throwing away any plans for college in doing so. We've been struggling for years, both financially and mentally. I was the primary breadwinner between the three of us, and was able to avoid several attempts at taking my life by convincing myself that I was needed. 

Now I feel like I can finally rest. My roommate's mental health has drastically improved, to where he wants to go to college and start living on his own. He's even considering getting a loan and moving into a dorm! As for my fiance, she's been given the opportunity to work on her dream job, where she'll be making more than the three of us make now combined. They're both better off without me, and I mean that in an objective way. My fiance and I are poly, and I've developed feelings for my roommate. My roommate and I have actually talked about this before, where he said he had no romantic interests in us whatsoever. Despite that, three years have passed and the feelings persisted. He doesn't need someone like that in his life, especially when he inevitably meets someone in college and falls in love. I frankly think it'll be torture watching someone you can't shake feelings for fall in love with someone else. And as for my fiance, she has dreams and aspirations, unlike me. We even joked that with all the money she'll make, I can be a househusband. I have no hobbies or real skills, which means I'll just be bored out of my mind for the rest of my life.

I think it's best to end it on a semi high note. I have ammonia and bleach in my car, I hear it's relatively painless to just keep the mixture next to you and just fall asleep.

"I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom, but somehow I’ve still manage to fall deeper (transgender)","I haven’t ever felt this suicidal in my whole life. I just want to be seen as a normal human being. 
Hello, I’m transgender female to male. I haven’t had anything medical done and I’m in high school. 

The dysphoria and discomfort of not feeling okay in my own skin is so overwhelming, I can’t take it anymore. I need something to change.. but I’ve done everything possible in order to pass that I know of. I’ve spent hours looking online for something I’ve missed; some secret that guys do in order to actually be seen as a guy. 
I’ve started going to a support group and although it did give me hope, it’s also made me feel even worse. There’s this one guy there who’s already 5 years through his transition, I’m so envious. 
All I’ve been able to think about this past two months is how many different ways I can hurt myself and utilize the objects around me. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve thought about jumping out of my car while doing 60-70 down the interstate. 
The only reason I’m still alive is because of my family, otherwise I would have killed myself three/four years ago. I know this place isn’t necessarily for transgender rants, but I don’t know where else to put it without it getting taken down before I can get any real feedback. 

I’m 5’2, I have an undercut and my hair is longer on top. All my clothes are men’s, I wear boxers, my chest is semi flat (even without the binder) and I have masculine mannerisms. I’ve trained my voice to be deeper, but it’s still so fucking feminine. If it wasn’t for my voice I probably wouldn’t be misgendered. I’m so depressed, my medication just keeps going up and I’m still depressed. I have mental breakdowns regularly. I don’t sleep much, or I over sleep. I either don’t eat or eat on and off. I’m antisocial and awkward. I have absolutely no friends, and I just started at a new school a month ago. 
I tried getting my teachers to call me he/him even at the cost of using my birth name, but I have to get parents permission. I want to start testosterone, but I need both parents signature. My father isn’t even in the picture, and my mother thinks it’ll all go away over time. 

I haven’t cut in almost a year, but that’s all that’s ran through my mind in the last few hours. I self harm often, but never draw blood or really leave a mark.

I'm just a burden on society. I should just end my suffering,"I've suffered severe depression for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was constantly bullied at secondary school. 

I've been diagnosed with plain simple depression. Not that there's anything plain simple about depression, it feels pretty complicated and horrible to me. Even if others think that there's no such illness and I should stop being depressed.

I would if I could, but it's not like there's a switch is there? 

The last few weeks have been so mentally fatiguing. I'm mentally drained and losing my fight with depression. I feel the darkness engulf more and more with each passing day. 

Will I wake up tomorrow? I hope not, as it will be yet another pointless struggle against pointless mediocrity. I have lost interest in everything apart from going back to bed. But my sleep is constantly disrupted. I can't win. 

Finally reached out to people who I thought were friends. Turns out they were bullies as well. They take great delight and joy from my pain and misery. Now they've realised I'm an emotional wreck, there nasty comments are all I think about. 

I think everyone feels this way, and everyone is right. I should just kill myself and stop being such a pollutant burden on everyone, and to society. 

Why can't I be happy like the people I see
Why aren't they suffering too
What even is happiness 

Society doesn't want me. No one wants me. Whats the point in life when everything is so needlessly complicated all the time. Why are people so hard to understand 

Earlier I took a load of antidepressants. It turns there's slim to no chance of overdosing this way. So another disappointment

I've been diagnosed with plain simple depression. Not that there's anything plain simple about depression, it feels pretty complicated and horrible to me. Even if others think that there's no such illness and I should stop being depressed.

I would if I could, but it's not like there's a switch is there? 

The last few weeks have been so mentally fatiguing. I'm mentally drained and losing my fight with depression. I feel the darkness engulf more and more with each passing day. 

Will I wake up tomorrow? I hope not, as it will be yet another pointless struggle against pointless mediocrity. I have lost interest in everything apart from going back to bed. But my sleep is constantly disrupted. I can't win. 

Finally reached out to people who I thought were friends. Turns out they were bullies as well. They take great delight and joy from my pain and misery. Now they've realised I'm an emotional wreck, there nasty comments are all I think about. 

I think everyone feels this way, and everyone is right. I should just kill myself and stop being such a pollutant burden on everyone, and to society. 

Why can't I be happy like the people I see
Why aren't they suffering too
What even is happiness 

Society doesn't want me. No one wants me. Whats the point in life when everything is so needlessly complicated all the time. Why are people so hard to understand 

Earlier I took a load of antidepressants. It turns there's slim to no chance of overdosing this way. So another disappointment 

Failure in life failure at death
I can't do this anymore 
Let the bullies win 
Kill myself 
At least then someone will be victorious"
My family has accepted that I want to kill myself,"24M. Severely depressed since 12. After a year and a half of screaming/crying/wailing for hours on end to everyone in my household almost every day, my parents have verbally expressed, when I mention I want to kill myself (every day as well), that if that’s what I want to do, then that’s my choice, and that they would miss me if I do but that their lives will not stop because I am gone. While this makes me sad to hear, it is also reassuring to know that my parents would be able to heal and get past my death if I do decide to go through with it. Doesn’t make me feel as guilty.

I'm ready to end my life.,"I have no family left at all. My mom died almost 2 years ago. She was the last family member I had. At the time of my mother's death I was dating a girl I thought was going to become my wife. She talked about the kids we would have and what our house would look like. She planned all these trips together for us. I never had someone talk so much about how much they wanted to be with me. I caught her cheating on about a week before my mom died. My now exgirlfriend was sleeping with another guy. Completely lost interest in me as soon as my mom was hospitalized and never even had the courage to tell me she was sleeping with someone else. A week later I buried my mom. I gave a eulogy to a bunch of empty chairs because no one bothered to show up. While that was going on the girl I once loved was half way across another state dropping her panties for another guy. 

Now she's married to a different guy. She's pregnant by this new guy and starting a family with him. I was robbed of the grieving time I should have had over my mom. I have no one in this world. The only shoulder I can cry on I have to pay for. This is justice. This is what they call karma.

i don't think anyone takes me seriously anymore.,"hi, i made this account in hopes of finding support or advice or, i don't know, solace? feeling heard?

i'm 23 years old and have been having suicidal thoughts for 14 years. i guess i didn't realize how much of an issue it *still* was, as i'd stopped harming myself back in high school and have lived a mostly functional life, until this past august when i mentioned to my therapist that i thought about it all day, every day. it's hard to describe, though, because it's not like all of those thoughts are me actively *wanting* to die, but since it's been such a constant thing since i was nine years old, it's kind of just become a routine background thought process. 

since then, we've been working to lessen the frequence with which i have suicidal ideation and it's working, but i still deal with it from time to time and reach out to some trusted sources (my girlfriend, therapist, mom, and/or some closer friends) when it gets dangerous. 

the problem, however, is that i don't think anyone takes me seriously when i talk about wanting to kill myself or having different methods in mind to follow through with the idea. sometimes, it sort of feels like the person i'm talking to responds like, ""oh, i'm sorry :("" and then changes the subject or doesn't respond further. i should make it clear that because i've always worried this would happen, i make sure the occasions in which i reach out to these trusted sources are *very* few and far between; somewhere in the ballpark of ~ten times a year. most of these people also have a copy of a list my therapist helped me come up with in order to help dissuade me from taking action when in a crisis situation and have agreed to use some of the prompts/questions/reminders within the list but default to, ""that sucks /:"" when i try to talk to them about this. 

i've done everything possible to make sure the people i reach out to are comfortable with handling this subject matter and feel equipped to offer the support i need when it happens, but lately it just feels like no one believes me and therefore i should follow through with it so they know i was being serious. situations like these seem to exacerbate my suicidal ideation.

I just want the pain to end.,"I have my life together for the most part. Good job, nice place etc but I'm in so much pain  physically.  I should be grateful but I cant enjoy anything while every fiber of my being hurts. I've been to almost every kind of doctor out there and nobody knows what's wrong. People think I'm faking it. I'm tired of being told to suck it up. I cant stop thinking that if I die then the pains would end. I've exhausted every option. I dont want to kill myself but I dont wanna keep on the way I am.

I am tired. Physically. Mentally. I just want this to stop. I want to fade into nothingness. I have no energy and no fight left. What if it is all in my head? What if I'm just a weakling?

I cant stop thinking that if I die then the pains would end. I've exhausted every option. I dont want to kill myself but I dont wanna keep on the way I am.

I am tired. Physically. Mentally. I just want this to stop. I want to fade into nothingness. I have no energy and no fight left. What if it is all in my head? What if I'm just a weakling?

Nobody from the internet,"I’m not really feeling great recently to be honest. I’m probably just a nobody on the internet for you, but hey, hear me out. 

I don’t really wanna live anymore. I feel like everyday is a pain. I’m seventeen.

Back when I was 13, my mother died of cancer while I was in a intensive exam week at school. Of course, I thought I was strong and all, I don’t need to see someone. Now I regret it. But what I regret the most is I didn’t said goodbye to her. I changed school, for one year. I was at one of the best schools, and now I’m in one of the worst. The next year, I changed schools, again. I got heartbroken at my birthday, so now try to have a nice birthday for the next years... I got used by people for 2 years, my heart was shifting everywhere. So I got even more heartbroken.

And now here I am, in my last year of high school. My dad left Canada to go to Australia with my 9 years old brother, and I’m alone here. Everytime that I try to get up on my feet and be happier, I just go back down even deeper. I just don’t feel like continuing having failures again and again. All I’m asking is to have a family, and somehow, life took it away from me. I’m just posting this, because maybe someone can understand me.

It was my family's comments that made me feel too scared and stupid to drive today.

Vicious Circle,"I've been thinking about ending my life, but everything seems so painful. This is not the US, so it's not that easy to get a gun (what I think it might be the fastest way and convince myself that with one I'd be gone in a second) and I don't want anything gruesome either.

What kept me going for a few days was Prozac without prescription. I don't have a job to pay for therapy or anything. In those prozac weeks I felt like eating optimistic pills.

"How to make a mess from your own, perfectly fine life","I feel like that could have been a great life, full of things that people call ""success"", full of joy and other emotions. I'm 18 and looking at my situation somebody would say that it looks perfect. I'm in last year of high school, going to study violin in Switzerland which is regarded as a great success in my country. 

And that everything means nothing to me now, just because somewhere along those ride I went too deep in philosophy. It made me feel different in many ways. I don't have similar and even acceptable views on morality, human interactions, and nearly any other aspect of social life. You could say, that most of the time my positions are well though out (though not necessarily right) but what does it all matter, if it means that it is immensely hard to find any companion for a satisfying talk? Of course it would not be a problem if there was no drive for social interactions.

And so begins my worst everyday nightmare. The fight between primal drives, and what my brain decided is rational and best for me in the long run. 

Every time I meet with friends I do this just to get my instinct satisfied. I almost never feel later that it was a time well spent. That feeling after meeting with someone is very rare, but it happens every time I get to talk about philosophy, sociology, science and other topics like that. To that I have to add my sexual drive, which especially gets me mad. It makes me run after people that I have almost nothing in common, and that could never make me truly happy, just because I haven't have sex for some time now. 

I feel sick, deprived from normal look on the world, full of expectations that I'm struggling to meet, which only drives me to more self hatred. I suffer from genetic skin desease that makes me ugly. I don't know how to talk to people on anything not-serious anymore. I hate myself for wanting any romantic relationship. I wish I was asexual.

 Because of no problems earlier in my life I don't even know if I can write here and be taken seriously with such pitiful bumps, existing really only in my head, but I just want any help, any indication of what should I do now. Continue my struggle to become a man from my imagination even though psychology says it cannot be done or what? I feel like not going this way would be a failure of the entire life.

A Note,"I've dealt with depression for at least 5 years now. I tried everything I could on my own to feel better: eating well, working out, good sleep schedule, etc. Nothing worked. I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much. I now switched to computer science, I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me, but I'm still so unhappy. It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor, as I didn't want to worry my parents about it. But finally I did, a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti-depressant (Lexapro). I was so so hopeful that this would help me, but unfortunately things only got worse and worse. These past 2 months have been the absolute worst months of my life. I'm failing classes (because I missed so many lectures/assignments), I have no money, no job, I've isolated myself so much, I just feel like I can't do anything. I now feel as if I've exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don't know what I can do anymore...

I have no desire to be in this world anymore. I feel like I'm just not cut out for it, and I'm okay with that. There's so many other people out there, my life is so small and meaningless anyway, so what's it matter? It sadly doesn't seem like it's worth all the trouble anymore. And so many people have depression nowadays, it's so sad. I just fucking hate it here.

The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things. I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave.

Well if anyone actually read this, thanks. I've been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I've been feeling but I feel like I can't put all this weight on their shoulders.

And honestly, I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying. But I don't think I even have the desire to do that anymore. It doesn't seem worth it, I just want out.

stuck,"I'm stuck

There was a point in my life where I really wanted to die. 

Now, I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I live a relatively privileged life. My family is kind, I have good friends, I go to a privileged school. I get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. The world around me is beautiful. But I don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling like I wanted to die. No idea why. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no mental illnesses that I know of. I just hated my soul. Not myself. I hated the being I had created. I was in pain. I am a very appreciative person. And that has become my downfall. I appreciate the world around me so much that I have diminished myself as a human being. I love everything. And I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling continued for a long time. But now I have reached a point where I realized that I am not worthy of feeling sad. That I am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. Because I am privileged and I am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sad, then I feel angry, then I feel depressed, then I feel suicidal, then I feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then I want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I were to kill myself, I would cause so much pain to all the people around me. They would think I was selfish to do that. Do i really exist just to please other people? Am I just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. Then I sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. Because I'm not supposed to be sad. I'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was never born. Then I could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. Because I was never there in the first place. But now I'm stuck here. I only matter when I want to leave. Otherwise, I'm meaningless. But perhaps I shouldn't pity myself. After all, that would be awfully selfish of me.

What if I could pull this off,"I am tired of being stuck, tired of not being the person I know I could be. I am trying really hard not to make this another negative post. For the last 2 years or so I just stayed the same person. Sometimes I can't even tell if I am depressed or not because I don't have feelings, I have anhedonia and have a hard time even enjoying my favorite music. I barely exist, I pretend everything is okay because I get ignored when I am open about my feelings because no one around me knows how to help me. I wake up and want to go back to sleep again because I am constantly exhausted and want to escape reality. No one is taking me seriously, they belittle me because I don't study or have a job. They can't see themselves doing what I am about to do. I have all these wonderful visions and I know that someday they turn into reality. 

For once let's not focus on what is going wrong, let's find a way to get out of this and improve. I have nothing to lose if I decide to take baby steps into the right direction. I think the reason many people fail is because they want to solve too many problems at once or because they don't know where to start. I want to change one area of my life before I move to the next. I know that I am not able to go to the gym, eat healthy, meditate and all that shit at once so I won't do that. I want to minimize the chance of me going back to bad habits.

I waste a lot of time on my pc so the first step would be to unplug my monitor and place the cables somewhere in the basement. In my situation simply going down there to get everything I need to use my pc again is already too much work. Turning on my pc after waking up was always the path of least resistance (besides going back to sleep). If I make it harder to use my pc, I will be able to easily beat this habit. I will do this right after posting this.

Now I still have my smartphone. I already deleted apps like Twitch and Netflix and because the passwords I am using are just cryptic I won't be able to log in unless I reset my password which, you guessed it, is too much work for me. I still have YouTube installed because I have some great affirmation videos in my playlist which I think will help me. If I find myself watching useless content tomorrow I will also delete YouTube.

For the next days I will probably just stay in bed because I can't use my pc or smartphone to waste time. After that I will highly likely automatically start to read books. I hope when I don't play video games, watch videos or series and don't listen to music for a while I will have more energy and motivation for things like going to the gym because my brain can rewire itself to some degree.

After this I want to clean my room and go to bed at the same time every single day. I have some other things on my list but won't go into more detail because I already wrote too much.

It's a rollercoaster, sometimes I'm okay, then I'm not.

I'm really struggling atm and don't know what to do :(,"I have had suicidal thoughts for a while now but the past few weeks have been especially bad. This is for several reasons. I mainly have trouble with friends, health anxiety, and my past.

Recently the trust I have with my friends was brought into question and I fell into a deep depressive state which I didn't think I'd emerge from. I feel better about it now, but it's still effecting how I perceive certain things. My health anxiety has also been on a downward spiral due to the corona virus fear mongering and some issues I've been having with chapped lips (this is very recent, as in today, and although it seems like a small thing is really triggering for me. Any small health issue is at this point.). I also have ongoing issues with coming to terms with my past and the actions of my parents and family members as well as my own.

I've also recently developed some concerns about my mental state as now more than ever I've been experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. Maybe I'm being over the top when I say this but I fear it may be true as recently I've been arguing with myself vocally, and getting angry at my own thoughts to the point where I will verbally reply. It may sound normal on paper to some extent, but I believe it's different to simply talking to myself considering how I say things. 

I also fear I'm becoming delusional as I've been starting to think everyone around me is against me to an extreme degree. Sometimes I find myself looking at friends from a perspective that feels like I don't know them. I look at them and wonder why I am friends with them and if they even exist. I'm constantly questioning everything around me as if I was born yesterday to believe my life is what it is. I can't make sense of anything. The world, life, none of it. I don't understand anything and feel like it's all some elaborate lie or something. 

I also want to self harm all the time but recently haven't as I've scared myself due to how bad its been before. Once I scraped my head across a carpet so hard the skin on my forehead tore. I once cut my face with a broken hairbrush as well as the backs of both my hands. I've also cut and bitten and burnt, as well as slapping myself repeatedly for hours over and over forcing myself to cry.

Many nights I will force myself to cry as well. I used to do this with self harm but now due to being more sensitive I can achieve the effect simply through sad film scenes and songs.

Music used to be a relief for me but no longer is. I used to be able to listen to music to either help myself feel happier or wallow in my sorrow, both of which were at least some sort of release for me. But now none of it works and music just irritates me more than helping me get into a specific mood. I'm devoid of emotion at this point and feel like I'm just going along on a predetermined track.

Basically that's everything. I've also done things like sticking my hands in very hot water for extended periods but idk if that falls under self harm or just some weird thing I do.

Sorry its so long. Just wanted to put it all in writing. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. I'm planning on killing myself if things aren't on the up by the end of the week. Idk how yet but have some ideas. Just so anyone reading this is aware. Thanks again.",t2_3wr2pxcl,3,0,0,"I'm really struggling atm and don't know what to do :( I have had suicidal thoughts for a while now but the past few weeks have been especially bad. This is for several reasons. I mainly have trouble with friends, health anxiety, and my past.

Recently the trust I have with my friends was brought into question and I fell into a deep depressive state which I didn't think I'd emerge from. I feel better about it now, but it's still effecting how I perceive certain things. My health anxiety has also been on a downward spiral due to the corona virus fear mongering and some issues I've been having with chapped lips (this is very recent, as in today, and although it seems like a small thing is really triggering for me. Any small health issue is at this point.). I also have ongoing issues with coming to terms with my past and the actions of my parents and family members as well as my own.

I've also recently developed some concerns about my mental state as now more than ever I've been experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia. Maybe I'm being over the top when I say this but I fear it may be true as recently I've been arguing with myself vocally, and getting angry at my own thoughts to the point where I will verbally reply. It may sound normal on paper to some extent, but I believe it's different to simply talking to myself considering how I say things. 

I also fear I'm becoming delusional as I've been starting to think everyone around me is against me to an extreme degree. Sometimes I find myself looking at friends from a perspective that feels like I don't know them. I look at them and wonder why I am friends with them and if they even exist. I'm constantly questioning everything around me as if I was born yesterday to believe my life is what it is. I can't make sense of anything. The world, life, none of it. I don't understand anything and feel like it's all some elaborate lie or something. 

I also want to self harm all the time but recently haven't as I've scared myself due to how bad its been before. Once I scraped my head across a carpet so hard the skin on my forehead tore. I once cut my face with a broken hairbrush as well as the backs of both my hands. I've also cut and bitten and burnt, as well as slapping myself repeatedly for hours over and over forcing myself to cry.

Many nights I will force myself to cry as well. I used to do this with self harm but now due to being more sensitive I can achieve the effect simply through sad film scenes and songs.

Music used to be a relief for me but no longer is. I used to be able to listen to music to either help myself feel happier or wallow in my sorrow, both of which were at least some sort of release for me. But now none of it works and music just irritates me more than helping me get into a specific mood. I'm devoid of emotion at this point and feel like I'm just going along on a predetermined track.

Basically that's everything. I've also done things like sticking my hands in very hot water for extended periods but idk if that falls under self harm or just some weird thing I do.

Sorry its so long. Just wanted to put it all in writing. If anyone has any advice I'd appreciate it. I'm planning on killing myself if things aren't on the up by the end of the week. Idk how yet but have some ideas. Just so anyone reading this is aware. Thanks again."
Am thinking about suicide,Hi everyone am thinking about suicide. To start with some backstory am pretty young about 15 and my life has gone to shit. I play guitar and am pretty good and am funny. Last year my school had a Christmas Assembly and I played my saxophone in it (I played saxophone in the past) I had completely bombed and walked off the stage. My school would never let me perform again. They won’t even let me try out. Then I get treated like shit all the time. I get called stupid fat and ugly (even though it’s all bullshit). My grandparents don’t consider me a part of my family and I am constantly told that I can never be a musician. I am a pretty funny guy however am not politically correct because of that I get suspended a lot because some kids get offended about what I say. All I want is for some advice on what I can do.,t2_5vubfccw,2,0,0,Am thinking about suicide Hi everyone am thinking about suicide.

Why i do not ask for help,"I on a weekly occasion contemplate killing myself. I realize this probably isn't normal and I should get help, the only issue is it would ruin my career, probably making me want to kill myself even more. In my profession any kind of paperwork on mental disorders which suicide is considered to be one. Is an automatic separation and if you don't get separated. It will guarantee you cannot move forward in your career or do certain jobs maybe you've dreamed of.

Hello eveyone,"Hi. My name is Chris, this is the first time I'm posting here, but I've been around here for a little while.

I don't know whats wrong with me. My life is pretty good if I analyze it objectively, but I just can't bring myself to be happy or find any motivation to keep going forward. Nothing bad has happened to me recently, and there have been some small good things even, but still... I don't want to keep going. I know I'll eventually be happy again if I keep going, I have no doubt in my mind about it, but I also know I'll eventually be sad again. And I'm not so sure that those happy moments are worth all that suffering.

To me it seems like everyone is just happy by default. Maybe they get sad or depressed if something bad happens, but then everybody goes back to being ok. For some reason it's opposite with me, I get happy if something good happens, but then I always go back to being sad. Being sad it's just my default state, and I don't want it to be.

Does this make any sense? Is it stupid? Can anyone relate to that feeling?

To Go with a Smile,"Why am i different? I have really nice friends, i have a great family, i had a nice girlfriend and a good social life. Since half a year i play in a lovly team soccer, we loose always, but its a great team, i enjoy every second to train with them.
Im livin in a great home. I got everything in here i need like a good pc, a ps4, a nice kitchen and so on.
Im working /worked but now im injured. Great money, not rich or something, but great money in my opinion. 
I think about the poor souls in africa, siberia or i dont know, kids work and so on. I think, they have to work so hard and much for nothing or go to sleep without to eat and drink and feel sad for them.
I should be happy with my fcking life. I have passions and goals, im depressed, i guess, but i enjoy a lot of things.
Buuuut, im 27 years old now and since around 10 years i think about this. Its like music i dont want to listen to, but its in my head. 
Its really hard to explain. I dont want to live this classic life. I dont want to work my hole life, maybe find a girl and marry her, get a baby, work until im old, become ill in a lot of ways and someday, when all the people i loved died before me than i die and it is like i never touched this world.its like i can see my hole life.
 I thought, maybe when im older, things change. For example in school i thought. Get a girl and work a bit. It will change. It dont changed.
 Or i thought. Chase your dreams like do this, go there, change yourself. I did this and the feeling is still there.
And the worst thing is, if i could win a lot of money, i would stop to work and enjoy a lot of years with traveling and so on. But in the end, i would have the same feeling. Just delayed.
I know, its really hard to understand. My Therapist, i had for like 2 month said, he cant understand me, my friends dont and im not sure i understand my own feelings. The only thing that stopped me till today is, that i dont want to go to hell and, i dont want to leave my family and friends sad and maybe damaged for their lives, but theres no escape and i want to do it.
Right know i plan to get a credit for around 10 to 20 thousend and enjoy my last summer on earth with my best friend traveling to japan, thailand, hawai and maybe another place with amazing food, amazing places, girls and sports. This credit will be low enough, so no one have to pay it back, if im gone forever.
I will give some money to family and friends and the team.
Why i write this? I have no fcking clue. I will write a lot of letters, record a bit for youtube so everyone i think has to know it, will see, what i go trough.
Since i made my decision, i feel free. All the things i want to do, i will do soon.And than, im just gone ,with a smile on my face. The ultimate Goal.

Ive landed myself in therepy twice: first, calling the suicide hotline and accidentally ordering a fucking cps raid on my house (big mistake, i just wanted a friend to talk to) and second I tried to hang myself a year later and left a fairly obvious red burn + bruise around my neck. Both times I visited therepy sessions, i spent all of my time talking to the counselors lying. I refused to be labed depressed. I didn't want the stigma and sideways glances from my friends and family. For some reason, I saw this label of depression as a bad thing. I always did everything i could to avoid a diagnosis. After CPS got callef called after I opened up to the lady on the text line, i was afraid to be honest. I lied about my attempts, i lied about being sad, i lied about a lot. At the end I ironically tried to get a diagnosis to get on meds but I had lied so far the doctor refused to believe me and said I wasnt depressed, so thags cool. I've spent a LOT of time using the free crisis textline and i've never been able to pin if im actually depressed or if I'm making all this shit up. I really dont know.

Family, money, friends, a girlfriend, everything. I still can't help but want to kill myself. I've spent HOURS researching the subject and I know the statistics and efficiency of all of the methods of suicide. I even know exactly how i'd do it if i ever get in that situation again. So, does that make me suicidal? Depressed? Bipolar? Or am i just another idiot in the world who blows up his problems to get attention? Who knows?

I know it sounds and feels nice, but they leave. They always leave. It will fuck you up when you lose your only coping method, and it aint gonna be fun. Dont do that. I know you get all that ""just dont be sad"" bullshit but you got this. Personally i'm a pussy and cant commit to an attempt for real, but attempting is part of the realization that its not worth it. If you have the want to attempt, dont. Wait 2 weeks, and if you feel the same way about life, i wont stop you. Just remember. Theres no way out. Once you kick the stool, or jump off the bridge, theres no takebacks. You wont be able to see the sea turtles in the ocean, you wont be able to see the next cool superhero movie, it all goes away. Your family will spend all the money for your funeral, youll never meet your nieces and nephews, youll never meet the girl you were fated to fall for, and worst of all, youll destroy the people around you. Family, friends, even your school or workplace. Sure the storm will pass and you will eventually be ""forgotten"" as you guys like to morbidly put it, but all non-celebrities are forgotten when they die.

I know it sounds and feels nice, but they leave. They always leave. It will fuck you up when you lose your only coping method, and it aint gonna be fun. Dont do that. I know you get all that ""just dont be sad"" bullshit but you got this. Personally i'm a pussy and cant commit to an attempt for real, but attempting is part of the realization that its not worth it. If you have the want to attempt, dont. Wait 2 weeks, and if you feel the same way about life, i wont stop you. Just remember. Theres no way out. Once you kick the stool, or jump off the bridge, theres no takebacks. You wont be able to see the sea turtles in the ocean, you wont be able to see the next cool superhero movie, it all goes away. Your family will spend all the money for your funeral, youll never meet your nieces and nephews, youll never meet the girl you were fated to fall for, and worst of all, youll destroy the people around you. Family, friends, even your school or workplace. Sure the storm will pass and you will eventually be ""forgotten"" as you guys like to morbidly put it, but all non-celebrities are forgotten when they die. That girl who got hit by a drunk driver a year ago was forgotten, it doesn't really matter who you are, but it does matter why youre here. Ranted extra hard for you guys ;) take care."

I'm going to fail,"I'm going to fail university. I can't go anymore. The thought of attempting paralyzes me. I can't find work, so I won't get any financial support if I fail or take a break or leave. I'll be homeless and worthless.

i know nobody else cares. “oh you are only 16, it wasn’t a real relationship, it only gets worse”

i’m so alone. between my relationships, family issues and my friends - i have no one. nobody to reach out to, nobody to vent to. I can’t take this anymore - i really can’t. 

My only online friends are 2 years younger than me. I can’t even make friends my own age, and i hate that. i get bullied constantly for it. I’m pathetic.

"I don't even know anymore, my head is about to explode","I don't know where to begin. When someone asks why I'm feeling so bad, I just say ""Yes"".

I'm 22 years old and everything I have ever experienced or done, in regards to everything, has gone wrong. Not a single thing has gone well. Not the things I can change (like finding friends, getting a girlfriend, making money), not the things I cannot change (my overall health, how my family has shaped).

I feel and see that anything I do is absolutely pointless, there are no results anywhere to be found. And I can cope with myself, I am just fine, I don't even care that I am miserable, poor, have no friends, nobody will ever love me and I will die alone, as long as I don't get reminded.

What do I mean by that? Getting reminded? When I speak to people and they are overly happy, it makes me want to puke. When I see a happy couple together, my blood pressure shoots up and I get really angry. And I feel like everyone is going out of their way just to piss me off/show me what they have and I don't.

I feel, tss, feel, I KNOW, that nobody in the real world gives a flying donkey about me. Sometimes, when I start thinking about it for a while, I realize just how screwed my life is, and that I probably should have killed myself years ago, and that people who were like me are probably already dead. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

I'm not even crying, I just feel like my cheeks are full of tears and are just dragging my face down. And that this place in my chest, where the heart and soul are supposed to be, I feel like there's nothing left. And I feel this hatred and anger towards everyone and everything, that travels through my nerve system, and I can feel the heat in my head, and the cold goosebumps on my back.

I'm wondering - is this the end?," 

I'm not sure why I'm typing this. This will be a congealed mess of words, I'm hoping someone can relate - though I'm not sure what anyone can do to help me.

I am in a great situation compared to others, I'm not in a warzone, I'm not abused, I have no reason to feel this way. I was 13 when I first had these feelings. Self harm, eating disorder, depression, anxiety - my first suicidal thoughts. I became better, but I spiralled down again. I realise I was never better, but the good days outweighed the bad days.

I'm now the worst I've ever been. Though I've matured now. Self admitted to therapy, doctors referrals, everything I could do - I've tried. I am not self harming, skipping meals but I'm the worst I've ever been. I should be happy that I'm 18 now, I can drive, go get smashed at the club - yet nothing. The anxiety is through the roof, it feels like I'm drowning. My teenage happy years feel like they have been stolen from me, did I deserve this? Probably not. No-one deserves it.

I suffer from a couple chronic illnesses, they stop me leaving the house. I am missing a lot of college, I am going to be kicked out soon - I know it. I have been an open book to them. Every doctors note, therapy note they have scanned to their system. But I can't keep going. I don't see a future for me. I wonder what my future will be like, but I can only see now. Tonight isn't the night I'm leaving my past behind - but I know soon I'll bite the bullet.

I just wish there was more support for men. I haven't tried any medications for this illness, the doctors have rejected it. I think that was my last chance of hope.

My Suicide Note (Draft),"Dear friends and family,  


I've lost my long battle with my thoughts. I'm taking my own life.  


What I am going to do is inexcusable and I know I'm going to put a lot of people through a lot of pain. I can't pretend that I won't be missed, I am making my decision with that very much at the forefront of my mind. My suicide is selfish to be sure. But I can't keep living just because of what is essentially a feeling of guilt. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I am deeply sorry.  


I also want you to know that I don't blame anybody. Especially not my parents. I am going into the grave at peace in this regard. You shouldn't blame yourself either. Anybody who knows me well, knows that I've had suicidal tendencies for a long time. I'm sick of making what are basically just thinly veiled threats. It's time for me to take action, and take control.  


I blame myself for everything. Every day I am doing new things that I'm going to feel insecure about later. All of these things mounting on top of each other and fuelling my anxiety to become worse and worse. It never gets better, existing just feels like continuous torment and struggle. I can't play that game anymore. I'm sorry friends and family, I love you, but I'm making the selfish decision. I hope you find a way to heal the hole that I leave.

In a weird state between wanting to keep pushing vs going off the cliff’s edge,"Hey everyone,

I know I’m not alone here, hence why I’m taking the time to write this post.

Recently, a lot of events took place that drove me to a very dark place. A good friend of mine I grew up skateboarding with since high school took his own life a few months ago. I was also in the midst of a strong LSD trip around the same time and I had suicidal ideations during the trip. Also during that time, I broke my arm, battled the flu for a couple weeks straight, received threats from multiple people stemming from stupid drama, and my roommates got into a full fledged fist fight which made the living situation very tough and bills got steep because of my ex-roommates moving out due to the altercation.

All these events put me on a gnarly manic episode so I had to turn myself into the psych ward. That shit felt like prison. I wasn’t able to go outside at all during the entire stay. They were pumping me with lithium, trazodone, and 3 different drugs twice a day. The side effects were brutal. It made my sleep paralysis pop up a lot more than usual, and I heard very audible voices communicating directly with me when I was on those medications. I forced myself to put on a false smile at the facility so I can convince the staff to release me sooner rather than later due to “good behavior.”

Since getting out, I’ve been making a constant effort everyday to improve my overall health. I meditate everyday, and I’m getting back into a workout routine since my arm is almost fully healed. Going back to the medications though, I stopped taking them; I couldn’t handle the side effects anymore. I am seeking therapy though. And I do actively reach out to my mother and loved ones about this situation. However, during my therapy sessions, I left out one crucial detail. I still have suicidal thoughts creeping up. I’m scared that I’ll be locked up in the psych ward again. Mental illness has this funny thing of reminding you that you’ve never good enough no matter how much you push or strive to get better. Everytime I make progress, I relapse in a hard hitting depressive episode. It’s also been like this since day one. I have high functioning depression. On the outside, I have my shit together. I work a stable job and live on my own. I have healthy relationships with my mother and close friends. I practice lots of good habits like healthy eating, meditation, and exercise. But all that is just a cover up for how I really feel inside.

My high functioning depression stems from a lot of things. I dealt with a lot of trauma since birth. I never grew up with my dad, my mom went through two divorces, and she had to lie to me about who my real dad was until she told me the truth when I was 19 and was somewhat developed enough to grasp the concept. I also have Aspergers Syndrome, and struggled to make friends for a long time. I was also a victim of bullying, rape, and child abuse. On the flip side, I committed a lot of acts of true evil that have traumatized people for good, whilst tainting my soul and crushing my spirit. I’ve also have never been in a committed relationship; I’m almost 25 now...That left a bitter feeling of loneliness. I already grew up as an only child with zero childhood friends so it’s just added salt to the wound. This led me to a bad substance abuse phase that lasted for around 10 years and I’m just now turning the corner around that. However, despite whatever progress I make, like I stated before: mental illness has a funny way of reminding you that you ain’t shit when you least expect it, for no fucking reason at all. This shit also forced me to wear a mask to hide all these problems and the scary thing was that I was so good at hiding it, I convinced myself that I was ok, even though I really wasn’t deep down.

The only reason why I haven’t killed myself yet is because I would put my close friends through a lot of pain. And my mom would have it the worst. She would be beyond broken if I took my own life. But the pain is getting more and more unbearable by each waking second. Every morning I dread getting up, and I’m just using pure willpower at this point to keep pushing, for my loved ones. But holy shit, it is so draining. The two things that have kept me sane for a while (music, skateboarding) doesn’t hit like how it used to. It’s becoming more dull. Same with food. I only eat now cause I’m forcing myself to, knowing that I need those nutrients to survive. This feeling that has been lingering my whole lifetime is still present. No matter how much I fight it, it’s still there.

I know I’m not alone here, hence why I’m taking the time to write this post.

Recently, a lot of events took place that drove me to a very dark place. A good friend of mine I grew up skateboarding with since high school took his own life a few months ago. I was also in the midst of a strong LSD trip around the same time and I had suicidal ideations during the trip.

I can't control these feeling,"For as long as I can remember I have always put myself in pain. The earliest memory I have is sitting in my dad's truck under the hot Arizona sun and feeling the inside of the truck getting hotter and hoping my heavy breathing would pass me out. It never happened and I was only 6. From then on it was jay walking without looking, taking too much NyQuil, drinking excessive melatonin hoping I would just sleep forever. 

Now, I'm 22 and there's a Mossberg 12 gauge shotgun sitting in the closet whispering to me. There's a sharp butcher knife in the kitchen begging for me to use it on myself. And even a thick rope stored away in my backyard closet hoping for me to choose it. There's so many methods begging me to use but I'm scared. 

I know my emotions are a wack job and a lame excuse for my actions but I can't seem control them. I get in an adrenaline frenzy to escape and hope for a shootout or for a car to hit me straight on. Maybe even just turning on the car and inhaling those heavy breathes of CO2. 

I have nothing to live for. I make my boyfriend sad and angry half of the time. My parents love me unconditionally but I know I'm a disappointment. All my siblings are far apart and don't see as a sister. More as my father's bastard who they HAVE to interact with.

I want to end it all. There's no worth in my life if I can't even see a psychologist who I can't afford and I can't be a bigger burden to my boyfriend since he's my only outlet.

I want everyone to grieve me when I'm gone,"I've had dreams that I told people how dark my soul is from the manic depressive illness I have, and they always walk away out of shock or try to pretend like they don't hear because it's too much.

I don't care that things could get better.

I'm sick of the entire process of maintaining my bipolar mood swings and managing myself with meds. It's like climbing up a slippery staircase and every time I get close to the top, I slip down and have to restart. My doctor can only make my medication go up once more before I have to try new medications for my bipolar disorder and I really can't live with having to restart on new meds.

I'm sick of the ups, the downs, the neutrals, just everything. 

I don't care that I have a bright future.

I don't care how sad people will be when I'm gone. I want them to be sad. I want them to know the real me -- the dark me.

Even when I'm happy, the sun is shining, and I'm with my dog and singing out loud, I still ache for absolute nothingness.

Anyone like to watch death vids online?,"One thing I am scared of is losing my independence.

I was hoping it would be him because he's 70 but he's going to last forever.

I got back into death vids and neck belting. I saw a vid of someone smashing their head wide open on a rock and fantasized, how can I do that? Today, I belted my neck unconscious.

Hello I feel like a crazy person,"Hi I'm new-ish to reddit so ya sorry if this post sucks but um lately I feel like I'm going insane everyday my fears get worse and worse like for example I'll think that someone is going to break in/ is already in my house if I hear the slightest noise. Or if I hear a plane flying really low or thunder or something ill think I'm gonna get struck by lightning or a plane is going to crash into my house, sometimes It even feels like I'm going to be bombed. I've imagined every loved one in my life dying and it's so scary. The slightest confirmation of my irrational fears makes me want to die even more cuz I'm scared of it happening and seeing my family suffer. I don't leave my house anymore and I hurt myself to cope. I even sometimes feel like paranormal things are out to get me like I'm surrounded by ghosts. Every day keeps blending together and I feel really pathetic that I'm doing nothing to help my family but it's so hard to muster any energy. I'm trying hard to cling on to certain milestones like my birthday or fun events I want to go to but it's hard. I'm probably never going to find anyone who'll love me I look really gross lol but even if I was attractive I'm still a coward. I just wish I was beautiful I want to just chop off the things I hate about myself and become a better person that people might actually like and not think I'm weird. I don't want to die necessarily I just want the thoughts to go away, I want to stop thinking my dad's going to have a heart attack or my friends are gonna commit suicide. Idk what I'm saying anymore this is so messy lmfao Idk how to do this this is hurting my brain.

I deserve to suffer,"Depression and anxiety make me feel like I will never amount to anything in my life.

My therapist is a good person and all but I just don't feel like therapy is working. I keep my feelings bottled up insede me and eventually they will erupts like they have already in the last three attempts.

Every day I like to fantasies my death but in the most horrible painful way. I want to commit even more everyday. I don't feel this as a bad place because the best career I have a chance at is the meth labs.

With all theese thoughts it means I cry to myself alit, but tonight my tears ran dry. My eyes hurt, i feel like 8ve cried to the point where I will cry no more. Today I feel more empty, less passionate and more heartless than before. I feel more like an asteroid waiting till that day where I plummit to the ground. 

There is a skyscraper in my city and I am planning to either jump off that, hand myself or forcefully drown myself and feeling the pain. I want to end it so bad, and not like those pathetic attempts I've tried before. I deserve to suffer and that's how it will be

Suicide note,"Dear mum,

I’m sorry I have made this decision. I hope you can respect that me being alive is continual torment and that it is just a relief for me to be able to put an end to it all. I’ve tried my best to overcome the bad things that have happened to me but I always find myself back in this dark abyss that I can’t get out of, I can’t see any reason to live and I don’t want to live. I’ve spent years not being able to leave bed now and it has outlived promises people said it would get better, it hasn’t got better and has now gotten worse again.

Life's not fair,"I've largely learned to be an adult on my own. I wasn't really raised, in fact I raised my younger siblings. I have no relationship with my biological father. I still talk to my mother, but sparingly. My step father was an awful person that beat me, insulted me, made me feel worthless, and molested me.

The only thing I ever truly learned from the adults in my life, is that life just isn't fair. We play the hand were dealt, this isn't ground breaking stuff, but it's all they gave me.

I moved out when I was 16. My stepdad had gone to jail and my mom was forced to move to section 8 housing that could fit her, and the 5 children she forced into this world. I refused to change schools again and move from the friends that I had.

I never had anything handed to me. I've worked very hard to get where I am. I beat the pattern. I got out of a bad house. I finished high school, I've never not worked. I made all the moves I could to move on from the past. Yet, as I lay here in bed, I can't stop thinking about ending my life. 

I've had thoughts of killing myself for as long as I can remember. It's not an everyday thing anymore, but it's still there. It still persists. 

I've fought this urge for a long time. I'll continue to fight. I won't take my life tonight, it doesn't seem fair to those I love, but alas, life isn't fair.

Feeling so ignored,"I feel so fucking ignored, all the time. I come to fucking suicidewatch and guess what? Even here im ignored. I cant expect anything from anyone, i know this, i cant expect shit from strangers online.

But oh my god. Im crying right now. All i want to is to die. 

Tou know when you have that one person you want to talk to or hear from? That one single person that makes everything feel better, that means the world to you? And then you cant even fucking reach out because things are just not like that anymore. And no matter what i cant not care. I feel helpless. 
Because here i cant hear from him, and no one else fucking even sees me or hears me. I feel like an idiot cause i dont even wanna care about this person, but theyre always!! On my mind and im going crazy, bacause ill bet my life on them not even thinking about mez and at this point i want to see them suffer like they made me. Its vicious i know, but its all because of how careless this person is.

And im all alone, so fucking alone and the only thing i want is to die, because i just cant take life anymore. I have no one, my family gives jack shit about me and im always alone and i cant reach any of my goals in life. Why even bother anymore? For what? For a small little hope of maybe acheiving happiness? No i cant strive for maybes thats more likely nothing in the end. 

I just wanna give up. All im waiting for is to find what way to go out. Thats my biggest struggle right now, nobody gives a shit about me so im not worried about whos gonna hurt when im gone - they shouldve seen me when i was alive and struggeling to even be a person.

Welp here I go,"I’m laying in bed, it’s 8:02pm, my family is watching Goblet of Fire, and I’m about ready to go. I won’t bore you with my life story but just to run down the reasons.

I got straight Ds in all my classes 

My teachers have informed me I will have to take summer school

I’m a dyke 

I’ve been a complete shit to everyone in my life

The people at school will be sad for about a month and then move on with their lives

My father has molested me and gotten away with it

And I’m a completely unlikable person who can’t get anything done despite being given countless extra aid

Once my family is asleep in around 2-3 hours I’ll sneak into the kitchen grab the antihistamines, grab my sprite, lock myself in the bathroom and take everything in it. My family will find me in the morning, I know they’ll be heartbroken but here I am doing it anyway, so y’all can’t say I’m a good person at heart, because I’m doing this to my family and myself.

Talked down by the person that trigger me to suicide,"There was a lot going on. My ex and I wasn't in a toxic relationship, well at least I didn't think it was. Few days ago, he wanted alone time and we had our fair share of time to think through things. 
Yesterday, I met him. I could see that he wanted to try again but at the end of the day, we are just not compatible. Apparently, i'm full of shit. 

I packed my things and was chased out of the house. He knew I was suicidal and yes, I have been planning to end my life in years. He was worried, and for the first time, he cried for me and begged me not to kill myself. I was shocked. Didn't know how to respond. 

Honestly, he isn't the reason why I wanted to end it. He was just the trigger, the last straw. I am just living borrowed time from my previous attempt. Idk why in that moment when I heard his cries, I felt angry at how everyone wants a depressed person to stay alive just so they don't have to go through the guilt and hurt. 

He talked me down, and honestly it's a blur. I don't really remember how i changed my mind... At the end of the day, he just didn't want to watch me die and he loves me. But we gtta fix ourselves first. I respected his decision. 

Tbh, I am still sour at how 2 people in the entire world found each other and yet, we can't be together due to the incompetence. I wish I was a better catch for him to keep.

Now I'm awake, going to work. It is so tough to pull through everything I have went through and the thought of smiling at everyone to put up a front, disgusts me. I honestly don't know if I can stay alive any longer. Losing him just made me even certain that there's something very wrong with me.

life is over at 18,"long story my life is over before it started. i used to be excited to wake up everyday now i cant stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

first of all im illiterate i barely finished 10th grade i was taken out by my parents for dumb reasons (another reason im suicidal) ive  had dyslexia since the 1st grade so idk why it was a great idea to take me out of school. i already have learning issues so lets make it harder for me please. im an 18 year old girl who cant get along with her family has no friends to run to when i cant stay home, im losing faith in God/humanity. i am christian but why does god hate me so much to make my life so miserable ?!?!? why do i try hard and still have this life !?!? no i dont have my GED or diploma i cant take it because 1 i have practiced online and i dont know 80% of the stuff bc again i didnt go to school and bc of my learning disability it makes it 5x as hard to study (even tho i still try, im not giving up). 2 my parents wont give me money to take it. 3 my mom said she wouldnt give me the money to take it because she has no faith in me. 4. ive been waiting 2 years to to get into a home schooling or a ged program they will not enroll me. why dont i get a job and pay for it ??. my parents wont give me my documents. why dont i report them because im an adult and they legally cant hold my documents (birth certificate, ID, SSN) because i dont wanna be homeless and im an adult so they could legally kick me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

 i wanna die bc whats the point of living !??!?! most kids at 18 have finished high school have a job arent fucking stupid like me are actually in college have friends social lives and are ready to move out while im still be treating like a kid getting my phone taken away have no money cant get a job cant get a license cant get an education because my parents wont let me. imagine wanting an education and your parent havenent put you in school in 4 years !?!?! and you couldnt do a thing about it bc you were underaged and if you told anyone like CPS they would kick you out. and how would i get a job any way if if fucking too illiterate to write a paragraph and you have social anxiety so bad you cant speak.

&amp;#x200B;

my mom hates me she told me that. she said im not her daughter im just a bitch she gave birth to. shes verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. a fucking drunk, she starts arguments and fights and when i pushed her off of me once my whole family acted like i was the problem. yelling at me claiming i hit her. i wish i fucking could punch her in the face !!! my dad doesn't live with me. he lives in a man camp for his job so i cant live with him.  

&amp;#x200B;

i used to have one friend who was in the same situation as me we were planning on leaving our toxic parents and moving out together. but she moved out bc she had a boyfriend so now she lives with him  and his nice family. i dont talk to her anymore because thats how life goes but lucky her to have a loving support system i have no boyfriend im asexual because i was raped as a child and now cant form intimate relationships and they make me uncomfortable. wow i love childhood trauma making me suicidal today. i told my parents when it happened when i was young seems like they dont care now bc they still bring him up to this day because he lives down the street from our home ( he was a family) i hate them for that.

i have no one because i cut everyone off by isolating myself. most of my friends were in school so when i left i became depressed and stopped talking to people. the moved on with life to have great lives. getting into college, moving out, finding better less boring people to hang with. i see them on social media living it up while im on the verge of suicide everyday. even the people that bullied me in school are living great. parties every weekend happy lives. i wasn't shy when i was in school. i was the type of person to become the shy kids friend. if i saw someone sitting alone i would go sit with them. i was nice to everyone. I was bubbly always making jokes hyper ect. i had big group of friends. so seeing myself depressed and lonely and dull with no emotion makes me feel even more pathetic. i met with an old friend i couple weeks ago and he said i was so different now and ""BORING"" .i thought to me self yeah thats what depression does to you. i havent spoke to him sense bc he hasnt hit me back. guess i really was boring fuck. i try talking to my old friends. we didnt leave off on beef but they just dont reply or they treat me like im someone under them. they probably know i didnt graduate. or they have better lives than me and are busy so thats why im beneath them. i see people from school still friends and close hanging out and loyal but i go through a tuff time in my life and NO ONE COULD STAY BY MY SIDE. im not exaggerating i have literally no one but myself NO FRIENDS NO FAMILY AT 18 YEARS OLD NO ONE BY MYY SIDE SAYING ""YOU CAN DO THIS"" JUST ME AND IM SICK OF ME.

IM FUCKING DONE WITH LIFE I WANT THIS TO BE OVER. i have only put out good and love into the world when my friends were depressed i cried for them and talked them out of sadness and hurt. i was there for people. i never was a bully. i never hurt people. NOW IM SUFFERING I NEED SUPPORT MORE THEN I EVER HAVE IN MY LIFE AND I GET LEFT ON DELIVERED LEFT ON READ, ""SORRY IM TOO BUSY, SORRY I HAVE PLANS""............................................LIFE ISNT HOW IT WORKS ON THE MOVIES. BAD PEOPLE DONT GET WHAT THEY DESERVE AND THE GOOD GUYS DONT GET THE LAST LAUGH . IF YOURE GOOD IN THIS WORLD AND YOU LOVE EVERYONE YOU SUFFER  THE MOST AND GET A SHITTY LIFE. MAYBE IF I TREATED PEOPLE LIKE SHIT MY WHOLE LIFE ID BE HAPPY. IM DONE AT THIS POINT I DONT CARE .",t2_5vs16poz,2,0,0,"life is over at 18 long story my life is over before it started. i used to be excited to wake up everyday now i cant stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

first of all im illiterate i barely finished 10th grade i was taken out by my parents for dumb reasons (another reason im suicidal) ive  had dyslexia since the 1st grade so idk why it was a great idea to take me out of school. i already have learning issues so lets make it harder for me please. im an 18 year old girl who cant get along with her family has no friends to run to when i cant stay home, im losing faith in God/humanity. i am christian but why does god hate me so much to make my life so miserable ?!?!? why do i try hard and still have this life !?!? no i dont have my GED or diploma i cant take it because 1 i have practiced online and i dont know 80% of the stuff bc again i didnt go to school and bc of my learning disability it makes it 5x as hard to study (even tho i still try, im not giving up). 2 my parents wont give me money to take it. 3 my mom said she wouldnt give me the money to take it because she has no faith in me. 4. ive been waiting 2 years to to get into a home schooling or a ged program they will not enroll me. why dont i get a job and pay for it ??. my parents wont give me my documents. why dont i report them because im an adult and they legally cant hold my documents (birth certificate, ID, SSN) because i dont wanna be homeless and im an adult so they could legally kick me out. 

&amp;#x200B;

 i wanna die bc whats the point of living !??!?! most kids at 18 have finished high school have a job arent fucking stupid like me are actually in college have friends social lives and are ready to move out while im still be treating like a kid getting my phone taken away have no money cant get a job cant get a license cant get an education because my parents wont let me. imagine wanting an education and your parent havenent put you in school in 4 years !?!?! and you couldnt do a thing about it bc you were underaged and if you told anyone like CPS they would kick you out. and how would i get a job any way if if fucking too illiterate to write a paragraph and you have social anxiety so bad you cant speak.

&amp;#x200B;

my mom hates me she told me that. she said im not her daughter im just a bitch she gave birth to. shes verbally, mentally, and physically abusive. a fucking drunk, she starts arguments and fights and when i pushed her off of me once my whole family acted like i was the problem. yelling at me claiming i hit her. i wish i fucking could punch her in the face !!! my dad doesn't live with me. he lives in a man camp for his job so i cant live with him.  

&amp;#x200B;

i used to have one friend who was in the same situation as me we were planning on leaving our toxic parents and moving out together. but she moved out bc she had a boyfriend so now she lives with him  and his nice family. i dont talk to her anymore because thats how life goes but lucky her to have a loving support system i have no boyfriend im asexual because i was raped as a child and now cant form intimate relationships and they make me uncomfortable. wow i love childhood trauma making me suicidal today. i told my parents when it happened when i was young seems like they dont care now bc they still bring him up to this day because he lives down the street from our home ( he was a family) i hate them for that.

Give me a reason to live,"Hello, i’m a 15 year old boy. I have a normal normal house, normal friends, and a family. Ever since I was 12 I have known that I do not matter.

They put their own expectations and goals onto my life and pressured me into doing them that I do not feel as if i control my own life. My own mother told me that if i was white, i would be so much better, after she told me that i never wanted to live again. i can barely smile anymore out in public because i cannot forget those words my parents said to me. Worse of all is that they act as if they never said those words and that i am crazy. I have no one to open my feelings to due to not a single person I know ever wanting to care. I want to die, and I know that nobody will care. I have tried to relay my feelings to my “best” friend, but all he cares about is his own life problems which i listen to 24/7.

My parents put me into a school where i do not fit in and choose not to listen to me when i ask to go somewhere else that’s more accepting of me. All i want is to make a friend that can listen to me.

I want a hug from someone who cares. I want to be feel like i belong in this world. Please, someone give me a reason to live.

Just need to say it...,"Was originally a comment on another post, but I really like how it’s written.

 I attempted at 12 (was hospitalized twice in 2 weeks) got sent to a mental hospital for,ironically, 2 weeks. That’s how my parents learned that I hated myself so much I went against the hardwiring of my own brain to purposely harm myself. I can’t give you advice, but I will say this. Being in the ER at ~ 10:00pm and your parents standing over you as you lay there. The tension is so high and the sadness is palpable. It’s more awful than telling them in the comfort of your own home than police entering your house in the middle of the night and waking up your parents just to inform them that their daughter had just made an attempt on her life, and that they she was being taken to the hospital. To make matters worse... I was pretty aware of what was happening and knowing that your parents are following you as you sit there in the ambulance. Would never recommend.

I want to die with my childhood bullies,"I am 19 years old male south korean. I was bullied since first year of elementary school til the last year of high school. Even though in high school i was barely bullied except few cases, i hate bullies in this period the most than other school age. 

The worst memory is middle school age, where people around me had assaulted me physically, verbally, financially and even sexually. For example they hit and kicked face and body, sometimes in pit of the stomach. They made fun of my mom sexually and i cant do anything. They took my money and food. They stole my book. They throw my shoes and bag,cases out of the window and i couldnt find some of them. They even stole school lunch. In sexually, they kicked my balls, squash and scratch my penis, taking my pants off(even underwear too) in front of girls and made fun of me sexually and spread lies about my body and more. They made my mental illness way worse and they now be like nothing happend.

Why i did not fight back is i was too afraid and they are too many.
Some of bullies learned martial arts like boxing and taekwondo or even muay thai so they beat other people more cruelly. I know martial arts should be for weaker people. But in korea, bullies uses their martial arts to beat more people worse. 

Now i am college student but couldnt forgive what they had done to me. So i want to revenge. Sometimes i think what if i chose one(the worst and strongest) of my bullies and kill him and all of his family cause i cant find all of them, then i kill myself too. It is just thought i am having these days and it gives me both thrill and anxiety at the same time.

I need to stay for my kids but it's too much,"I just spent the last few hours googling ways to kill myself and in the end I think I can just buy a few big bottles from the liquor store and down them as fast as I can.

I’ve accepted that it’s too late for me.,"There is no hope for me to recover from my mental illnesses. 

When I was a kid, I thought everything would be okay if I got away from my parents. “Just get away from them, then before you know it, you’ll be yourself again.” used to help me hoard off suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 

But I’m 25 now. Haven’t lived with my parents in years. Hell, don’t even talk to them. Yet it’s the same. I’m still a depressed blob. Still holding onto trauma. 

Fuck near death experiences. They shouldn’t have saved me. They should have left me in the pool. Because now I know what death feels like. I felt death’s kiss for two and a half seconds. I think about those seconds almost every day of my life since then. 20 years later. 

No professional help I’ve received helped and I am done looking for strength inside myself. I’m fed up and I am done. 

I bring joy to people’s lives, but in the same breath bring sadness and burden. They would disagree with me, but I know it in my soul that they’re fed up with seeing and hearing me be depressed.

"I know on my gut I’m about to go do it, it’s just a matter of when.","*Edit: Title. I typed this post in one go. Less than five minutes. 

I have been in my room since 2019. I haven’t gone out.

For a time last year, I did try to fight. I was very active at my home gym and had a personal trainer come over. But I just can’t pretend anymore. Years before that, I still achieved in my career and worked in spite of what I was going through. 

That was 2017. 

It is now 2020. I have spent day in and day out just thinking about this, rationalising every possible scenario. I have lurked and scrolled Reddit for months on end. I literally spend 24 hours in bed. I shower only once or twice a week. 

I will not go through the trouble of sitting down and talking to someone. No matter who it is, (Therapist, friend or online stranger). It’s like reliving the experience all over again, that hurts. I just will not accept reality anymore. 

I have researched all methods. The quickest and most fool proof way is to jump from my building. I plan fo do it early in the morning so it doesn’t leave much of a mess. It’s a high rise building. 60th floor. 

Thanks for listening. Believe me, I have heard every trick and advice anyone can give because I did make the effort to read hundreds of thousands of comments searching for an answer.

It doesn’t suit my situation. 

Thanks for reading, and I’m happy for you, that any of you has a better life compared to mine. 

Do make it count because there are people like me who have done no wrong and fight like hell but are always dealt with bad cards, would do anything just to have what you have even for a day. 

A type of person who simply does no wrong to other human beings because they know what it feels. 

And the world and its people just keeps being selfish and pushing you. 

I tried praying and I said to whoever that god is, if you’re real take me already because you already know I can’t take it anymore. And you know why.

I do want help but part of my brain is convinced that im faking it and doing it for attention. These kind of thoughts happen whenever i want to fully explain myself to my doctor. Then i tend to end up in a spiral of negative thoughts which ends up with me isolating myself, hurting myself or making preparations for suicide attempts.

I don't know what to do. I feel like i can't get help and i will one day end up killing myself because my brain won't let me be honest. It sounds so stupid but its true.

Guilt of not being there last year of my dogs life,"I've always been with him 24/7. 15 years. Was living at my grandparents place. My family doesn't know how much I spend on my clothes, my grandmother awhile ago had given away a really expensive jacket of mine for free to someone I didn't like in our family. I was extremely pissed. Ended up taking her iPhone 5s to sell to get the money back and pretending I didn't k ow what happened to it. Eventually on the computer she came across my email and the craigslist ad selling it. Needless to say I got kicked out. Only friend I could move in with didn't allow dogs. So I left my dog there thinking I would figure out something to get him up here. I was about an hour away from him. My friend I let borrow my car fraudulently signed the title and stole it. Reporting it to the police did nothing. I couldn't afford to uber or lift. $86 there and back and rent was $600. Was barely making it going says without food sometimes. Ended up not being able to pay rent and moving into someones house.  Right off the bat I asked to bring my dog and they said eventually. So I let it go for awhile, then they asked me to take care of their grandfathers dog for a few weeks. Telling me if I did this for them I could being my dog.... so I did. And felt guilty af taking care if someone elses dog when I hadn't seen mine in so long. Then their two dogs had puppies, so I was afraid to even ask since they were bitching about how many dogs were in the house, and then those puppies since they were shitting and pissing in the kitchen 24/7, the dogs all got leptospirosis. So I didn't bring my dog there at all. Family telling me i should come see my dog soon so I was trying to save the money but $160 was so much and rent was so high I was just trying to save money. I begged my grandparents to let me stay the night with him but they said I couldn't be there that long so I was trying to save the money to bring him and keep him here. By the time I had enough money.... he passed away three days before.

I only saw him one time that year for 5 minutes. My friend had to stop at the police department down there and I went, he waited in the car while i said hi to my dog. He came up, wobbled up to me could barely walk anymore greeted me while.i was trying to pet him but he was more interested in sniffing my hands. Not really excited and yelping for joy like I hoped. Once he got done sniffing my hands he walked away. I figured he was just old and tired and back then I thought it wouldn't be much longer till I came back so I left with my friend again. That was the first time i saw him in like 7 months. 

Through almost a whole year I saw him for only 10 minutes. 

Now that he's dead and I missed my chance I keep thinking of what if he smelled the other dog on me and got sad thinking I found a new one. Or just didn't remember me.

Am i an asshole for wanting to have gotten more support after telling my friend i'm self harming.,"r/AITA doesn't allow any mention of self harm so I'll post it here.

Recently told (via text) my best friend that I trust the most that I've been dealing with self harm. And I expected more support.. or atleast not such cold answers.

A while ago (year?) I realised that I've been having negative thoughts and coping by self harming for years in the form of scratching untill i bled or biting, cutting and pulling my nails and the skin even when it already bled. I thought to myself that because I've been self harming myself for years already, why have I never thought about cutting. I cut myself for the first time and I felt ashamed and dissapointed that I let myself think about this and to let it get this far. After that it was always still on my mind, and I hated it.

My friend had depression and dealt with bad times too, but has never done any kind of self harm, I've always tried to be there for them when they wanted to talk or vent, because I felt the same way even though I never told them. I felt safe and I trusted them about this because I thought they could somewhat understand my feelings or something. This was the first time I ever told anyone about my self harm thoughts. After some awkward texts that i deleted (which they still read through the notifications), I decided to say fuck it and just tell them that I've been thinking about self harm.

After telling me to not be afraid to talk to them and that it's okay to talk about this kind of stuff, they went offline during the conversation, to sleep I guess, without saying bye or anything, while I wanted to finally get the stuff, that I've been holding in for years, off of my chest. I felt abandoned or let down when I felt like I needed them. I cut my self for the second time that night.

Four hours later and it was 5 a.m. and I sent them more stupid messages, basically revealing that I cut myself that night and how it felt. The responses I had when I woke up sounded like I was the problem, that this was my problem and I should deal with it myself, get help, that I'm not the only one who has such thoughts or cuts themselves.

I expected this to be different. I know they aren't obliged to help or listen to me at all, but I just wanted to be heard and this was the first time I ever tried opening up to anyone.

Desperation = Options,"When pondering my end, it seems a lot of doors open. Essentially there are no consequences (for me) for my final actions — one of the reasons I think the number of mass shootings has gone up in recent years. 

Of course, that’s not where my head is at. How many things would I never do for fear of dying? Maybe I should do those things. Skydiving. Freestyle mountain climbing. Might as well get a face tattoo while I’m at it. This nothing to lose attitude is actually kind of therapeutic. Eventually I’ll run out of money and just end it, but at least I can try to have some fun before I go.",t2_4q468,2,0,0,"Desperation = Options When pondering my end, it seems a lot of doors open.

Fucking hell,"So, I posted on here last month with a date and method and everything was planned out.

"I feel the end approaching, sooner than I thought.","I have a date in my head. It popped in there a while ago. For a bit it was comforting.

I've known the method for longer. One truly can't know for certain, but it should be peaceful and painless, for me. It wont be for those I leave behind. It will be cruel. It will be sad. I hate that I'm going to put them through hell. I'm tired of all of this.

I scared of the pain I see on the horizon. Climate crisis, pandemics, all of our cruelty and carelessness coming back to bite us. I'm adding to it now.

Just need to vent a bit,"My life isnt that bad, truly, but I'm still unbelievably depressed. I have a loving family, friends, I'm in college, but it still feels like I'm a failure, I find no motivation to do anything. I only am ever proactive when I really force myself and even then they're baby steps. I naturally don't want to talk to anyone, for some reason, and I hate myself for this, the deep down the only thing I want to do is sit around do nothing and smoke weed. And I dont know why, I enjoy going out and doing things but I will never take the first step. It feels like I'm just floating. Like when I leave school I'm just going to get hit hard with real life and fall flat on my face. I find social interactions tolerable but I never really enjoy them. I'm 19 and have yet to have my first girlfriend because for some reason I'm afraid of someone learning that I'm really not worth loving. It just feels like I'm not good enough. I was heavily depressed in middle school and early high school before coming out of it my junior and senior year. My parents think I'm thriving, and I just dont have the heart to tell them the truth. Everyday I find that I'm telling them more and more lies. I see the possibilities in front of me. I know if I really tried I could have a relationship like those around me. I see the clubs and sports and people that try to talk to me and know that I could be this well rounded likable person but It just feels like I dont care enough to get there. I'd really prefer to sit in my dorm all day playing video games, smoking weed, doing homework and sometimes hanging out with people. My interests, although existent feel unimportant. I just dont see a happy future for myself, and thats the scariest thing of all. I want so badly to be someone who can just allow themselves to be happy. But for some reason I can't and so I'll keep circling the drain until I either continue existing in what feels like the shell of a real life, or I fail spectacularly and I just end it. Neither seem optimal for someone who was given as big a head start as I was in life.

I don't want my family to know I died and get my body and plan a funeral or something I hate them. So I wanna go someplace where they can't get to me.
Its partly my fault,"I used to do things and have talents. at least people said so. I used to apparently be a piano wizz. I thought I sucked so i stopped. I dont know if im wrong but i wasnt happy with how i did. Same with drawing. I used to actually be good at drawing but I gave up. and Latin too. I thought I sucked at it. I used to get good marks in school but i've stopped studying or working. I do really badly now the teachers say im smart but I do not believe them. Im really ugly as well noone outside of my mom and her friends have ever complimented my appearance. and people at my school call me ugly a lot. A lot of the time i Cant respond to text messages and then people stop texting me. Things have stopped being enjoyable lately. All i do is play videogames because im bad at everything. I try to break the routine by going on walks but they just seem dull and boring. I sometimes take the bus into town but I just find it all depressing and I see people on drugs and just feel sad.

I dont know what will fix this. a girlfriend wouldnt change anything. I thought it would but It only made me happy for a few days

I think im going to an hero at some point in the near future. I think some people might miss be but I do not care because they will move on.

Can today finally be the day,"It’s beautiful outside. I started off my morning very bad. Yelled at for not wanting to have sex. Got screamed at, things throw at me. And he threatens to kill himself because of me. I’m really the worst. How terrible can someone be that you make another person want to kill themself? I have a lot to do today. Midterms are next week and I have to study. I know I wont be able to focus on anything no matter how hard I try. I have an idea. Not a plan but an idea. I keep pushing it off because of this or that. I’m tired of that now. Im going to put on my favorite clothes and do it. Or at least try. I probably wont actually do it because every time I’ve tried, I couldn’t do it. It is what it is. Its so hard because the only person who knows doesn’t want to hear it anymore and frankly, a lot of it is because of him. My family doesn’t know. They never knew. Even when i had cuts all over my arms as a teenager. This has been a horrible year. Its a beautiful day and I think it should be today. The date sounds right.

I lost the love of my life. Now life is pretty much over!,"This is my first post, I’ve read through on here for the past week without creating an account. I thought I was about time, because I’ve seen a lot of similar stories.

I’ve been separated from my wife for the past two month, we have been together for 14 years. (Married for 3). We have 2 amazing children together.

I admit I haven’t been the best husband or dad. I’ve taken them all for granted. I should have realised that I was being an arsehole a lot sooner. I spent too much time working rather than spending time with my beautiful family. Used to come in late from work and just fall asleep and not have time for anyone. My wife and I used to argue about loads of different things, like money and bills. I was a shit person, I made her feel shit unintentionally. I love her with the whole of my heart.

When we separated I had so much time to think about all the shit stuff that I had done. So I made loads of changes, spent less time in the office, started collecting kids from school, taking the kids out for dinner. I’ve lots loads of weight, because I’m working out, I’m paying for PT sessions. I genuinely believe I have changed my whole lifestyle to be a better person. 

Unfortunately this wasn’t enough for her. She doesn’t want me back. She said it’s a little too late. This is killing me so much. All I want is to hug her again. She is the love of my life. I miss her so much! I just want to be able to treat her like she should be treated. I’ve realised now what i should have been doing. She’s not having any of it. 

Now I have major regret. I’m in a dark place. I feel worthless. I’ve been to the doctor, they said that I have severe depression. It’s a big dark hole that I feel like I cannot get out of. I can’t function properly day to day. She told me to tell the kids it’s all my fault, she said the kids are not bothered wether I’m not there, they don’t ask for me etc. 

The kids are the only positive thing I have let in my life.

I don’t know what to do anymore. Will it ever get better? I feel like I don’t need to be around anymore. 

I feel like there’s nothing left for me now. Constant memories are making me feel shit all day everyday. I think that now she might be seeing someone else. So that means there would be no way for me to go back to the only love of my life.

"Suicidal Thoughts, But not suicidal.","Im 17 and for the past few weeks I've been having dreams and thoughts of suicide and I don't know what to do. The dreams are very vivid, and so are the thoughts.  I don't want to die, to commit suicide, to do any of that stuff, but it never goes away. 
I cut myself twice along my arms and I didn't want to- I just felt as if I wasnt there and watched myself do it. I wasn't focusing on it, I wasn't thinking about it. It was an idea in my head that I pushed away but I did it anyway.
I'm scared that the way I acted when I cut myself could happen for suicide, I have 3 earphones tied up in my room and I've made sure they can hold my weight. I don't even know why I made sure, or why the thought that I could hang myself with them has already gone so far.
Every night I look at my desk at where the earphones are and I shake, too scared to go near them. I don't want to touch them incase I do something. I'm constantly worried about it. I've seen in my dreams me stabbing myself, hanging myself, shooting myself, jumping off a cliff, ect. They started when I cut myself, but when I stopped they didn't. Then they started to become common thoughts that would be stuck in my head for hours, that would make me too scared to do anything just because I knew how easy it would be.

I can’t live like this,"I feel so useless. I can’t do anything right. I’m shy, antisocial and a loner. I’ve been depressed for several years now and it’s just getting worse and worse. 

I want to kill myself so badly, but I can’t bring myself to do it; not because I care about my life, but because it will devastate my parents. All other people that know/knew me will eventually recover from my suicide and continue with their lives as normal, but not my parents. 

I’m an only child. They dedicated their lives to me, they are paying for me to study what and where I wanted. They will never recover from my sucide and their lives will be over.

But I can’t live like this anymore. Every single day I wake up and regret waking up, regret that I didn’t magically die in my sleep. I try not to show how I feel, and I think I’m doing a good job - no one suspects that I’m suicidal.

Opening up about my life to the whole world,"i’m not feeling good at all. i want to die. but for some reason i felt like opening up. i’m sorry for taking your time. don’t feel the need to read, i’m just wasting your precious time 🙏🏻

people have too high expectations of me. i’m not allowed to make any mistakes or i’m seen as a worthless, a good for nothing child. i try my best, i really do. but it’s not easy. i just wish i could just be myself without any pressure. 

i am abused physically and mentally. i don’t really care if i get hurt by hitting or anything anymore, i feel like i deserve it. i don’t really mind the verbal abuse either, but it tends to make me think why i have to be so useless. imagine this. 4 is the worst grade you can get and 10 is the best. you get 9 1/2 from it and barely missed the 10 because of a little mistake you made. ”you are so fucking worthless.” ”you have to study.” ”why do you have to be like your big brother?” it’s not the greatest feeling you get from it. i don’t really mind myself being dissed, but the fact that people even dare to mention my perfect, best and most caring brother like that, i get so angry. i can’t even say anything back or they’ll hurt me. 

i’m scared of people. i start panicking when i’m around people and my chest just starts to hurt. i feel like i can’t breathe well. i think my fear of people might have started when i was picked up by a random man as a younger kid. 

i’m scared of doctors. i know that they’re supposed to help you and all, but i can’t help it. maybe it’s because my grandpa almost died in their hands only because of their little mistake, i don’t know. but my grandpa has been the closest person to me for as long as i can remember. 

i lost my close friend to cancer a few years back. at that time, i tried to kill myself for the first time. i felt so done with everything. guess who didn’t accomplish her goal? i still hate myself to this day for not doing it.

i had to put one of my animals down a few months later. i was NOT feeling any better and my thoughts were still there with me. the loss of my animal made me feel even worse because i kept blaming myself for something i could have never helped with. there went my 2nd attempt. still here.

the last two years after that have just been me constantly fighting back for no reason at all. i don’t know what keeps holding me back even though i don’t really have anything left. countless attempts and i’m still here.

i just want to go, really. why must i be somewhere where i don’t want to be? i can’t freely be myself or without pain. i just wish i could die peacefully and not live with the pain that just keeps increasing. it’s getting harder and harder. at the same time, the urge and the need to go is growing rapidly. just let me go, please.",t2_5skvqxy8,2,0,0,"Opening up about my life to the whole world i’m not feeling good at all. i want to die. but for some reason i felt like opening up. i’m sorry for taking your time. don’t feel the need to read, i’m just wasting your precious time 🙏🏻

public/altruistic suicide fantasy,"might delete this later depending on reception

i know this is probably a really shitty mindset to have but i really don't give a fuck, this is how i feel and i'm fucking tired of censoring myself for other people

i don't think that society as a whole really realizes what suicide is like and how serious it really is. i wish i could just use my pain to help benefit the other mentally ill kids like me and show everyone what it's really like.

i don't want to physically hurt other people, because that's just sending a message that mentally ill people are evil. if i was fucking stupid, i'd go and hurt others. but that wouldn't further my cause.

sometimes when i feel like complete and utter garbage i fantasize about going on TV or in front of a government building or somewhere very public where potentially influential people could see me, and briefly explaining my situation and how it relates to all the other depressed kids out there, and then blowing my brains out for as many people as possible to see in full, graphic detail.

then two things would be accomplished– a.) i can stop wasting resources that a better person probably deserves to use more than me, and b.) people might actually realize that suicide is a real, terrible thing, and that it happens every day, probably every few seconds.

i don't care if it traumatizes them. in fact, as sick as it sounds, i want it to. i want them to feel the pain that i feel due to living in a society that, for the most part, doesn't give two shits about mentally ill people. (insert joker meme here)

i want the people who saw it to lay awake in bed at night, unable to stop replaying it in their heads, thinking about how many other people this has happened to. every fucking day, suicides happen, and society doesn't give a single fuck, save for a few truly kind souls. i want it to fucking hurt. i want them to know how much it hurts.

that way, since i obviously can't accomplish anything with my life, i could at least accomplish something with my death.

maybe if there was enough publicity around it, it would actually move people to give a shit, preferably lawmakers (hence government buildings) so that some more provisions could be given to kids like me who struggle through what most people feel are the easiest things out there.

but you know what would be funny? if things stayed the same and nobody gave a shit anyways.

i once read an article about public suicide and about a newswoman who shot herself in the head on live television. that really fucking moved me and i respect the amount of courage that took. it's hard for me to talk about my mental state to my closest friend, let alone thousands of people.

please note that this is not a suicide PLAN. this is not something i'm actually planning on doing anytime soon. altruistic suicide is just some stupid fantasy of mine. i'm just a dumb edgy fuck.

sometimes when i feel like complete and utter garbage i fantasize about going on TV or in front of a government building or somewhere very public where potentially influential people could see me, and briefly explaining my situation and how it relates to all the other depressed kids out there, and then blowing my brains out for as many people as possible to see in full, graphic detail.

then two things would be accomplished– a.) i can stop wasting resources that a better person probably deserves to use more than me, and b.) people might actually realize that suicide is a real, terrible thing, and that it happens every day, probably every few seconds.

i don't care if it traumatizes them. in fact, as sick as it sounds, i want it to. i want them to feel the pain that i feel due to living in a society that, for the most part, doesn't give two shits about mentally ill people. (insert joker meme here)

i want the people who saw it to lay awake in bed at night, unable to stop replaying it in their heads, thinking about how many other people this has happened to. every fucking day, suicides happen, and society doesn't give a single fuck, save for a few truly kind souls. i want it to fucking hurt. i want them to know how much it hurts.

that way, since i obviously can't accomplish anything with my life, i could at least accomplish something with my death.

maybe if there was enough publicity around it, it would actually move people to give a shit, preferably lawmakers (hence government buildings) so that some more provisions could be given to kids like me who struggle through what most people feel are the easiest things out there.

but you know what would be funny? if things stayed the same and nobody gave a shit anyways.

i once read an article about public suicide and about a newswoman who shot herself in the head on live television. that really fucking moved me and i respect the amount of courage that took. it's hard for me to talk about my mental state to my closest friend, let alone thousands of people.

please note that this is not a suicide PLAN. this is not something i'm actually planning on doing anytime soon. altruistic suicide is just some stupid fantasy of mine. i'm just a dumb edgy fuck.

it's a shame that mentally ill people have to go so far as to fucking end their own lives in order to get others to believe that they're genuinely struggling."

I am Autistic and kind of at the end of my rope mentally.,"I was diagnosed at five years old, currently twenty four, and my life hasn't at all been an easy one. I live in the United States and there just wasn't a lot going on for autism awareness or how to handle kids with autism when I was growing up. On top of it all I grew with two sets of parents (mom and dad divorced) and it was absolutely poisonous. My mom and dad are both narcissists, they were constantly violent and dysfunctional with each other while they were together and dragged me into their screwed up issues and lives on top of me inheriting a disorder that neither of them have.   


I've been abused, insulted, neglected, had resentments held against me by my own mother, been bullied by people for being the weird kid who always cried in class, had meltdowns that would leave me screaming and crying, had to be put in special ed for a while, and spent the majority of my time friendless and alone just playing the same games, watching the same shows, and walking back and forth in my room for hours and hours a day. All at the same time the verbal and emotional abuse was endless, I was triggering Narcissists with no real self awareness and constantly consumed by rage.  


There appears to be a human element missing, something I don't have that I can't get, something I don't have that I'll never know I'm missing. I don't have the resolve, I don't have the will, I almost take pleasure in failing because it's all I seem capable of. I get tired easily, I can only focus on useless things, I dream of having a regular, peaceful life but the cognitive capacity eludes me. I keep inventing reasons to live, but my suffering causes me to to want to die. This existence is pointless, agonizing, and I only live for my own pleasure at the mercy of my survival instincts and only hoping my love of my closest loved ones can help me stay alive for a while longer.   


There's too much to say really, I don't think anyone has the time to read a book about my pain, this post might already be too long, but I just feel like typing because I'm hurting. I've been trying to get into a group home/mental institution because there are too many issues and I have no idea how to handle it. OCD, Anxiety, Major Depression Disorder, Sleep Issues, Attention Issues, Sensory Problems, weak family support, living in poverty, a desire to die but a conflicting hope for improvement. I feel my health is too far gone to have a real future, but I'm too cowardly to willingly bring about my death, but too scared to face more agony and even more afraid to put my pain on loved ones.   


I've been borderline homeless for a while, too ill to take care of myself but also too ill to handle the dysfunctions of those who have power over me. The mental health system hasn't been much help either, I simply need to find a group home and have myself squared away. I'm too tired to live, too scared to die, hopeful for a life I may never be capable of sustaining, terrified of an uncertain future on a planet falling into chaos and a country with a broken political system and weak safety nets. I don't want to commit suicide, I don't want to die, but nature hasn't endowed me with the circumstances to live upright, therefore I don't know if it is more reasonable to seek the end of my agony, I simply don't know.

"12 years of abuse, by 5 different men","Nothing is distracting me from my thoughts. I’ve been physically and mentally abused for 12 years with 5 different men. The relationship with the last guy just ended 3 days ago and the journey to self love is only getting worse for me, the day after I was upset but could distract myself, I knew it was the right thing. it’s day 3 and i can’t cope at all with anything that’s happening whatsoever. I can’t distract myself anymore. My brain is on over load. I can’t do drugs to numb myself because I have none and I have no money. I can’t drive my car to calm down because I have no money for gas. I have no money because of the abusive ex was an alcoholic and sucked me dry. I lost my self worth with him again like I did with all the other men, but I think it mainly started with the very first one, when I was 13. I’m 24 now. I thought since this keeps happening it must be my fault, so I unblocked and reached out to every ex since a lot of time has passed and asked them from what they can remember- what was wrong with me, why did they do the things they did , what did I do to push them so far, to just be as honest as possible and tell me everything that was actually wrong with me that caused the relationship to end up being the way it was. they all responded the same- telling me none of it was ever my fault, they all had demons and I was such a nice loving forgiving person they were able to let all their demons out on me and I stayed and tried to work with them, which only enabled them more and eventually they cheated. and that’s what caused me to leave them, the cheating. Not the abuse. Since I’ve been dealing with it so long I’m so used to it now, and I find love in it. I love my abuser, I love my ex, I want to die and I rather die from his abuse than killing myself. How many fucking years of therapy would it take to set my brain straight again? Probably till I’m 80 years old. This started when I was fucking 13/14.

One time his friends were around and he did it, I just allowed it and they tried breaking it up, but I didn’t want to leave. I loved my abusers when I was with them and I don’t know what to do about it.

I can't do this anymore,"I'm so sorry for the huge rant, but I feel like it's time to get this off my chest and talk to someone who really cares. TL;DR at the bottom.

I've been really suicidal for three years now. At first, it was on and off, the thoughts were really distressing but I could shove them away and focus on whatever else I had to get done. Of course, that didn't work for long, and about a year ago I started feeling intense urges to end my life. I couldn't focus on anything because my brain always came back to how I would kill myself.

Fast-forward to October of 2018. My world felt like it was falling apart; I had just discovered my sexuality (I am gay), people around me were making crude comments and inappropriate advances, such as touching, and I was generally so fed up with life. I remember reaching out to a teacher, who initially was very supportive. I was so happy to feel like someone understood me, but that all changed very quickly, as she told other teachers and the school counsellor. I lost all trust in my teachers, but a part of me chose to believe in the counsellor. I guess I believed she could have helped me.

I spent the next month largely in her small office, talking endlessly about the mistreatment from classmates and feelings I had bottled up. After talking to the students who were causing the biggest issues, she started entertaining the idea of telling my parents. I had gone to great lengths to hide everything from my parents, as I knew they would not understand the situation at all. We went back and forth for two months, which ended in her telling my parents secretly and despite my pleading not to.

When I got home that day, my parents immediately took me to my room and began to almost interrogate me. Was I really feeling this way? If so, why did I reach out to someone else first? Fearing my relationship with them would tank, I denied everything for the next two weeks. Around this time, we had an annual checkup coming up, and so I decided to wait until the checkup to discuss it further. I downloaded a mood tracker on my phone (Moodpath, I think) and completed the assessment in those two weeks.

Around this time, my parents became very religious and, fresh off healing cancer, wanted me to try some of their ""remedies."" The first time, I was told I didn't believe and God didn't accept my prayer because of it. So the second and third times, I believed. I put all my faith into being cured by God, but for some reason he never came through. This only left me feeling worse, and my parents continually accused me of lacking faith, and this was punishment for it.

Before we left for the appointment, my mom asked again if I actually felt helpless, down, anxious, and so on. I caved, and told her a little bit more about what had been happening. She nodded, told my dad and we drove to the appointment in silence. When I was called in, I asked if my parents could take a seat outside while I talked to the doctor, and he reluctantly agreed. I explained to the doctor everything I had been feeling, the inability to work, and showed him the mood assessment, as well. He read it over, nodded, and said he'd talk to my parents.

About ten minutes later, I'm called back in. He said he would refer me to a psychiatrist, but he also began an awkward, prying line of questioning. He said I was generally attractive, had decent grades and a good family life, and so I had no real reason to be depressed. I was angry, to say the least, and we left it at that. When we walked out the door, my parents mentioned the doctor saying there was ""no actual problem"", and all I needed was to spend more time with my parents.

Slowly but surely, things started ""getting better."" By April, I felt like life was manageable and I could work on long-term recovery. By June, I was vivacious and almost bouncing with happiness. I had restarted so many projects I previously ditched, and my work ethic soared. Friends said I was almost wired, but I brushed their concerns off entirely.

December came, and I was hit again. This time, it felt like I was hit by a truck, but pinned down underneath the back wheel; the sadness was crushing, mounting and it prevented me from functioning. In class, I took up all the work I could, but spent my nights crying in bed, pacing around impatiently trying to get the work done before it was due the next day. It was around this time I noticed a huge change in my thinking, as well; I have had odd and violent intrusive thoughts since as long as I can remember, but they were not as severe. When I was younger, I would associate certain words with pictures in my head, and anytime the word was said, the mental image came along with it. Around this time, the images shifted greatly, going from benign and often amusing to horrifying images of violence, often involving people I loved. This drove me nearly insane, and I knew I had to tell someone.

I remember sitting my mom down the day after Christmas, and before I got a single word out it was like a dam broke. I was trying my best to explain what I was going through, but my she kept pressuring me to say more and explain everything. For some reason, this really put me off telling her more, and cut it off early. She insisted she was taking this very seriously, and we would find someone to start treatment immediately.

About a week later, when I ask what the situation is looking like, I am told we can't find anyone right now and it might be a long time before we get in touch with someone who can help. Having done extensive research myself, I inform them about programs available at local hospitals, but they shrugged it off and told me to just wait. The more I insisted, the more agitated they became, and started to make up lies to put me off seeking treatment.

In January, we finally get to a psychiatrist. He seemed very concerned, and wanted me to come in immediately. I was given an appointment for about two weeks from the call, and things were definitely looking up. My parents continued to gaslight me, insisting I was making up the majority of my symptoms and to stop being so dramatic. The morning of the appointment, they said although I was completely fabricating my whole situation, they still were taking me to see a doctor because they loved me. In the waiting room, I was told by them to not explain the extent of my symptoms, and to even not discuss a few entirely.

To make an already long story a little shorter, I was diagnosed with severe OCD that afternoon. I was given a link, another appointment in two weeks, and the task of explaining to my parents what OCD was. Originally, they took it very well, and almost seemed understanding. We went back two weeks later, and we discussed medication. I was put on an SSRI, and given another appointment in two weeks.

Around this time, my friends described the same ""wired"" behaviour as I had experienced the past summer. I also noticed restless and irritable behaviour, which resulted in a number of people asking me if I was okay. My ability to focus literally vanished, and I was also quite euphoric, but dismissed it. When I saw the psychiatrist again, he mentioned I seemed very happy and energetic, but I just said I was having a good day. He reluctantly ramped up my dose and told me to call if it worsens.

A few days after the appointment, my sleep quality tanked. I was sleeping two hours a night, and waking up feeling like I was on crack cocaine. I begged my parents to call the psychiatrist, and it took an hour for them to relent. He was very concerned and told me to come in immediately. I was diagnosed with bipolar II and instructed to stop my medication immediately.

When my parents heard me describing my symptoms to the psychiatrist, they seemed livid. I was apparently trusting someone else more than them, and they needed someone to blame. Of course, what better target than my phone? It was the only logical explanation, in their minds, for the inability to sleep, euphoria, and goal-driven behaviour. Right after the appointment, they told me my phone would be taken every night at 7pm, and only returned to me at 7am.

When I went to the psychiatrist last week, he seemed fed up with seeing me. I asked him what our next steps were, and he said his hands were tied; my parents refused to ""medicate"" me until therapy was at least tried, and so he referred me to a psychologist who could do that. I'm still stuck here, with no appointment as of yet.

I have spent the last year talking to a local helpline basically every day, but it doesn't help anymore. Messages don't go through until they inform me they are ending the chat because I won't respond. I have to wait an hour from the time I text them to when I see a response. My friends have also been very unsupportive, oftentimes laughing at my diagnoses and making it a point to yell one out at random times. Other friends will tell me they're busy before I get a chance to tell them I'm struggling.

My parents have gone basically insane at this point. They now give me water with food colouring mixed in, supposedly to heal me. I also must wear a band on my arm at all times, except for showering. I am constantly gaslit, told I can't have a ""cleaning disease"" when my room is a mess, or when my marks are slipping.

I fear I won't make it longer than two weeks. I've started writing my suicide notes to the people I love and hate, and I'm looking into what to overdose on before I hang myself. I don't want to hurt anyone, but this is too much to handle. I can't take this anymore.

Thank you for whoever read through this tedious rant, it means the world to me and I can never thank you enough. Maybe I'll mention this in my suicide note, so they can see what it's like.

The Soothing Thought of Suicide,"Last night I had trouble sleeping. There was a flush of negative thoughts berating my mind. I couldn't help but to think that I'll live my whole life alone. I couldn't stop myself from thinking that I don't have any one who cares about me. I wasn't strong enough to fight these feelings. I feel alone. I feel like I have no friends. My family is so far away. I try so hard to fight the thoughts and tell myself that I can fight off the feeling, that I can learn to love myself and it will be enough.

Last night I have reached my limit. I can't fight it off anymore. I need help. I am coming here for emotional support. I'm afraid and I don't know what to do with my life. I am soon to graduate university with a loss of where to go because I have no one to follow. I have no friends and family to go to after I graduate. 

The only thing that could let me sleep is the thought of death. I told myself that I didn't have to put up with this for much longer. The only thing that could sooth me to sleep was the thought of suicide.

Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but some day soon I will take my life. This is what gave me the relief I needed to sleep.

Incoherent rant I just had to get out there,"I’m sick of fucking everything. My life fucking sucks because of me and me alone. I had everything going for me, I was born upper middle class to amazing parents who made sure I always knew I was loved. We never had monetary troubles and I’ve never had to worry about a serious thing in my life. I have great friends that I know are super kind to me. I don’t deserve any of that. I just want to die. I care about everything so fucking much and I just want my emotions to stop fucking controlling me. I have no motivation and I’m on Reddit most of the day. I don’t have the motivation to plan anything to do, and anything I do is always someone else’s idea (mostly my parents, my friends don’t invite me places much). I haven’t had a fucking idea in forever. I don’t think I’m really living now. I don’t notice things anymore, things just pass me by. I wish I could be more in tune with everything going on around me. I’m already 16 years old what the hell. I know that’s young as fuck but it’s still too old. I can’t imagine being an adult. I’ll have to do everything, and I can barely handle my minimal responsibilities now. I think I’ll have to die before then. The only thing that’s stopping me now is how people will think of me when I’m gone. I care what people think so fucking much. Too fucking much. I’d rather die than have a single person dislike me or think I’m less than normal. It’s irrational and I hate it. I hate how irrational I am. I don’t fucking know what my morals are anymore, I can’t keep track of anything. My memory’s gone to shit (prob something to do with the lack of doin fucking anything for the last bit).

I'm afraid I'm going to be the reason my girlfriend dies," TL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end. I'm conflicted on what to do.

This is the fourth time I've tried to write a post about my situation but each time it came out extremely messy and hard to read. That's why I'm going to try to divide my post into different sections this time in an attempt to make grasping everything easier for you (the reader) and myself to be completely honest.

# the relationship

My girlfriend (18) and I (18) started dating 2 years ago at 16 back in high school. We've had a very turbulent relationship with a lot of breaking and making up, intense love and our fair share of troubles. Maybe I'm just romanticizing the word toxicity but to be completely honest I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

We used to be extremely jealous of each other and sort of isolated our self from the world together. Thinking back I do regret this a lot. Due to our mix of toxicity and her depression we both suffered abuse from each other. It's crazy how an extreme love for a certain person can drive you insane and even make you do unloveable things to them.

In high school we used to spend almost everyday together and I loved it this changed after we went to college. When we graduated high school she went to Sweden for 7 weeks and we really started having a lot of relationship difficulties from there. I sort of started disconnecting and getting used to having more space. After she returned we noticed that we had both changed a lot and this led to a lot of fights but slowly but surely we kind of started having a healthy relationship. This took a lot of hard work, sacrifice and communication.

Everything changed when this happened however. Around the first year of the relationship we both promised each other to stop watching porn because it made us insecure. I did this for a long time but eventually relapsed around 8 times in the span of a year and never told her. She eventually had a suspicion and confronted me, I confessed and everything just went extremely downhill from there. She was really hurt and even more so about the fact that I hid it from her and was never planning on telling. We broke up after this but got back together after a couple weeks had gone by. Her trust however was never the same (and rightfully so).

# Her situation/depression

My girlfriend originally started suffering from depression at 16 due to her birth control pills. I've been supporting her ever since. The first months it was really bad and she even tried taking her own life with sleeping pills she saved up. I called emergency services when this happened and she was taken to the hospital and given mental treatment after this all happened. There was a big problem however when she came home.

After hating me for a couple of days and wishing that I didn't call emergency services she finally told me the real reason why she wanted to die. It turns out that she was a gypsy, a Romani. And in their culture children have to be in arranged marriages at extremely young ages. Now its 16/18 but it used to be a lot younger. And it has to be with another gypsy otherwise the female is considered a whore and an outsider and is shunned by the entire family. I always thought that my girlfriend had strict parents but never to this extent I never asked any questions about why they couldn't know about us but now I knew.

She always had a really good relationship with her mom but after the day she tried to commit suicide their relationship was strained for a very long time. Her mother (father is out of the picture) didn't believe in mental health and thought she was doing this to get attention which of course triggered my girlfriend even more. She also could never tell the full story to her mental health counselors because they would have to enable child protective services.

She eventually made the choice to run away with me. But she seemed very conflicted about this and kind of flip flopped between staying with her mom and living for her and being with me. A lot of the times she did not want to make a choice because she felt she would be unhappy in both situations. A loveless (probably abusive) arranged marriage or an unstable relationship with me. She convinced herself dying was the best option eventually. I talked her out of it so many times and truly tried supporting her through everything. This took a large toll on me as she would often be really abusive.

Everything changed when I cheated however. She told me in the weeks that we broke up that I was the reason she was going to die and I was her only chance at a normal life. I tried to convince her otherwise but she just won't listen. After we got back together she told me she was going to die regardless of her relationship and she's just waiting for the right time. When I begged her not to she refused to change her choice and told me it was going to happen this year and I get to choose to be with her till the end or leave. When I asked why she said because I cheated and we would never be the same after this anyway.

I thought I could change her mind at first but I can't. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I see a future with this girl but she doesn't with me. I told her I'm going to think about my choice and she called me selfish. Supporting her through all of those years of this took a toll on my sanity,sleep and social life. I can't sit there and be with her until she dies. I don't understand how she wants to take me back after everything but doesn't want to run away with me anymore. I'm confused tired and stressed out. I've never talked about this with anyone and I just need to hear someone else's opinion on this.

# My final decision

I still havent decided what to do and told her I want to think about this long and hard. She told me I was selfish and compared me to the devil for leaving her with the depression and letting her die alone. I really need some advice.

I really don't want to be a temporary comfort for her I just can't. I love her to death and want to grow old with her and have a good relationship. I would permanently lose my sanity if I stayed I'm afraid but I also don't want to leave her like this.

I know a large part of our relationship troubles seem really immature and they are. But we were both really young and we still are and these are all just extremely hard choices to make at this age.",t2_5vn91nzw,3,0,0,"I'm afraid I'm going to be the reason my girlfriend dies  TL;DR: My girlfriend is going to kill herself and wants me to be with her till the end.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,1867,0,1,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.

I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked,"So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. 

When she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.

So fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.

TL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.

Edit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things.",t2_2cd736ed,712,0,1,"I’m going to a psychiatrist for the first time and I’m a little freaked So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago.

She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things."

I wonder what he was thinking and feeling.

"Just a small venting, if you dont mind","These last 12 months, my whole life kind of flipped. It turned out for the better, and I couldnt be more thankful.

How can one person make you want to die .,"I have this “friend” and I really am starting to hate her. I’ve really only been nice to her. We were both in a friend group and when the friend group split up she was having trouble finding friend so she stayed with me because we didn’t have any beef unlike the other people. And I had quite a lot of friends, but when she came she kinda took them from me like they started not talking to me and started texting her and talking to her lunch. So now I am really alone. For her birthday I wanted her to know I still liked her so I got her a lot of stuff, and she gave me hot sauce packets from the lunches. She is pretty rich, so I don’t see why she couldn’t have given me something that actually has value, since I gave her $30+ worth of stuff. And I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while now, and she just me 10x worse. Her thing is if she doesn’t get what she wants from you, she whines for a bit calls you mean then goes and talks behind your back. That’s how I lost some friends, because I didn’t pay for her stuff. She didn’t have enough money, and I only had enough for myself. She got all pissed and started her whines and shit. I’m done with her, but there is no escaping her hell, she has all my closest friends in her palm. One word said about me I’ll lose all of them. She thinks she’s better than every one else, prettier, skinner. Her being 85 pounds still saying everyday “I’m so fat omg”. She always says her hairs bad and her face is ugly and round everyday. She always says she doesn’t have friends when she took all my friends making them dislike me so she can have more friends. She has probably 50+ friends now, always has someone to talk to, always texting someone. Gets a lot of bday and Christmas presents. Likes to rub it in that’s she’s better than me.   You are probably like, “just find some new friends!” You see I can’t, my school is small and has little people. And everyone else are ghetto girls and “hot Cheeto girls”. I’m stuck in this hell for 2 more years. My family is messed up, my parents hate me, think I’m a disgrace. They ignore me everyday, all they do is send me to school, pick me up. And they manage to do that without saying a word to me. My grades are horrible, I will probably never get in college which will upset my family even more. I have no talents, nothing to live for. I have no real friends, but I’m scared of loneliness. I want to escape this hell. I want to die. I feel like I won’t live past 20.

I have no real friends, but I’m scared of loneliness. I want to escape this hell. I want to die. I feel like I won’t live past 20.

If you have wasted your time on me, thank you so much for listening to my problems. 

thank you!"

Depressed with good reason?,"Hello all.

My story made as short as possible.
40 yrs old

6 or 7 find out I'm G/R colorblind

7 find it I'm dyslexic as well

Up till about 11 I was sexually abused by Ann old family member

14 parents separated father became part time

17 first spine surgery for a herniated disc groom a MVA in which I was a passenger

20-24 I underwent 4 mite some surgeries, and then was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at 24 yrs old (turns out probably didn't need all of those surgeries as it was MS symptoms not some issues for some things)

36-One highlight in the last 20 years or so is I achieved a bachelor's degree which was something I very much wanted to do. Sadly I'm indebted for eternity and no better off for it outside of its something I wanted to do. 

Now I'm 40 have zero savings on soc sec and don't see much of a future. Once my land lady dies (she is 95) I'll likely end up homeless. 

I'm fucking depressed. I live in a society that has little sympathy for the chronically ill. I'm constantly in pain from the spine surgeries I probably didn't need. It's just wrong to have to live a life of indignity because I was born with fucked  immune system. 

My father is wealthy enough he could help some... but that's out if the question I guess.

Your ‘impossible task’,"https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/depression-impossible-task-symptoms-sadness-twitter-a8515436.html%3famp
Do you have an impossible task? Have you been able to get past it? How?

For me it’s applying for jobs. I currently work 2 12 hour night shifts a week. I know it doesn’t sound like much, but night shift when you’re already dealing with MDD, anxiety, OCD and anorexia is horrific. Not to mention I’ve had to deal with so many awful people who have destroyed what limited confidence I had to begin with. I feel scared before every shift, and my dread begins all over again the moment I walk out of the lab. I’ve been at the job two years, over which time the MDD has gotten far worse and I’ve tried to kill myself twice, landing myself in hospital against my will three times. EVERYONE in my life has said I need to get out of it. 

The problem? CV and cover letter. That’s it. I can work 12 hour night shifts. I run marathons. I starve myself for days on end. I attained a degree in Biomedical Science. But sitting down for 1-2 hours to write a cover letter? Impossible. I just can’t. And I can’t explain why. The only reason I got this job is because I did heaps of work experience with them first. And before that I did conservation work at a wetland during the Australian summer despite having severe allergies and cholinergic urticaria. I knew it would be hell physically. But I went for it simply because it didn’t require a cover letter. That’s it.

"How can i come back from this. I [24f] hate myself and a lot of my depression and anxiety stems from this. I know it's a lot to read, but if i can get any advice, it would really save me. Thanks.","When i first broke up with chris (my bf of 5 years), I wanted to break up with him because since summer, my feelings for him started to waver. I was always sad that I felt like he wasn’t affectionate enough or took the time to really treat me like a girlfriend. For me, I’m always telling him i love him and wanting to kiss and cuddle, but i felt like it was lacking from him. In addition, I don’t know why, but i started to feel attraction towards other guys and it terrified me. I felt so guilty about it that i had to let chris know. I felt like i was falling out of love and didn’t want him to be stuck in a relationship with me that would be unfair to him as well. I felt like he deserved someone who also loved him in the same way. During this time, we would still hang out in the same friend group. He still wanted to be friends with me, so i agreed. He even let me stay at his place still, when he had friends over (this is my first mistake, I should have said no, but i also still loved him as a friend so it was always nice to still be with him, selfish of me). During this time though, he got super protective over me and still expected me to be his girlfriend, even though i made it clear that i didn’t feel the same anymore. I thought my relationship with his friends were platonic and harmless (and some of them i was friends with on my own accord). But he was so mad when he found out that I would hang out without him (even though, I would plan on seeing him later with them as well) he would get mad if I wouldn’t be back at a certain time. It was my fault for allowing myself to stay over. I probably gave him the wrong ideas. But he would get so angry and lash out at me, and curse at me and call me names. I’ll admit, my intentions weren’t alway pure. I would invite him to things with our friends still, but lowkey didn’t want him to come because I wanted to be independent without him. I wanted to know what it would be like to be single without his presence. He would get so mad when I wasn’t responding this one time. I invited him at first out of courtesy, but it was fucked up of me to not respond or respond late because I couldn’t decide if I actually wanted him there. Totally my fault and I feel awful about it. I was being selfish. The next day when I saw him, he was so angry and vehement, he threw his phone across the room and it accidentally hit me. It made a gigantic bruise on my thigh and i got scared. Later on, we went on a group tahoe trip. He was complaining that I wasn’t paying enough attention to him, but that wasn’t the case, he just wanted to believe what he wanted to and made a huge scene and hit the wall. I was so angry because it felt like he wanted to control me so i would purposely go out, when he would be in the room and vise versa just to show him that i didn’t care. We were already sleeping in the same bed, which is what he requested from me so i complied (this was a vicious cycle of feeling bad for him and not thinking about the implications of what it meant to say “yes”). I’m stupid and should have just cut off everything from him since i knew he still had feelings. For some reason i thought it could somehow still work if we were still friends somehow which was naive and dumb of me. I finally moved into my own apartment and stopped staying at his place. But he would still force his presence and drive to my apartment without my permission. During this time, i didn’t realize it, but i had feelings for one of his friends. I felt awful about it, and didn’t know what to do. I knew he liked me too, because he confessed to chris that he did and felt guilty about it. I felt the same way, and told him how i felt. We ended up becoming a thing and this is when i started distancing myself from chris. I would see him every now and then during group gatherings and other obligations. I knew if we were still going to be in the same friend group i had to tell him that him that the other guy and i were a thing. I ended up sending him a letter telling him that I have feelings for the other guy and that i'm incredibly sorry that i feel this way (i didn’t want to tell him we were already a thing because i was too afraid to hurt his feelings). When i told him, he drove to my place and told me to get in the car. During this time, he went beserk. He drove the car around like crazy, threw my phone out the window and threatened to end my life, leak my old nudes, and expose me to my parents. He dug his nails into my skin really hard out of anger. He ended up feeling bad and found my phone and gave it to me. After this i stopped seeing him. However, me and the other guy that i had a thing with ended up not being compatible. He ended up sexually assaulting me. He would come back to my place several times that night and was hitting the windows multiple times to try to get me out, even though I had fled to my friend’s place. My roommate texted and warned me about this. I would report this to the police the next day. That night, the other guy also ran into chris at the gym. He was drunk and belligerent and ended up telling chris that we had been a thing. chris called me in panic, I told him we had been seeing each other, but no other details. I was so disgruntled and had no one to turn to that I also told him about the assault. After hearing this, of course, he was furious and went to go try to beat him up. The other guy called me and told me to lie about the assault and to tell chris that i didn’t, so he wouldn’t get beat up. I felt so awful, this was definitely the lowest point of my life so far. chris felt bad and offered me to stay at his place for comfort and even told me that he doesn’t expect me to get back with him. I eventually told him that him and i had been in a relationship and had intercourse. This broke his heart and he told me that to make him feel better about this that he wanted to do it with me and in a sense “reclaim me.” I accepted this because I felt like it was the least i could do in order to make up for hurting him like this (i know, this was a really messed up way of thinking). Afterwards, everything was so fucked up that i told him that it’s probably best i didn’t stay at his place anymore, even though i appreciated his offer so much. After this, the other guy reached out to try to apologize properly. I agreed to see him to receive this apology, and he did apologize, but not really in the way that i wanted to. He kissed me and i fell for it. I thought he was genuine. But the next morning, i realized he wasn't. After i went to edc with my friends, i actually met up with chris because we always dreamed about edc so we thought meeting up for a day would only be proper. After coming back from edc with my friends, i realized that i was an idiot, completely stupid, and believed in the other guy when he wasn’t sorry at all. I texted him calling him out and saying that i’m better off without him. I blocked him from everything. chris found out about this from another friend and went beserk again. I don’t blame him, it was my fault again. He went to my house at 2am and told my parents everything that’s been going on.

One of the biggest things that i’ve learned from this experience is to just be more considerate of people’s feelings. My whole life actually, i’ve been a really nice person and super considerate of others, so it just shocks me to my core looking back how i didn’t consider chris’s feelings as much as i should have. I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life. I made mistake after mistake because of selfish reasons. I’m trying to move past this, and i think the first step is writing it down. A lot of my anxiety has come from the trauma that these events caused. I hope that by writing this down, I can be more honest with myself and understand these feelings of mine. For a while i was running away from this guilt, but I need to own up to it so that i never make these mistakes again. I hope that by materializing these thoughts, I can also make a more active progression to change. I have been dealing with so much self-loathing and hate for myself because i just know how fucked up everything got. Just reading this leaves me in bewilderment.

After things settled down, chris and tried to give our relationship another chance. We’ve been trying new things to work on attraction, and since he’s been so nice to me, it’s been progressing. Despite everything, i’ve known him for almost 6 years and i care and love him so much that life seems unbearable without him. He has forgiven me, but i can’t seem to forgive myself just yet. I want to be a better person, and i want to not let these acts define me (but what if i deserve to let it define me?). But sometimes, it’s hard because my anxiety from all this comes back. I feel sometimes like i don’t deserve chris. I fucked up, so i should live with the consequences. I feel so worthless that i get anxiety attacks. I have overcome this a bit through time, but it seeps back every now and then. This is interfering with the current relationship that I want to work out because if this guilt is always plaguing me, I feel like i can’t fully be present in my relationship now. I know most of you might not be able to sympathize with me, but i just need advice. It has been almost a year since all of this transpired. I have a much better support system of friends that i've never had before that i can convincingly say i know got my back, and am in a better place, so I do feel very grateful about this. I just feel so down about myself at times. Prior to all of this, my life has always been non-problematic and i've always had a good moral compass on my shoulder. However, i just can't help but feel so worthless at times. But any words of encouragement would help if you see fit. Sometimes it still feels like im hanging by a thread here.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: BIG SIDE NOTE. The worst part about everything is that I lost my entire group of friends that i made through them. I was dishonest at first about me and the other guys’ relationship because i was scared. But after they found out i was in a relationship with him and that i got assaulted, they all just blamed us for keeping our relationship a secret and didn’t think much of the assault just because we were in a relationship already. This was a big part of why i wanted to die for a while as well (should have added this in). It propelled me into feeling more worthless and unheard than ever before (please any advice on getting over carrying resentment for this would be amazing). I also think that i just have this undying love for chris because of how long i’ve know him, and try to understand him because i just feel so guilty of everything i inflicted. I want to go to therapy but right now it’s not at option so resorting to reddit. A thousand thank yous to people who took the time to read - you're amazing.

I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life. I made mistake after mistake because of selfish reasons. I’m trying to move past this, and i think the first step is writing it down. A lot of my anxiety has come from the trauma that these events caused. I hope that by writing this down, I can be more honest with myself and understand these feelings of mine. For a while i was running away from this guilt, but I need to own up to it so that i never make these mistakes again. I hope that by materializing these thoughts, I can also make a more active progression to change. I have been dealing with so much self-loathing and hate for myself because i just know how fucked up everything got. Just reading this leaves me in bewilderment.

After things settled down, chris and tried to give our relationship another chance. We’ve been trying new things to work on attraction, and since he’s been so nice to me, it’s been progressing. Despite everything, i’ve known him for almost 6 years and i care and love him so much that life seems unbearable without him. He has forgiven me, but i can’t seem to forgive myself just yet. I want to be a better person, and i want to not let these acts define me (but what if i deserve to let it define me?). But sometimes, it’s hard because my anxiety from all this comes back. I feel sometimes like i don’t deserve chris. I fucked up, so i should live with the consequences. I feel so worthless that i get anxiety attacks. I have overcome this a bit through time, but it seeps back every now and then. This is interfering with the current relationship that I want to work out because if this guilt is always plaguing me, I feel like i can’t fully be present in my relationship now. I know most of you might not be able to sympathize with me, but i just need advice. It has been almost a year since all of this transpired. I have a much better support system of friends that i've never had before that i can convincingly say i know got my back, and am in a better place, so I do feel very grateful about this. I just feel so down about myself at times. Prior to all of this, my life has always been non-problematic and i've always had a good moral compass on my shoulder. However, i just can't help but feel so worthless at times. But any words of encouragement would help if you see fit. Sometimes it still feels like im hanging by a thread here.

Edit: BIG SIDE NOTE. The worst part about everything is that I lost my entire group of friends that i made through them. I was dishonest at first about me and the other guys’ relationship because i was scared. But after they found out i was in a relationship with him and that i got assaulted, they all just blamed us for keeping our relationship a secret and didn’t think much of the assault just because we were in a relationship already. This was a big part of why i wanted to die for a while as well (should have added this in). It propelled me into feeling more worthless and unheard than ever before (please any advice on getting over carrying resentment for this would be amazing). I also think that i just have this undying love for chris because of how long i’ve know him, and try to understand him because i just feel so guilty of everything i inflicted. I want to go to therapy but right now it’s not at option so resorting to reddit. A thousand thank yous to people who took the time to read - you're amazing.

I wish i had friends,"(To start off I’m 16, male, haven’t been to school for a couple years for these reasons) So idk if this belongs here it’s just a rant pretty pointless but recently I’ve been feeling somewhat depressed, a few years ago I ended up developing social anxiety and isolated myself from the littlest of friends that I had at the time.
Recently I’ve been seeing a therapist and I’ve started feeling a little better and started leaving the house, only issue is idrk how to interact with people so it’s pretty hard for me to make friends  especially with not being in school

Not too long ago someone I knew on Snapchat ended up being a real dick and told me no one would ever want to be friends with me for reasons she wouldn’t say (?) so that has made me feel like total shit for about a week.
Anyways I went out yesterday and I came across someone I used to know as a kid, wasn’t really ever friends but we knew each other. We talked for a while and he put his number in my phone. The thing is, the number isn’t in service and he typed it fast so I’m not sure if he gave me a fake number or fucked it up by typing it so fast.

I was in that area this afternoon and I decided to leave a note in his door saying that the number said it wasn’t in service and left my number at the bottom. It’s late at night now and I still haven’t heard from him. 

I’m probably overreacting and he probably did just put it in wrong, but he did it really fast so idk. I feel like he gave me a fake number but he’s the one who talked to me and offered me his number, so idk why he’d give me a fake one 🤷‍♂️

Ugh I just feel like no one likes me or wants to talk to me and it’s been making me feel more and more depressed, I just feel like I’ll always be lonely and live a shitty life.

What is happening to me,"Trigger warning: non consensual touching

Recently I was non consensually touched by one of my closest friends. We were drunk but he thought I was asleep when he touched me. Ever since, even though I have told school and my family and friends know, I haven’t been able to be truly happy. Nothing feels the same anymore, I shut myself off and don’t talk to anyone. I literally only reply to my boyfriends messages with “okay”. My parents are supportive but I can’t tell them what I’m feeling. I just feel so empty inside and making myself sad is so much better than the pure emptiness and nothingness that I usually feel. I have thought about hurting myself, and I searched my room for something to use but I couldn’t find anything. I don’t want to be that desperate to hurt myself again but it will happen.

Nothing satisfies me.,"Growing up i allways felt like an outsider. It would take me allot longer to interact with other kids, as if i was first observing behaviour and judging before i could relate and connect with them. Everything felt like it was missing a piece and just because ""things happen"" wasnt acceptable to me. So i grew up analyzing soo much so so much that i lack that guillable and ignorant way of enjoying little things in life... I actually envy one friend in particular in which i deem the dumbest of us.. He can blabber, get amazed, shocked, worried about relatively nonsense things HE CAN actually small talk. So ive allways known i have a different perspective in life i am Now im 25 and feel like i got a hold of myself... To a point but in was in my highschool years i went through the typical crush then gf then betrayed scenario (happens to almost every1), that my out of the normal rational spiraled out of my control. Kept analyzing Every Single Detailed that happened day by day, in the hopes that id find paterns to correct myself. It felt like i was talking to myself saying ""you're in this sad state, and its only you're fault. You're the one who keeps getting into this... How about you unfuck yourself"". And so to avoid putting myself in situations in which i didnt feel comfortable i turned to educating myself HARD.. On how to read peoples posture, body language, tone of voice. Some would say it completley messed me up as a human, on the bright side though, i am confident enough to sit at a poker table, whilest cocky enough that i wont loose. And so about 3 - 5 times a year i get into unsatisfying state where theres nothing i can do which causes pleasure. I can now feel creep on me. Tend to start masturbating more, spending more money, sleeping more, reading more, playing video games more. I know how to handle it so i can damage control, tend to sleep more and educate myself with youtube or reading articles so i can indulge whilest keeping it away from my pocket. And while i can somewhat handle it i cant actually neither prevent it or end it. like its coming, so brace for impact. Its here, so deal with it. Its gone, try to enjoy anything...

"I’m having one of those nights where i feel like dying rn. I [24f] hate myself and a lot of my depression and anxiety stems from this. I know it's a lot to read, but if i can get any advice, it would really save me, thanks.","When i first broke up with chris (my bf of 5 years), I wanted to break up with him because since summer, my feelings for him started to waver. I was always sad that I felt like he wasn’t affectionate enough or took the time to really treat me like a girlfriend. For me, I’m always telling him i love him and wanting to kiss and cuddle, but i felt like it was lacking from him. In addition, I don’t know why, but i started to feel attraction towards other guys and it terrified me. I felt so guilty about it that i had to let chris know. I felt like i was falling out of love and didn’t want him to be stuck in a relationship with me that would be unfair to him as well. I felt like he deserved someone who also loved him in the same way. During this time, we would still hang out in the same friend group. He still wanted to be friends with me, so i agreed. He even let me stay at his place still, when he had friends over (this is my first mistake, I should have said no, but i also still loved him as a friend so it was always nice to still be with him, selfish of me). During this time though, he got super protective over me and still expected me to be his girlfriend, even though i made it clear that i didn’t feel the same anymore. I thought my relationship with his friends were platonic and harmless (and some of them i was friends with on my own accord). But he was so mad when he found out that I would hang out without him (even though, I would plan on seeing him later with them as well) he would get mad if I wouldn’t be back at a certain time. It was my fault for allowing myself to stay over. I probably gave him the wrong ideas. But he would get so angry and lash out at me, and curse at me and call me names. I’ll admit, my intentions weren’t alway pure. I would invite him to things with our friends still, but lowkey didn’t want him to come because I wanted to be independent without him. I wanted to know what it would be like to be single without his presence. He would get so mad when I wasn’t responding this one time. I invited him at first out of courtesy, but it was fucked up of me to not respond or respond late because I couldn’t decide if I actually wanted him there. Totally my fault and I feel awful about it. I was being selfish. The next day when I saw him, he was so angry and vehement, he threw his phone across the room and it accidentally hit me. It made a gigantic bruise on my thigh and i got scared. Later on, we went on a group tahoe trip. He was complaining that I wasn’t paying enough attention to him, but that wasn’t the case, he just wanted to believe what he wanted to and made a huge scene and hit the wall. I was so angry because it felt like he wanted to control me so i would purposely go out, when he would be in the room and vise versa just to show him that i didn’t care. We were already sleeping in the same bed, which is what he requested from me so i complied (this was a vicious cycle of feeling bad for him and not thinking about the implications of what it meant to say “yes”). I’m stupid and should have just cut off everything from him since i knew he still had feelings. For some reason i thought it could somehow still work if we were still friends somehow which was naive and dumb of me. I finally moved into my own apartment and stopped staying at his place. But he would still force his presence and drive to my apartment without my permission. During this time, i didn’t realize it, but i had feelings for one of his friends. I felt awful about it, and didn’t know what to do. I knew he liked me too, because he confessed to chris that he did and felt guilty about it. I felt the same way, and told him how i felt. We ended up becoming a thing and this is when i started distancing myself from chris. I would see him every now and then during group gatherings and other obligations. I knew if we were still going to be in the same friend group i had to tell him that him that the other guy and i were a thing. I ended up sending him a letter telling him that I have feelings for the other guy and that i'm incredibly sorry that i feel this way (i didn’t want to tell him we were already a thing because i was too afraid to hurt his feelings). When i told him, he drove to my place and told me to get in the car. During this time, he went beserk. He drove the car around like crazy, threw my phone out the window and threatened to end my life, leak my old nudes, and expose me to my parents. He dug his nails into my skin really hard out of anger. He ended up feeling bad and found my phone and gave it to me. After this i stopped seeing him. However, me and the other guy that i had a thing with ended up not being compatible. He ended up sexually assaulting me. He would come back to my place several times that night and was hitting the windows multiple times to try to get me out, even though I had fled to my friend’s place. My roommate texted and warned me about this. I would report this to the police the next day. That night, the other guy also ran into chris at the gym. He was drunk and belligerent and ended up telling chris that we had been a thing. chris called me in panic, I told him we had been seeing each other, but no other details. I was so disgruntled and had no one to turn to that I also told him about the assault. After hearing this, of course, he was furious and went to go try to beat him up. The other guy called me and told me to lie about the assault and to tell chris that i didn’t, so he wouldn’t get beat up. I felt so awful, this was definitely the lowest point of my life so far. chris felt bad and offered me to stay at his place for comfort and even told me that he doesn’t expect me to get back with him. I eventually told him that him and i had been in a relationship and had intercourse. This broke his heart and he told me that to make him feel better about this that he wanted to do it with me and in a sense “reclaim me.” I accepted this because I felt like it was the least i could do in order to make up for hurting him like this (i know, this was a really messed up way of thinking). Afterwards, everything was so fucked up that i told him that it’s probably best i didn’t stay at his place anymore, even though i appreciated his offer so much. After this, the other guy reached out to try to apologize properly. I agreed to see him to receive this apology, and he did apologize, but not really in the way that i wanted to. He kissed me and i fell for it. I thought he was genuine. But the next morning, i realized he wasn't. After i went to edc with my friends, i actually met up with chris because we always dreamed about edc so we thought meeting up for a day would only be proper. After coming back from edc with my friends, i realized that i was an idiot, completely stupid, and believed in the other guy when he wasn’t sorry at all. I texted him calling him out and saying that i’m better off without him. I blocked him from everything. chris found out about this from another friend and went beserk again. I don’t blame him, it was my fault again. He went to my house at 2am and told my parents everything that’s been going on.

One of the biggest things that i’ve learned from this experience is to just be more considerate of people’s feelings. My whole life actually, i’ve been a really nice person and super considerate of others, so it just shocks me to my core looking back how i didn’t consider chris’s feelings as much as i should have. I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life.

I felt awful about it, and didn’t know what to do. I knew he liked me too, because he confessed to chris that he did and felt guilty about it. I felt the same way, and told him how i felt. We ended up becoming a thing and this is when i started distancing myself from chris. I would see him every now and then during group gatherings and other obligations. I knew if we were still going to be in the same friend group i had to tell him that him that the other guy and i were a thing. I ended up sending him a letter telling him that I have feelings for the other guy and that i'm incredibly sorry that i feel this way (i didn’t want to tell him we were already a thing because i was too afraid to hurt his feelings). When i told him, he drove to my place and told me to get in the car. During this time, he went beserk. He drove the car around like crazy, threw my phone out the window and threatened to end my life, leak my old nudes, and expose me to my parents. He dug his nails into my skin really hard out of anger. He ended up feeling bad and found my phone and gave it to me. After this i stopped seeing him. However, me and the other guy that i had a thing with ended up not being compatible. He ended up sexually assaulting me. He would come back to my place several times that night and was hitting the windows multiple times to try to get me out, even though I had fled to my friend’s place. My roommate texted and warned me about this. I would report this to the police the next day. That night, the other guy also ran into chris at the gym. He was drunk and belligerent and ended up telling chris that we had been a thing. chris called me in panic, I told him we had been seeing each other, but no other details. I was so disgruntled and had no one to turn to that I also told him about the assault. After hearing this, of course, he was furious and went to go try to beat him up. The other guy called me and told me to lie about the assault and to tell chris that i didn’t, so he wouldn’t get beat up. I felt so awful, this was definitely the lowest point of my life so far. chris felt bad and offered me to stay at his place for comfort and even told me that he doesn’t expect me to get back with him. I eventually told him that him and i had been in a relationship and had intercourse. This broke his heart and he told me that to make him feel better about this that he wanted to do it with me and in a sense “reclaim me.” I accepted this because I felt like it was the least i could do in order to make up for hurting him like this (i know, this was a really messed up way of thinking). Afterwards, everything was so fucked up that i told him that it’s probably best i didn’t stay at his place anymore, even though i appreciated his offer so much. After this, the other guy reached out to try to apologize properly. I agreed to see him to receive this apology, and he did apologize, but not really in the way that i wanted to. He kissed me and i fell for it. I thought he was genuine. But the next morning, i realized he wasn't. After i went to edc with my friends, i actually met up with chris because we always dreamed about edc so we thought meeting up for a day would only be proper. After coming back from edc with my friends, i realized that i was an idiot, completely stupid, and believed in the other guy when he wasn’t sorry at all. I texted him calling him out and saying that i’m better off without him. I blocked him from everything. chris found out about this from another friend and went beserk again. I don’t blame him, it was my fault again. He went to my house at 2am and told my parents everything that’s been going on.

One of the biggest things that i’ve learned from this experience is to just be more considerate of people’s feelings. My whole life actually, i’ve been a really nice person and super considerate of others, so it just shocks me to my core looking back how i didn’t consider chris’s feelings as much as i should have. I was too focused on being angry at him for wanting to control me that i couldn’t understand why he was being the way he was. I know i fucked up a lot during this time in my life. I made mistake after mistake because of selfish reasons. I’m trying to move past this, and i think the first step is writing it down. A lot of my anxiety has come from the trauma that these events caused. I hope that by writing this down, I can be more honest with myself and understand these feelings of mine. For a while i was running away from this guilt, but I need to own up to it so that i never make these mistakes again. I hope that by materializing these thoughts, I can also make a more active progression to change. I have been dealing with so much self-loathing and hate for myself because i just know how fucked up everything got. Just reading this leaves me in bewilderment.

After things settled down, chris and tried to give our relationship another chance. We’ve been trying new things to work on attraction, and since he’s been so nice to me, it’s been progressing. Despite everything, i’ve known him for almost 6 years and i care and love him so much that life seems unbearable without him. He has forgiven me, but i can’t seem to forgive myself just yet. I want to be a better person, and i want to not let these acts define me (but what if i deserve to let it define me?). But sometimes, it’s hard because my anxiety from all this comes back. I feel sometimes like i don’t deserve chris. I fucked up, so i should live with the consequences. I feel so worthless that i get anxiety attacks. I have overcome this a bit through time, but it seeps back every now and then. This is interfering with the current relationship that I want to work out because if this guilt is always plaguing me, I feel like i can’t fully be present in my relationship now. I know most of you might not be able to sympathize with me, but i just need advice. It has been almost a year since all of this transpired. I have a much better support system of friends that i've never had before that i can convincingly say i know got my back, and am in a better place, so I do feel very grateful about this. I just feel so down about myself at times. Prior to all of this, my life has always been non-problematic and i've always had a good moral compass on my shoulder. However, i just can't help but feel so worthless at times. But any words of encouragement would help if you see fit. Sometimes it still feels like im hanging by a thread here.


Edit: BIG SIDE NOTE. The worst part about everything is that I lost my entire group of friends that i made through them. I was dishonest at first about me and the other guys’ relationship because i was scared. But after they found out i was in a relationship with him and that i got assaulted, they all just blamed us for keeping our relationship a secret and didn’t think much of the assault just because we were in a relationship already. This was a big part of why i wanted to die for a while as well (should have added this in). It propelled me into feeling more worthless and unheard than ever before (PLEASE any advice on getting over carrying resentment for this would be amazing). I also think that i just have this undying love for chris because of how long i’ve know him, and try to understand him because i just feel so guilty of everything i inflicted. I want to go to therapy but right now it’s not at option so resorting to reddit. A thousand thank yous to people who took the time to read - you're amazing. 


TL:DR this is a long diary of why i have depression and anxiety, hoping for any advice. thank you."
Do you feel like there should be a word for something worse and deeper than depression?,"I feel like I've been at all different levels of depressed at some point in time.

Im not in a state to help my suicidal friend,"For context, im 16 years old, my friend is 19 and lives on her own in another country so keep that in mind. 

Almsot 3 days ago she texted me that she was going to kill herself, she was very clear about how she was going to do it, how im should let her go, how "" it's not respectful to ask someone to live if their life isn't liveable"", you know, the whole ""im going to take all the pills- it's not working i didn't take enough- im gonna try stabbing myself- I'll sit outside until i freeze to death "" line. Ofc i was calling her and i actually texted her ex to call an ambulance( he's the only person i can contact in her country and he knows where she lives) but he didn't read it and i deleted it once i realized she'll survive. She's alive obviously and is acting like nothing happened.

This is a cycle, she find someone to date, things are seemingly well and so is her mental health, it doesn't work out, she's suicidal, after 2 weeks, she starts talking to people again and doing risky things. She got drunk as fuck, she said she's meeting with a guy at his place and i think he's from tinder so that's not safe. Im tired, she's always dismissive of her feelings or expresses them in very concerning ""jokes"" ( i get it, coping mechanism but it's harmful if that's all you do).

this is where i get off,"i think it’s really time for me this time. i can’t do this anymore. 

i was born in an abusive family, i don’t really feel like providing extensive backstory, but it was bad enough and weird enough that many people throughout my life don’t believe me, and those who have believed me don’t know what to do with me or what to even say. i have been suicidal since i was 7 years old. earlier than that i can remember not wanting to exist but not really being able to articulate it. now as an adult i’m in a terrible, very long term relationship with someone who’s also abusive, in a different way. i don’t go a day without arguing with him several times. it’s always the same shit. it’s practically scripted at this point, i feel like i live in a fucking mirror funhouse. it’s like i can’t get him to give a fuck about me or be considerate towards me. i’ve tried reasoning with him, begging, being basically verbally abusive but he just doesn’t care. nothing changes. he says he loves me but it’s clear that he just likes that i take care of him like i’m his mommy. i’m disabled and in chronic so i can’t hold a real job. couldn’t finish uni because of it. i have crippling social anxiety. this means i’m at home all the time and all of the responsibility falls on me. all of his problems are mine to fix, and my problems fall to the wayside. my whole life people seem to think that putting a roof over my head should be enough. i feel like no one really sees me. i don’t have any friends, my life is so depressing that i’ve fallen out of touch with everyone, or people just stop talking to me because i never have anything positive to share and my life is going nowhere. i used to be a high achiever and now i have nothing. fuck, i don’t even have health insurance now so i can’t even afford my medication. i’m engaged so i could easily change that, but the thought of getting married feels like a nail in the coffin. at least where i am i can fantasize about running away somehow and starting over without having to get a divorce... of course, i couldn’t run very far anyway, without real work experience, a family, a safety net of any kind, or a body that lets me do manual labor.

Going to a psychiatrist for the first time to deal with depression,"I have suffered from depression on and off for a few years, but it's never been this bad. I am typically the social butterfly of my friends and no one would ever be able to tell I was depressed until recently.

"I relapsed into self-harm, please give me some upvotes, I'm sorry","I'm feeling very low, the new medication was working like a charm for the first 2 weeks IDK why, like the effect was immediate, and eventually the positive effects wore off and I was landed deeper into my depressed state. I was prescribed 20mg of Viibryd btw.  
I use to carry a stash of benzos in my backpack and my mother knows it. VERY VERY RECENTLY, I tried some tapentadol once and I liked it. NOW, my girlfriend is suffering from some lung infection that the doctor can't put his finger on, ultimately he prescribed her a Codeine syrup to lessen her cough, she pays around 15USD (800 Indian rupees) for prescription and the bottle costs like 120 INR (2 USD) for 100ML.....  
She has already been through 3 bottles, so, I being a good boyfriend, bought 30x 30mg codeine + 650mg APAP pills from my friendly pharmacy dealer beyond the counter. 

Now, I wasn't feeling well one night, very unwell, very very very unwell mentally. I took my benzos (like 3mg Klonopin-Clonazepam) and like 500mg Tapentadol if I remember correctly. If anyone of you knows, THESE ARE VERY HIGH DOSES, I have a huge tolerance for benzos but not for opioids, thankfully, Indian pharma is shitty quality, 500 was more like 300 IMO. 

Back to the topic, I took the pills, tried avoiding the mental and physical agony I was feeling while waiting for the pills to kick in after like, uhh, almost 2 hours, both pills were in full effect but I was still feeling very very very very very very very very very low both mentally and physically, I was just numb, couldn't slow my brain down enough to sleep or get into my senses. I tried youtube, Netflix, everything but nothing was diverting my mind. If I remember correctly, I popped 2 of those codeine pills (first time ever in my life).

I went to my kitchen, picked up the sharpest knife, went back to my room and starting cutting...... my arm. 16 cuts in total on my left forearm. I didn't tell my mom until I reluctantly showed her tomorrow morning after taking a bath. Her reaction? Oh good, you should cut your entire body. You should stop taking your meds if you are going to do this never the less. Shouted at me, didn't comfort me or feel sorry, just screamed at me. She bandaged me as if I was a street dog and not her son, violently, saying negative stuff about me all along, about how she handled my father for 25 years and she'd not think a single second before kicking this 'nuisance' out of her house, that she's not weak, she's strong and not weak, etc.   
Next day, I went to my room, opened my bag and took 2 codeine pills because the cuts were hurting, my dad saw me go into my room and he told my mom. My mom took all my pills and she asked me what these open pills are, I told her it's codeine and APAP that I got for my girlfriend. She counted the pills and said that there are above 20 pills here, how many does your girlfriend need? I said 8-9.  
She said I'll put that person in jail whoever the fuck is giving you these large amounts of banned medicines over the counter dot dot dot. I said that I asked the pharmacist for the medicine and he had 25, and he told me that nobody buys these anymore so it'd be better if you take 25 (I told her that he had 25 left) I took 2 for the pain and here we are at 23.

She didn't buy it, calls me a codeine addict, pills addict, can't handle my life, kinda grounded me but not exactly tbh.   
Earlier, I told her that in my 2nd year of college (currently I'm in 4th), I smoked weed, and after my panic attack in 3rd year, I can't smoke weed anymore, I don't enjoy drinking and I have tried a lot of other things with my roommate once for the sake of trying. I told her all this before all these cuts and the 'codeine addict' part... She made me flush all the pills into the toilet btw after the dad and pill incident.

I self-harmed again, fewer cuts but deeper, very deep tbh, almost needing stitches, she doesn't care, looked me straight into the eye and said "" so this is what you want, you want to emotional blackmail me? it won't work. I can see right through you. I'm going to call your girlfriend's parents and sue her for mentally torturing my son"".......  
wtf, my girlfriend doesn't do this, my mother is 50, yea, she's been through a lot and no one is listening to me in my family, not even my sister. I'm being treated as an outcast.  
After my second self-harm incident, I went out to my friendly pharmacist with one of my friends and bought some tramadol and APAP painkillers, they had 37.5mg tramadol and 300mg APAPand me weighing 220 lbs, I popped 4. My mother said no more painkillers for you, you won't even find paracetamol in this house anymore (she literally hid all the meds.....) and again called me a painkiller addict because she saw 4 tablets missing from the blister.

I did talk to her about her calling me an addict, I said that this is the first time and I've literally told you everything about my past drug use, etc, etc, at least you should believe me and trust me if you want, I'd stop taking any pills but stop calling me an addict because it hurts. This is the first time something like this has happened regarding me. No effect still continues with the taunts...

This is the first time something like this has happened regarding me. No effect still continues with the taunts...  
I'm hopeless, in mental and physical pain, I won't self-harm myself but the next step for me is literal suicide. I don't have anymore words to write. Thank you for reading."

School shut down for the COVID-19 outbreak and I’m scared I’ll become suicidal,"My university sent everyone home, I’m the only one of my friends who doesn’t live on campus and can’t go home.

There was already so much happening in my life that I had to deal with, and then this suddenly happens and just uproots everything. 
But the scariest part by far is that being alone will drive me to do things I wouldn’t do otherwise. I know myself, and usually when I’m alone for a couple days my depression gets really bad.

The year is 2015,"I sleep until 11:00, which at the time feels really late. I play video games for a short while, then hang out with friends and we play sports until it gets dark.

Fast forwards to age 16 in 2020. I sleep until 3:00 and I’m still tired. I only get up because my parents won’t let me sleep any more. My school is closed because of the coronavirus so I have to do all my schoolwork online. I put it off for no real reason.

Broken spirit,"I don't mean to sound like an edgy teenager but Idk how to describe it as ""spiritually dead"" is used for something else entirely.

I have hypothyroidism and it's ruining my life as I live in a bumblefuck town with idiots who can't and won't consider unconventional but effective ways to treat it. I likely have autism my dad knew about but didn't want to deal with it so just wanted me to try harder and not know why I struggled because my severely autistic brother has used up all my dad's non-existent patience for it. 

People hate me, and it's hard to blame them as I'm an ANGRY, miserable to be around, peice of shit fuck up. My exfriend and her bf played me, turned everyone against me and it's been made abundantly clear I'm literally a pariah. It's like this everywhere so it must be me.

I don't have friends, everyone just fucks with me. Everything I look forward to falls through. I have ZERO enjoyment and maximum stress and loneliness. 

I ONLY live because my stupid lizard brain is terrified of death and I don't want to abandon my cats but I don't think I can hang on to this pointless bullshit just to take care of cats. I have no motivation, no energy or hope that it gets better. I just want to die in my sleep completely unaware so I don't freak out.

Sobriety,"It’s weird how I view my sobriety, and how I have to handle my depression now without some sort of crutch. So recently I got a gift from my boss, it was a bottle of sparkling wine. It was a gift  for my help with the recent fundraiser for the non-profit organization I work at. I didn’t mention to them that I’ve been sober for almost 2 years. I was thankful and appreciative for the gift, in total honesty, and took it home and gave it to my parents. It’s weird how as time passes I forget how long it’s been since I had any alcohol. Before this I was on a 2-3 year binge of just drinking as much as I could. It didn’t matter what time if the day so long as I could mask my mental health problems I would do it. If it could shut the depression and anxiety up, I was up for it. I’ve felt weird when I’ve been with friends being the one that doesn’t drink, but I just can’t do that again. I still struggle to want to live now, like I did with drinking, it’s just a different struggle. My problems still exist as they did back then, I’m just not trying to destroy myself like I was. I tell myself that I can’t drink because I don’t want my family and friends to see that. Deep down I question if I lived alone would I just grab the bottle again.

"Need everyones opinion, a dating site, or a site/app intentionally focused on matching people with similar life views and also mental health conditions (handicaps per say) (more in description)","I often see, and for myself, people who have been depressed for many many decades. I am curious if there would be an interest in a dating/just meeting friends app that is specifically targeted towards people who are looking for people who may also be depressed, anxious, introverted, etc.

I know that if you’re introverted, maybe an extrovert partner can benefit you to push you outside your comfort zones. 

But also, some people are introverts, or depressed, or socially anxious, and aren’t really interested in putting any more time into being a social butterly, or going to bars/parties, so maybe finding someone who likes to also spend their free time indoors not with many people would skip the incompatibility of an extreme extrovert needing social contact and an extreme introvert who likes to spend their time alone or with close intimate relationships.

For example, it gets really tiring to be depressed, whether that is because of your world view (everything is meaningless, people suck, I dont want to work my life away in this capitalist society), or because genetics, upbringing, brain chemistry, financial status, social status, whatever! It gets tiring to be around or in a relationship with someone who doesn’t relate to the mental illness(es).

Has anyone had luck with medicine?,I want my energy back. I am tired of being too exhausted to even socialize or go to the grocery or gym. I have dragged myself into the gym before but It is just painful and I have no energy even when eating properly. My diet is pretty good and I get all the nutrients that I need and I consume a very small amount of added sugar and I only drink water. I need to be thinking about a career and I realized that my depression has killed my motivational mindset. I have tried therapy and at least 5 medications and nothing has worked they’ve only caused weight gain and killed all my emotions and made me into a robot.

Anyone with treatment resistent depression have this dilemma?,"You take medication and it does very little or it helps [i]briefly[/i]. You end up with phases of good and bad but often feel like you're getting nowhere. You feel total apathy and complete demotivation because of the medication you take so you wean yourself off of the meds after years of using them. When you've weaned yourself off of the poison, you have an incredibly short fuse, zero patience and absolutely everything makes you angry. The anger comes to a head sometimes and you immediately feel like dying because it's just easier - you don't die, you just carry on feeling like shit. Loved ones around you unfairly end up at the receiving end of your wrath.

Tried: a whole bunch of different types of antidepressant.

It doesn’t ever go away. I’ve just learned to live with it.,"I keep getting asked if I’m still depressed. Recently it was my dad, who was the primary reason for my depression. To make a long story short he’s an alcoholic, has been stabbed in front of me, was never really around, I’ve seen him beat my mom and almost kill her, grab her and dig his nails so far into her skin that she bleeds. He’s been to jail, rehab, the whole 9. I’m 22, in college and live by myself now. He reached out to apologize and I drove an hour to go visit. I get a call later that night when I get back to my apartment and it’s my dad telling me I looked sad and asking if I was still depressed. I replied with “It doesn’t ever go away. I can’t forget the things you’ve done; the things I saw. I’ve just learned to live with it.” 

I’ve noticed that when my depression is really bad or I have multiple bad things happen to me I begin disassociating but not for a moment more like weeks.

Severe nostalgia,"I wouldn't say I'm currently depressed, although I had my fair share of struggle against generalized anxiety and chronic depression.
However, since recently I've had this strange regret-kind-of feeling, I'm guessing it's nostalgia. But not the good kind. I can vividly remember that from around 8 to 15 years old (surely when I was even younger too), life was pure excitement.

The point is, I was alive, constantly interested in things and had feelings I can't describe.

I'm going to be 21 in a couple months and man I gotta say, life got really dull. I pay little to no attention to details of the world that surrounds me. I feel like routine is making my life monotonous. I can't recall the last time I had a dopamine rush (except when I gamble or have sex but that quickly goes away, don't ask why).

I don't know, I often have those horrible thoughts that life will remain that way and those exciting times will always be a thing of the past.

Well here is the deal I’m just going to write what I’m thinking and hope is going to make some kind of sense especially when I keep erasing my progress. So this going to be one of my post and a start to future post I hope. Because I’m just curious what other think of my situation witch is mostly me battling with depression from my early teens to now I’m 24(M).

This going to be testing waters because like I said I never done this before where I share my troubles and make past at list 6 year specially. I came aware of my depression when I left my parents house at 18 and stared working so I can pay rent and my living experience. I realized about a month in livening by my self that I’m hella depressed, I realized when I could not make my self go to the gym and start losing weight so I could go out and meet new people and make new friends and hopefully find a girlfriend. But unfortunately for me I did nothing but smoke weed and play games all day and go to work of course...

So I wanted to make a post of some kind for a wile now but my second guess myself always had stop me, and even now my inside are YELLING stop (you can’t tell anyone about your existence) but I want to change how I feel every second of the day.

Well here is the deal I’m just going to write what I’m thinking and hope is going to make some kind of sense especially when I keep erasing my progress. So this going to be one of my post and a start to future post I hope. Because I’m just curious what other think of my situation witch is mostly me battling with depression from my early teens to now I’m 24(M).

This going to be testing waters because like I said I never done this before where I share my troubles and make past at list 6 year specially. I came aware of my depression when I left my parents house at 18 and stared working so I can pay rent and my living experience. I realized about a month in livening by my self that I’m hella depressed, I realized when I could not make my self go to the gym and start losing weight so I could go out and meet new people and make new friends and hopefully find a girlfriend. But unfortunately for me I did nothing but smoke weed and play games all day and go to work of course...

I'm not sure why I try.,"I've been fighting since 2012 when I realized I was depressed, and i'm slowly not sure why anymore.  

People come and go in my life, they call themselves friends and then leave me behind. This has happened all my life, I don't know what I can do. I've tried being the life of the party, I've tried just staying away. Nothing is working. I thought I worked in a space where I fit in and belonged, and now I just find my self further and further on the outside of the group, slowly pushed away and back into isolation.

I discovered exercise ends depression almost always. By accident.,"In my 40s and been diagnosed and dealing with this for 3 decades now. Therapists, psychologists, Rx. Very serious trauma-the kind that freaks doctors out was/is part of it.

I accidentally stumbled into riding bicycles, then got really into it, then started jogging, then swimming. I cannot do the gym-I hate it. I have to be outside and so far I prefer being solo.

The further I run, ride, or swim the better I feel. The less I care about the past or future. The more I enjoy the present. My apt is cleaner. My taxes are in order. Everything I used to put off is done. 

I didn't know how bad, dangerous, cloudy, and self perpetuating my own thinking was until just recently. I was stuck in a cycle for years.

Now if I'm having a bad or depressed day I can just go run or bike. Had a brutal week recently. Rode a serious uphill mountain. Got home but mind was still not well at all. I ran 6 miles and was good to go. Even at mile 5 I had to pickup the pace because of what was bothering me-but I got so exhausted I didn't care anymore. 

I had massive anxiety about-I know this sounds funny but it's true-about dealing with government beauracies. Sailed thru the DMV like a cake walk last week.

I don't try to make friends or do anything social-ever. Tonight I walked into a room full of strangers-all triathletes-and kept up with them for and hour and half spin class. I would've never done that a year ago. The social aspect of going to an event and knowing not a single soul was a huge ""I'll pass"" for me for decades.

If I am having a personality conflict with someone at work I just exhaust myself before work and I'm too tired and have too many endorphins floating around to care.

A couple months ago I was riding long distance and this Frenchman rides up besides me and as we ride he explains how cycling saved his life. He explains to me what is happening to me now. He has ridden all over the place now-across continents. He was enjoying his day and I apologized for being lost in my thoughts-he replies ""That is why we cycle. It saved my f*©✓ing life!"" Hilarious-all in a thick French accent.

I am starting to really enjoy life for the first time in years. There are occasionally even amazing moments. It has gotten to the point when I don't feel like going to exercise I go anyway because it always works.

I didn't plan this and I didn't decide to do it. I went for a bike ride and enjoyed it. So I bought a used road bike because faster was more fun. I never tried to do anything besides a longer distance. Same w jogging. And swimming. I just said ok last time was half mile this time add a quarter mile. I'm down 20ish pounds so far. The opposite sex makes comments about it. 

I get along better with people who normally irritate me. I don't get as worked up about near as much. 

I wish I would've known this in my late 20s but I'm glad to know now.

After about 6 months I started surprising myself. One day I randomly rode 55 miles when planning on doing 20. One day I rode 3700ft up. I was struggling with jogging more than 10 minutes so I quit for two weeks and woke up and ran a 5k straight one morning. Within 3 weeks that had turned to 6 miles.

Help- Wellbutrin and speech/language problems?,"Hi guys. So, I’ve been noting since I got my dosage of buproprion XL to 300 that words in general are “farther away.”

I’m a writer and my vocabulary should be pretty darn large, but I struggle expressing myself vocally now. I feel I can barely string together a coherent sentence, and during conversations this makes me fumble and be unsure of what to say, or I say stupid stuff.

Wellbutrin is the only medication that seemed to do much of anything for me. But now this. I barely want to live anyway, so if my cognitive ability is going to get stuck in grade school, and my conversational skills are going to take a dive, why be on anything at all.

I’m on currently:
80mg Prozac
450mg XL bupropion (wellbutrin).

TL;DR: I’m thinking of going off all my meds right now. In response to this particular symptom. 

Can you all please give me advice of whether I should or not? If yes, can I stop taking all my meds tomorrow morning and not have long-lasting brain damage (obvi still going to go through withdrawals).

Please someone talk to me!,"I thought last year was the worst year of my life after losing my best friend and having no one to support me. I'm not gonna lie, it's turned me quite bitter. Well this year hasn't been any better and I feel like things are taking a toll. It all started when I had to move back with my ex because my old roommates werent responsible. This ex was cheating on me when my best friend died- cheated other times before. But makes me feel like hes still doing me a big favor by letting me live here. Well, about a month after living here I ended up getting punched in the face where my face was almost destroyed. (This was 3 and a half weeks ago) cops were involved. Nothing was done since I had no where else to go. I would go to a shelter if I didnt have to be separated from my dog, but idk how they work. Well, I cancelled plans for weeks because of how bad my face was and I didnt want anyone else to know since the cops didnt even help much. (It was the first time of him hitting me after knowing him for 2 and a half years, I was stunned. I havent been hit like that since I was a kid by my mom.) Well my birthday was the fifth of March, and my aunt died the same day. I went to a benefit to raise money for her burial, and my uncle I loved all my life ended up calling me hot and upset I changed my hair. (I went back to my natural.) It made me feel disgusting. He gave me the strangest hug there and it was so feely it made my stomach drop and feel empty. We were alone and I was so happy a stranger came out. He tried telling me my step dad had the hots for me too, when my step dad is literally my only family member I can trust. I havent spoken to anyone because I feel so betrayed and disgusted. I don't want to type detail because my mind is running a mile a minute. I don't know why he had to call me hot, not only once three times. Before it was just him and I, it was a whole bunch of older guys he's friends with saying the same thing. It makes me not like guys almost completely now. 

I found out people don't want to hang out with me because they don't know how to help or react to my issues and it hurts me. Its hurts me sooooo much. I've been alone since my best friend died, even my birthday,  and I can't handle all of this! I want the words that came out of my uncle's mouth gone. I don't even want to exist anymore. I came here because its anon and I need someone to give me advice or help me. I've been on so many meds they don't help. I just want someone older than me to actually mean and tell me  that things will be okay eventually. Because I cant take anymore! I'm a female that just turned 24. I feel so dumb because of my choices I'm just trying to survive. If my ex never kills me anyways since he suddenly wants to start hitting me now.  Please, can someone please talk to me? Any other women who have been to shelters, could you sleep with your dog and have them with you? My dog is my only comfort now and family. I can't go anywhere with out him.

It all just feels so pointless. I'm either depressed the entire day or anxious and in the rare occasion I feel neither its all just extremely dull.

I suppose I should be happy, I've got a few great friends. I'm graduating in a few months and my parents do their best. But meh I don't feel happy. At least not for long. I know last week was quite good, had a holiday so I didn't have to go to my internship so I could just stay at home and get some rest, do some of my hobbies and game for a bit. Friday and Saturday I went out with friends. It was great and especially seeing those friends again over the weekend really made that week but as soon as I got home Saturday evening the shitty feeling I had before the vacation came right back in its own new way and hasn't left me since.

It's just that as soon as I have to go work again it feels like I won't have time to do ""fun"" stuff again. Work's fine, apart from one guy who mocks me sometimes the people are nice and I enjoy it. If I can focus I won't be depressed but if not its going to be a long day where I can't get anything done but no matter what, as soon as I leave work at the end of the day I'll start feeling like absolute shit. I'll go home and know that I won't really have time for myself to really relax. I have like 2 hours before I should go to bed and it just feels like that's not much time to do anything. At the end of the week I'm exhausted so I don't really know what I should do in the weekends. Besides that I don't really know what interest me anymore, I'd like to pick up a hobby I can either do alone or with others but I don't have any interest besides programming and gaming. Sure some stuff related to programming but none of my friends really care about it.

Just knowing that if I don't fix my issues it will probably stay like this for a very very long time sucks. I think I know what my problems are yet I don't have a solution. I know that some of these vents sometimes help with getting my thoughts in order and relieve some stress but doing so on reddit is really hard and the other option is venting to a friend but that gets me so anxious.

It's just too much. I want to take it on one step at a time but I need like baby steps. I mea I feel like I do yet even getting out of bed without feeling like shit seems like taking one hell of a leap forward and every single day starts the same way and ends the same way and that shit feels so dull. Knowing the next long years will all look the same and probably get shittier with each year just make me want to give up.

Sometimes I feel like crying. Today I was at work and after some frustration I just felt like resting my head on my desk and just cry it out but ofcourse I can't do that.  Other times I just am not able to and I feel like its the only real way I can let out way too much bottled up emotions.

I don't really know how much of what I said makes any sense, sentence construction might also be a bit weird since its just a bit too hard to focus.",t2_3qzlvxl8,5,0,1,"I just wanna give up

Hangover,"what do you do 

when you feel like it is over ?

when all you feel is blue 

like it’s a bloody hangover 





when being out and about 

turns into pain 

when you feel like there’s no way out 

and you’ve got no one but yourself to blame
 



  
what do you do 

when your salad days are gone.

when all they can do

is force you to move on.




when the beauty of innocence and pure youth

gives its way mercilessly to the so-called truth.

when every nook and cranny of former bliss

turns into something you don’t even miss.


  

what do you do

when that whisky no longer helps.

when each and every part of you

when you feel like it is over ?

when all you feel is blue 

like it’s a bloody hangover 





when being out and about 

turns into pain 

when you feel like there’s no way out 

and you’ve got no one but yourself to blame
 



  
what do you do 

when your salad days are gone.

when all they can do

is force you to move on.




when the beauty of innocence and pure youth

gives its way mercilessly to the so-called truth.

when every nook and cranny of former bliss

turns into something you don’t even miss.


  

what do you do

when that whisky no longer helps.

when each and every part of you 

is on the verge of facing potential death.

Should I stay away from my friends while I try to recover ?,"Umm so this may sound wierd but should I stay away from my friends while I try to recover from my depression ?

just a rant,"this is just a rant to write down all of my emotions not super interesting 

today my school told me that i miss too much school and now im stuck. whenever im at school talking to someone its so easy to fake happy and smile but the minute im left alone i feel like im going to cry. once im left alone i feel like i deflate and all of my energy leaves. whenever my energy leaves i can barely walk around without a voice in my head telling me just go to sleep, just shut your eyes. 

I feel like i have a weight on my head thats dragging me to the floor. 

idk if anyone can relate but it feels like a heavy headache, my head doesn't hurt so its not an actual headache i guess but it feels like my head is hurting... and my chest just feels heavy but not as much as my head does. i feel like the voice in my head telling me to sleep is sabotaging me. 

I have a friend at school who i have opened up too a little, they know i just have a hard time and they used to try to talk to me. they used to ask me whats wrong and we would talk everyday and when i was tired i would just hang around them and stay quiet(cuz thats what i usually do when im not feeling well) but im not mad at them or anything and i try to make it clear. like i still want to talk and be a friend even though i feel heavy i still want to have a friend to talk to. but i feel like i have annoyed them by being so sad all the time. they say that im always welcome to hang out with them and it doesnt bother them that sometimes i stay quiet at lunch with all of our friends, but that was a while back and i feell ike things have changed, im losing my only friend because im just so miserable and i dont know what to do, 

i feel like with the people that dont know how miserable i feel its so easy to act normal and be happy and laugh but with people that know i feel like i cant act happy at all, its harder for some weird reason and i feel SO bad for being so miserable in front of them. i try not to express my feelings anymore when they ask because i feel like its not anyone elses problem but mine but i dont know if thats whats pushing them away because i just cant open up anymore. like when i hang out with them i try so hard to be happy and normal but they just dont reciprocate like they used to and when i see them to talking to someone else they are so excited and happy. they havent said that i annoy them but i feel like i do so now i just try to distance myself to make it easier because i dont want to annoy them but i cant tell if im pushing them away more because of this or helping them so i dont annoy them. im just confused. any advice? can anyone relate?",t2_5oue307u,1,0,1,"just a rant this is just a rant to write down all of my emotions not super interesting

I ruined my life plans two years ago and am still recovering.,"Two years ago I was “kicked out” of the Army because I got a DUI right after I returned from my deployment. I was 24. I joined when I was 18 (2012) and was loving it. Everyone got along with me. I felt like I belonged. I had goals, both short term and long. People would complain about the Army but I always looked at it as the best thing to happen to me. My father and both of my grandfathers served in the Army. My first duty station was in Germany when I was 18. I started partying and drinking a lot there. It was such a change of what I was used to. I got in a little trouble there. Moved on to a base near Seattle in 2015 and kept my partying habits. I was doing great with my military career, though. I was getting the highest scores on fitness tests and getting promoted rather quickly. Stayed out of trouble for the most part. Then I deployed to the Middle East in April 2017. Returned in January 2018. Nothing traumatic happened during my deployment. No combat engages or anything, but my drinking seemed to just get worse when I got back. I got a DUI three months after I returned to Seattle. Two months later, I was packing my bags headed back to the house. I got an honorable discharge and even get disability for my injuries sustained during my service, but that’s not the point. My whole life revolved around the military. It fit me. I could “play the game” as much as they wanted. I respected my superiors and they respected me. I had role models and I was a role model to others. I had a long list of things I wanted to do in the Army, spanned out over the next twenty years.

Since I have been out, I went to school for a few months using my GI Bill. Drinking was still a problem. I hated the jobs I had because it wasn’t the same as the military. People didn’t act the same. Everyone seemed much more selfish and I lost the feeling of esprit de corps (pride shared by members of a group). On top of that, I lost contact with most of my friends from the military. I felt like they looked at me different now. I felt ashamed. I can say I have a few that stuck with me till this day, but a lot just cut me off. I got out in July 2018. In March 2019 I used heroin for the first time. I have been addicted and have been burying myself in debt and a shit credit score since. (Long story short)

Last week I came clean and confessed to my friends and family that I had been addicted to heroin for the past year. Before that, no one knew about my addiction besides my drug dealer. I feel like that is the first positive step I have taken since I got that DUI. It seems like it’s been downhill these past two years, and I still miss being in the military terribly. I just hope I can find happiness elsewhere. I climb cell towers now and the guys are pretty cool. Some of them are veterans. I told them I had been using heroin as well and they are going to help me stay clean. I just hope things get better this year. I might even start going to church. I have been depressed for too long. 

This post turned out longer than I intended, and I am sorry for that. For anyone else going through something, I truly hope it gets better for you. Thank you for reading

Question on suicide,"Just wondering abt this qn for years: is it true that people who have attempted suicide, could have already been planning the action in their heads for months and even years?

I think about scenarios of myself jumping off a building, taking pills and no one will ever know I'm dead. Even right now, if I tried to kill myself and it succeeded, no one would know or care. The worst thing is when its not successful, I would end up handicapped and live with it for the rest of my life. So taking my own life becomes a huge gamble.

Can I ever stop hating myself?,"Is this something anyone can relate to? I don't feel like I'll ever get away from this deep self hatred. Maybe part of it is that i don't feel like I deserve to, and so i don't want to. I've felt this way literally for as long as i can remember, since i was little. I'm 27.

I have ok moments where i make plans and goals to pursue my passions. I'll feel creative and excited about the future for a while. But this always just seems to collapse into feeling like I'm just so sick of thinking about myself. Whatever i might create or accomplish is just all about me and the appeal vanishes.

At times I want to get out and really make the effort to make friends and start dating again. Then i realize i shouldn't be subjecting people to that. They won't like me, or eventually they won't.

Does therapy or medication genuinely help these feelings? I've never really had any diagnoses or treatment but it's difficult to find the motivation. It's not going to fix my flaws, it's not going to make me a likable person.",t2_1pzggp02,1,0,1,"Can I ever stop hating myself? Is this something anyone can relate to?

I need a distraction but I can't muster any interest in anything.,"I quit working last week because I'm pregnant and due at the end of this month.

I'm already bored out of my skull but I can't get excited for anything.

I've played a few of my go to video games but I lose interest or get way too frustrated way to easily. I can't find any new games that spark any excitement.

The internet, especially Reddit, is flooded with political discourse and only serves as a reminder that I'll be bringing my daughter into a world where the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, suffer, die, and the middle class lives in blissful ignorence with their heads firmly up their asses. The guilt I have over this is intense.

My husband tries so hard but there's nothing he can do. So he just kind of lingers waiting for me to come up with something, anything that he can do to help. Cue more guilt.

I know I need to get help but I'm in this awkward position where I've only managed to stay qualified for government health insurance because I'm pregnant. After my baby is born I likely will get kicked off again but I still won't be able to afford private insurance. Even the cheapest plans have deductables in the thousands that I'll never reach short of getting hit by a bus.

Even if I get help now, I'll likely lose my insurance in the next few months and have to quit any therapy or medications. Last time this happened and I had to quit my meds cold turkey I wanted to kill myself for 3 months straight before I balanced out to my normal level of depressed.

I just don't know what to do with myself except hope that this baby comes sooner than later and the drive to give her the best life possible will keep me going.

Edit: But wait there's more. As I'm laying here being miserable I remember more miserable things. Yesterday I actually mustered the energy to do some cleaning. I spent a good portion of my day cleaning my kitchen and dining room. I cleaned and organized cabinets to make room for baby stuff and scrubbed from top to bottom. Normally this would give me some sort of sense of accomplishment and a little boost. But this time, nothing. It killed some time at least.

I feel completely confused a lost,"I've been dealing with depression and PTSD since childhood. I recognize that I'm very sensitive to what situations I'm in and that it effects my mental health. I'm a strong willed person and no matter the cost, I'll always remove myself from whatever situation that's causing me more pain and trauma.

Whether I'd have to move, lose a job or lose a relationship- I'd put myself first because I knew my kids needed me to be strong.

About 2 years ago, something happened to me that really turned my whole world upside and made my depression and PTSD worse than anything that's ever triggered me before. It's hard to function. I invested the small amount of money that my husband left me when he passed (this isn't the incident I'm referring to) into moving to a town I never lived in before, for work. A couple months later, the small local company I was working for, closed down.

My bills all have disconnect notices and my rent is now going on 11 days late. I'm going thru a process to get a new job but it's in a secured building so there's lot of backgrounds checks and clearances etc, so it's taking forever. I'm just at a loss. I can't even buy myself feminine products. It's to the point were I'm emotionally unravelling more and more. I've applied everywhere else for a temporary job, McDonalds, stores, gas station, anything to keep me going. No one will hire me and believe me, I put on a happy face and am a completely friendly person. It's not like I walk in a depressed mess.

I'm so terrified that I'm gonna end up homeless when I'm so close to actually achieving something. I've been a complete insomniac for about 4 months. Sometimes, I don't sleep for days. I feel like I'm going in circles. I can't stand anything. I'm praying this job comes thru and that I can function. 

Does anyone understand what I'm saying? How do you pull thru this? I honestly can't take anymore. I barely shower or bother getting dressed. It's like, ""Why dirty the clothes when i have no money to wash them?"" ""Why waste the soap when i can't buy more?"".

My life feels meaningless,"I know this has been said a thousand times over. But I guess it just feels better to write my own post. 

I’m (20m) in 1st year of university. I’ve felt the lows of depression, but now I’m at a point where I almost feel nothing.  Nothing interests me. I used to love playing video games, going home and laughing with my family on weekends, watching Netflix. But now nothing feels worth doing. The only time I get excited is when it’s Friday and I can drink and maybe do a line of blow or 2 to actually give myself some happiness. I don’t have a drug problem or a drinking problem, but Friday and Saturday nights are the only time I actually feel excited....

It got worse when I met this girl, who actually made me excited to go out and do things. To just be with her made me happy and smile.  But to add even more shit to my already meaningless life she constantly gets super close to me, we kiss, sleep together, laugh together. and I’m so happy, but then she’ll push me away, hard. She’ll act as if I don’t matter and has zero disregard for me or how I feel... I’ll tell myself that I have to cut her off, but then she’ll come onto me and I just can’t resist.... This girls toxic, but thinking about how happy I am when I’m with her, and comparing it to every other thing in my life, just dulls everything even more.  

Every single day is another dull, grey, boring experience and the only thing that brings any relief is sleep.

Can't find a gf,"Hey fellow anonymous Reddit people.

I kind of need to just rant to someone and talk about how I truly feel since I have nobody I can tell this to in real life 

But the truth it I'm honestly depressed, I used to look down on people who say that. Like why are you depressed that sucks but get over it, etc. But now it's come around and kicked me in the ass. 

I'm really losing motivation in life, I'm getting pretty old I'm 30 now, I've only had 3 relationships in my life they all didn't last very long. And everyone I see now is married or has a bf/gf and it drives me insane.

My thoughts are the worst, 
- am I not good enough, 
- is it my skin color ? (Tan) it seems like all the girls I want only want white guys. 

And then on top of that I'm envious as hell
I can give you 1000 examples but I recently fell in love with (or at least have a huge crush on) a girl who is married. I can't help it she is perfect in my eyes. I see her 2-4 times a week and we hang out for a couple hours each time. Sometimes she tells me about her relationship issues. I just wanna tell her break up with that dude and be with me but I know that would ruin the friendship we have. Then the worst part is like right now 1 am I can't sleep , and just thinking we'll she's probably getting fucked right now. 

What makes me mad is when people try to give me advice, a friend just texted me like ""oh you have to just wait until someone comes to you"" or other people like ""God has the perfect girl for you in his plan"" or ""there are plenty of girls out there"" 

Well what the hell if all that is true I wouldn't be 30 and single when I'm not working or doing something I think about how every girl I've ever had a crush on is dating somebody else now in bed with somebody else getting fucked by someone elae, would they even care if I was gone.

I wanted Freedom,"When I was a kid my father ruled the family with an iron fist.

I wasn't allowed to go anywhere but school and maybe church. 

I had to beg to go anywhere else. I had to ask permission to go to the bathroom, eat, or watch TV.

If he let me go anywhere he would go with me. I had a couple friends in school but they weren't allowed to come over and I wasn't allowed to go see them 

I never went anywhere without him. NEVER 

He treated my mom the same. If she cleaned and missed a spot he would open the cabinets and take everything on the floor. She also had to beg for food.

When I was 5 he took all my toys and burned them in the backyard. I had a favorite uncle that had died a few months before.  He gave me a rainbow Brite doll that I cherished. He burned it too.

That was the night I told my mom I wanted to go to heaven and be away from him. I remember swallowing a bottle of asprin. But it only made me sick to my stomach 

He knocked up my babysitter and when my mom found out he hit my mom because she got mad.

I remember praying to God to either take me or my dad. I felt guilty for praying for my dad's death.

Smartphones and the internet are a direct contributor to mental health,"I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago.

Arguably, people seemed happier and more content without all this information being thrown at us from every angle. Ok, pre-internet days there wasn't enough awareness for certain things, the internet does have it's good points but i feel how much internet you use has a massive impact in your over-all mood especially with the amount of information we digest when we go online, our brains have to work twice as fast and twice as hard to process all this information.

I'm on a bit of a weight loss journey at the moment and i need a lot more positivity to keep me focused and people who have done internet detoxes before have said they felt there mood improved and were able to do more things without constantly wanting to go online.",t2_2s3zrr9x,6,0,1,"Smartphones and the internet are a direct contributor to mental health I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago.

How to deal with numbness causing for lack of creativity and joy?,"Naturally I'm a pretty creative and sensitive person. I love art and everything creative in life. Actually, when I'm feeling good I can get pretty spiritual. I always feel like wanting to make *something*. Unfortunately I suffer from a lot of mood switches and I feel numb quite a lot. So please understand me good, I'm not sad. But I'm not happy or joyful either. I'm just numb. 

This also has a **lot** of effect on my creativity, joy and obviously motivation. I don't get the good-good feelings from doing something I actually LOVE. For example I absolutely love music, listening and making music. But whenever I'm feeling numb or depressed, one of the first things I stop doing is anything related to music because it doesn't please me. And that bothers me quite a lot actually. I love my creative side but this depression thing kinda messes a lot with it..

IM BECOMING DANGEROUSLY DEPRESSED ABOUT MY HEIGHT.,"People who are taller have it easier in a lot of areas of life. Being an athlete, aesthetic purposes, ability to be the alpha male of a friend's group (weird one I know but still true) but the one that is the affecting me the most, is being in a relationship.

I'm just waiting for the moment when everyone else finally realizes how worthless I am.

\---

These are the things I whisper when I'm asleep. These are the thoughts that try to bury me in a protective shell. These are ingrained beliefs formed by experience. They make me want to curl up and isolate. To protect me from the despair I feel when I have to face the truth: nobody in the world loves me, so I must not be worth loving.

The typical reaction to that is doubt. No, your parents love(d) you. I hated hearing that growing up. When I went to live with the youth ministers from church, I was 15. They took me in because I had dropped my at-risk-youth hs/college program classes. This was due to my mother telling us that we were going to get evicted as she couldn't pay rent. She said this while she was on a 72hr pysch hold. She had been put there after she called the suicide hotline. The social workers came, it was dark out. She had been in her room sobbing uncontrollably. Lying on the floor (her bed really, we didn't have mattresses). She had stolen money from her job to go to the casino. Her plan was to win and replace the money before Monday, nobody at work ever knowing. Like most nights, she lost.

I began living with them in October/November. Fast forward to winter break. They ask me if I want to go home for Christmas. I say no. They say it's important to see my mom, she misses me. ""No, she doesn't"". You're just saying that, you need to go for her. Alright. I go. I see her for maybe five minutes over a week. Christmas passes, I go back. They ask why I'm back. I said I went till Christmas, saw her, mission accomplished. They drove me back. Got another five minutes, in passing over the final week of break. They didn't have to take me in, maybe they changed their minds and it was easier to pretend. For me, that said everything. It wasn't long before I was tired of their rules and decided to move back home, to help my mom out, because she loved me.

I now know better. I'm on the path to healing. To accepting myself, even when I fail. Failure is especially difficult because it feel like confirmation of all those thoughts. So I try to avoid it at all costs, but inevitably, I fail there too. I'm becoming OK with that. Learning how to accept and love myself, one moment at a time.

basically my mum just came out into the living room and asked relatively nicely why i didnt go to school is it my mind and stuff and like i really can’t answer cos i literally had a breakdown an hour ago and so i just kept silent and she kept insisting and then afterwards she kept not letting it go and i just said softly its ok just write a letter later and then she started raising her voice like why wont i talk or answer her and then i got really annoyed cos she WOULDNT stop. asking. 

and then i just told her that screaming and shouting isnt making me feel better and that i just dont want to talk and she kept asking is it the mind or fever or and like shouted back and then she basically blamed it on my lack of desire and will and said god cursed her with this and cursed me with this and blamed my attitude for everything and then she just kept screaming that god gave me this life and 
like basically she accused me of always being so nice and talking to my doctors and stuff and like how i promised that i would tell them stuff when i wasnt feeling good but now im not keeping my word but like when u see someone like that DO U REALLY HAVE SUCH LOW FUCKING EQ that you cant like give them space and time and just BACK OFF. why does everyone fucking assume that if depressed people dont talk about it, they’re repressing shit? ITS NOT SO SIMPLE.

I talk. When I want to. When I’m comfortable. and if you dont fucking make me feel comfortable then DO U THINK I WILL TALK. and being comfortable is more than just being nice or like asking gently. it’s just knowing how to talk about it. AND YEA. LIKE LEAVE ME ALONE. STOP ASKING. STOP HARPING ON IT. and stop blaming me for using my phone because its one of the few things that keeping me from fucking jumping ok. 

and stop assuming i make the choice or that i have no willpower. i’m saying this now cos im angry so i can still believe for now but ITS NOT A CASE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED ARE WEAK. would u call someone who’s suffering through cancer weak? YOU THINK ITS TRUE? YOU THINK IT HELPS? and what more for someone whos struggling with a MENTAL disorder. just back off. AND ACTUALLY GO READ UP. ON HOW. TO HELP. and for once stop reading the bible because thats a book for your religious life not for how to help your depressed teen. and stop saying snap out of it, try harder. its literally the worst thing u can say right now.

im not religious and she knows that and the therapist even told her don’t talk about religion with me but all she can do is scream at me and say that god says if i think i will live i will live but if i think i will die i will die and that im basically not doing enough. even though ive opened up to my therapist, my friends and my doctor",t2_1lp297ei,1,0,1,"my mum expects me to talk this is just a rant but i know im gonna blame myself later

Hopelessness,"As the school I love announces they’re canceling classes for 2 weeks I now realize that there is no hope and that life is not worth living. I was brought into this world without wanting to be. I grew up with a brother that hated me, a sister with bipolar disorder, and a dad that has an anti social personality disorder.

Should I go to group therapy tomorrow? I’m terrified?,"
I’m 19. 

I started going to therapy last month because I thought I was bipolar. I see my therapist once a week. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder and social anxiety and seasonal depression. Not on any medication. There is a DBT group therapy of 6 girls (19-22 years old) that started at the end of February. The first meet was the 26th and then last Wednesday. With another therapist who I’ve never met. I didn’t show up at the last two (they didn’t put me on the list though so it didn’t matter but this week they did).

I currently don’t have a job or any friends (haven’t had friends or a job in months, can’t keep either). And i sit in my house most of the time or take my dogs for walks sometimes (but that causes anxiety if it’s crowded on the walking trail).

I am supposed to see my therapist Thursday and group is tomorrow and I got a group text message as confirmation that group is tomorrow and there’s other girls replying. I never said anything. Someone is bringing their cat and snacks for the group.

I’m scared there might be people I went to school with there at group (I was bullied a lot and virtually had no friends all 4 years and sat alone at lunch a lot, I have RBF so I guess that doesn’t help and a strong fight or flight response and tend to come off rude when I feel uncomfortable and I shut down). There is someone in the group named Rachel and I knew 3 Rachel’s that went to that school that absolutely hated my guts for no reason and made my life hell.  Idk if it’s her because I don’t know the last name. 

I’m also scared they are going to judge me (you know the looks on peoples faces to know they are judging you, that certain look and then the way they look at others after looking at you or if they start whispering) and won’t like me for whatever reason.

I’m having massive anxiety thinking about it, my therapist thinks it would be good for me to try it out so we can use some of what they teach me there in our 1 on 1 sessions and so I can potential try to make friends. She also told me about meet me.com meet ups and I’m too scared to do that, I don’t trust people and I hate driving. Driving gives me massive anxiety.

Hell going to the grocery store is a complete nightmare which is why my parents go most of the time for me. I always feel like people hate me.",t2_3ciycb9m,2,0,1,"Should I go to group therapy tomorrow? I’m terrified?

I feel like a side supporting character in everyone else's story.,"I have tried to hard to ""create my own story"" and every time it has failed, setback after setback after setback, inevitably I will try again, but I will always be overshadowed by people's success.

I hate not being remarkable, I hate having nothing to show, I feel useless in this world, all I ever wanted to do was make people happy (sounds like a horribly cliche Joker comparison, but there is no anger, just despondency and being jaded at life)

I still hold out on the hope that it will ""be my time"" and I will make something of a mark on the world.

I feel like I have been molded into someone who is destined to fail by people who wanted their own success.

I don't have a relationship, or a child, or my own home, my family and friends are always so busy.

Even jealousy doesn't factor in anymore, it's just the feeling of belonging is lost on me, and nobody seems to take my loneliness seriously...calling it boredom.

Meeting my dad and my paternal grandparents for the first time.,"I am currently 20 years old and I have lived my entire life being raised by my mom and her family. For a long time I had no interest in seeing my dad but that changed last year when I found a letter from my grandma addressed to my mom from 2002! Since I was a kid my mom told me that my dad and his family didn't want anything to do with us because my dads side of the family said she was having an affair with her boss. The letter kinda shook me because I felt lied too by my family because it proved they did want to meet me. Things escalated when I took an ancestry DNA test seeing that I matched with one of my aunts on my dads side of the family and actually got a message from a second cousin on that side of the family and things have been escalating since and now I am talking with my first cousin who is trying to get me to go to the Easter dinner, but I don't know if I want to go or what I would even say to them.

Not having a dad in my life is something I always felt self conscious about and it was a source of a lot of my depression when I was younger. It turns out he lived in the same town me and mom lived in until I was 12! My mom was also sick for close to six years and he wasn't around for that and never made an attempt to reach out to me or my mom.  I can't go into all the details of this last year and some of the things my mom told me but right now I am feeling a mixture of joy, fear, anger, excitement, but mostly a deep sense of sadness. I am worried my dads side of the family won't like me and I was thinking I should just meet my grandparents cause I've learned my grandfather has stage 4 cancer and I want to at least meet him before he dies.

How do I tell my parents I’m struggling again?,"So, I went through a depressive/anxious episode in high school, during which I went on medication and attended therapy and eventually felt better. Now, I’m in my 4th year of college, and I’m starting to feel the same way, only now, I have the freedom to not go to class if I don’t feel well enough to attend. It has gotten to the point to where I am most likely going to fail all of my classes, and I’m too afraid of judgement to tell anyone I’m struggling. I feel like my parents think my depression/anxiety was a phase that I got over, so I’m too nervous/embarrassed to tell them that I’m struggling again, because I don’t want them to tell me that I’m just lazy or incompetent or that I have the tools to get me out of this hole. I also don’t have the money to attend therapy without my parents paying for it. Basically, how do I tell my parents I’m struggling with depression/anxiety again without them thinking that I’m just lazy or experiencing senioritis?

What do you do to keep yourself going?,"For the past few years it’s always been hard for me to get motivated to do.. well pretty much anything. Recently though it’s got a lot worse.

*How do you keep yourself motivated* ?

Something to keep in mind if you’re going to answer is that a couple things are really holding me back. 

1. I don’t have any passions. I’ve tried really hard to find some, but nothing seems to catch my attention.

2. I don’t have any religious faiths. I know for a lot of people religion helps, but I just can’t do it.

On the verge of despair.,"Hi everyone! Thanks for reading.

I have been battling depression my whole life, but lately it's been harder than usual.
I was on the verge of suicide about 2 weeks ago, even though I'd vowed never to do it (I have a child). But I felt so low and hopeless. I feel unloved, under appreciated, taken for granted. I feel stupid (as in intellectually inferior), and I am starting to doubt my ability to make reasonable decisions.

I was a smart kid, school was always easy and I alway had good grades. I was always interested in psychology and philosophy, but I also had a passion for the Arts (film, photography and painting). I chose the arts route and have a degree in Fine Arts. Best years of my life for sure, but that didn't put me on the path of a good paying job! I was delusional, thinking I'd somehow make it as an artist.

I have no self-esteem, no confidence as an artist, so that never took off. I'm 38 now and all the jobs I've had are in office administration. A year ago, I got my license in real estate and started working for a realtor as his executive assistant. Within 3 months he promoted me to associate realtor, meaning I get to show clients properties and write up contracts. However, I've made a lot of mistakes (which is normal), and I've lost 4 clients in the last 2 months, one of which just tonight, so I'm really starting to feel as though I'm not very good with people. 3 of those clients were leads I was trying to convert, I'd only exchanged a few emails after meeting them at open houses. I like to joke that they ""Broke up"" with me, or told me they were ""seeing other people"". But the one client I lost tonight was someone I'd built a relationship with. I'd shown her and her husband multiple properties and I felt as though we'd ""clicked"". Sadly her husband passed away 4 months ago and she's now realized she doesn't want to move to my city anymore (completely understandable). It's a shame because I was really looking forward to seeing her again, and to find her a home here. Also, I don't have many leads and I thought this one was solid. 
I know this one is not personal, but the other 3 said they decided to work with someone else, so that hurts.

I'm starting to wonder if it's because my energy is low that I'm repelling people? My boss hired me because he felt I attracted people, not the opposite, and it did work for 2019. 

I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose my job or quit. I don't feel capable of anything else. I don't want to go back to office work. I want to be an artist, but I am so hard on myself, I always think my art is mediocre at best.

I left my country and moved 6,000 miles, 7 years ago, to marry a man I fell in love with, we have a child together and own our house. Yet I feel utterly dissatisfied with my life. I feel useless. I miss my friends and family, I'm isolated. What a stupid idea it was to leave them!

My miserable life,"Hello,

I've been here for a couple days and finally decided to tell how bad and sad is my life.

First of all im french so sorry my writing is bad and i don't want to waste anyone time so don't force yourself to read my story.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything began when i was still in elementary school , i used to have anger problems when i was a kid, especially in school, i wasn't hurting anyone or anything like that but i used to be really mad about small things, at that time people in my school used to bully me and make fun of those anger problems and my look, i was still a kid this was a huge impact for me, everytime i go back to my house i used to cry and the only thing i wanted is to change school, sadly it did not happen but it got worst, i used to be kinda depressed at that time and i remenber trying to tell my parents and my sisters (i have 2 sisters who are older than me) but nothing, they all rejected me and didn't help at all, they we're just screaming at me or didn't care.

Years after i finally was in middle school, i changed quite a bit since my anger problems started to stop which made me happy because i thought that people would stop making fun of me cuz of it, but i was wrong actually it was worst, i was still getting bullied and even worse people started to beat me up for absolutely no reason, i was 12 years old at that time and i was thinking about suicide a lot, but after days of thinking i knew it wasn't the best idea to suicide, i was always alone most of the time or with some buddies that didn't really cared about me, those years we're rough but i managed to go into high school !

Before going in high school when it was summer, i was always crying before sleeping, i really didn't want people to bully me again. You aleardy know that i was wrong...

So yeah, first day in high school was pretty much normal, after a few days people never spoke to me and i didn't, im really shy for a guy, 1 or 2 months later when we started to know each others it started to be bad for me, i forgot to say that earlier but when i was 12 i also started to have a deep voice which occured people to make fun of it, that's what they were doing and of course they also started to beat me up, everyday its like that and i feel like this won't stop.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my daily life in school, being a victim in front of everyone :/

Even when im home nothing good happens my parents always argue, and when i say always im not lying, basically every day they start to argue for dumb reasons, and i can't do anything about it, i aleardy tried but nothing happened.

I don't really do things in my life, im always bored and enjoy talking to people but people don't seems to enjoy me a lot, i aleardy helped some people in depression too but they never helped me too which made me think that im really nothing in this planet, i aleardy told my story to some people but some of them trashtalk me, i guess they don't like depressed people much :/

Other people don't care or they know how i feel but they rather use their time to talk with other people which i understand.

I'm still young i'm 17 and soon 18 but i just want to die quick, i'm not gonna commit suicide or anything but i'm just waiting for my time to come, i only listen to sad music everyday and do nothing just watching life through my window hoping someone talks to me, but no it never happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate my life, i hate violence and i hate using bad words, im sensitive for most of the people, i don't fight back im just a victim who does nothing and who is worthless, no one wants to help me the only thing that i can do is listen to music, cry and help other people instead of helping myself.

And that's basically it.

Sorry if it was long, sorry if i annoyed you, sorry if i'm a bad person, i think i don't deserve any love from anyone but myself, but even me cannot love myself, i just want to make people laugh, im smilling but deep inside is just tears and tears dropping down, im not attractive which i don't really care, i don't judge people from their looks, i'm just waiting...

waiting until i finally die and leave this world that doesn't want me.",t2_4u7s9mvo,3,0,1,"My miserable life Hello,

I'm still young i'm 17 and soon 18 but i just want to die quick, i'm not gonna commit suicide or anything but i'm just waiting for my time to come, i only listen to sad music everyday and do nothing just watching life through my window hoping someone talks to me, but no it never happens.

&amp;#x200B;

I just hate my life, i hate violence and i hate using bad words, im sensitive for most of the people, i don't fight back im just a victim who does nothing and who is worthless, no one wants to help me the only thing that i can do is listen to music, cry and help other people instead of helping myself.

And that's basically it.

Sorry if it was long, sorry if i annoyed you, sorry if i'm a bad person, i think i don't deserve any love from anyone but myself, but even me cannot love myself, i just want to make people laugh, im smilling but deep inside is just tears and tears dropping down, im not attractive which i don't really care, i don't judge people from their looks, i'm just waiting...

waiting until i finally die and leave this world that doesn't want me."

where do I start? about me?

I’m 20 years old, my birthday is in 2 days. I live with my girlfriend, but she pretty much hates me (at least it seems that way). I never met my dad, and the one side of family I *do* have doesn’t talk to me. I’ve been on my own since high school because my mom always treated me like shit and I couldn’t handle it anymore so I left. 

I don’t really know why I’m still here.

For the past year or so, my life has seemed to just kind of happen. I constantly feel like I’m a passenger in my own body while I watch everything around me go by. I feel like shit about it, but I don’t even have the energy or motivation to try to change it. I don’t know how. I don’t even know why it started. Was there a specific time when it did? Maybe it’s always been this way and I only became aware of it in the last year. I don’t know. It’s getting to the point where I don’t want to be alive.

Why? Let me walk you through every day in my life. 

I wake up at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon after a combination of shitty sleep, bad dreams, and staying up too late. I lay in bed for another hour or so and stare at the wall and contemplate whether or not I should eat. Eventually I get up to pee and eat cereal. When I open the door to the bedroom, my girlfriend (sleeps in the living room) is usually mad about something and wants to take it out on me, so I deal with that for the next half hour. After I finally eat, I wind up back in bed on my laptop scrolling through the endless amounts of people who I can potentially work for on facebook or reddit (I do “freelance” design/ music because I’m not good at anything else). By about 7 to 9 I’ve found a way to make like 50 bucks or so for the day, and then I lay here, in bed, where I am right now, and think about how much I hate this. I think about going places and doing things that could entertain/ excite me, but then I remember I can’t afford it. “Oh, well I’ll just get a real job so I can have money for those things.” But then I realize I don’t have a car and nobody would give me a ride anyway - not because people aren’t nice enough to do that, I just don’t have any friends.  

So then, after a few hours of that, it’s about midnight or so, and I figure maybe watching some YouTube or looking at memes can take my mind off of things. And I’ll admit, it does, but it’s only temporary. Everything is temporary. Everything but the constant looming cloud in the back of my mind that reminds me that my entire life is probably going to be spent like this, and as far as I know, there’s nothing I can do about that. 

Every day in recent memory has been a repeat of the day before and I can’t break the cycle. I don’t know how. I feel helpless. I know it sounds like I feel bad for myself, but I really don’t. I feel like this is all I’ll ever have, and as much as that sucks, I guess I’ve accepted it. I figure if I’m 20 now, and life has sucked for the last 2 years, and the average life expectancy is 80, I’ll only have to do this all like 30 more times before I go out from natural causes. Either that or I can take care of it myself and save the time/ trouble. I bought a gun, I’m just too scared to do it right now because when I was 6, my mom’s girlfriend did the same thing. So there’s that keeping me from doing it, and there’s a small part of me doesn’t want it to be this way. I just don’t know how to get out.

By the way if you don’t want to read all that, long story short: I have no money, I have no car, my girlfriend hates me, my family hates me, I have no friends, and every day of my life sucks. I have no motivation and no energy. I don’t even know where that stuff is supposed to come from anymore.

I don’t know what happened to me. I used to have dreams and aspirations but they died out over time and now I have nothing to look forward to. Since I was little I always wanted to be a big and famous musician, which, I know, is a stupid expectation. But it was always what I wanted to do in life. So I started playing guitar and singing when I was 8, and I was sure that was going to be my way of life. Slowly, when I grew up, I realized how unrealistic and dumb that was, but at that point, it was too late. I was about 18 when that hit me. 

Maybe that’s when it all started - when I was little. I mean, I had no role models in my family/ life in general, so the only places I found inspiration from then were the artists I looked up to. I mean, that lifestyle seemed so much more appealing than being a middle-aged single parent who didn’t want the kid in the first place (mom), a 70 year old alcoholic who is still bitter over a wife that left half my life ago (grandpa), or a 65 year old pillhead who makes money by lying to the government and getting disability checks to fund my pill addiction more (grandma).

&amp;#x200B;

I know this all seems like I’m finding everyone else but myself to blame for this, and maybe that *is* what I’m doing, but I literally have no other idea what it could be. My dreams died out before I could even reach them and now I’m just stuck. I’m stuck here. In this house. In this relationship. On this computer. On this planet.

"Frustrated by the phrase ""happiness is a choice""","I don't subscribe to the idea that anyone who has truly suffered a depressive episode actually believes that happiness is a choice. The implication of that phrase is that victims are *choosing to suffer*. It's victim blaming at its very core. We can't choose our thoughts any more than we can choose the weather. Happiness is a not a switch that can be flipped at will, but every time I hear ""happiness is a choice"", I only start to think that something must be wrong with me because I can't find the switch.

Ignore this post.,Nothing makes me feel better than being productive. Whether it be creating or working or just doing menial tasks it gives the moment meaning. At night all of that goes away. After about 10 o’clock I’m bombarded with difficult thoughts I’m forced to process. Life is unfair and I’m forced into this cycle of living for life. It’s impossible to just exist. I have to force myself to want to. These thoughts are cause for insomnia and most of the time I have trouble sleeping. When I’m intoxicated it easier. All I want to be is subdued. I don’t want to process what life actually is I just want to enjoy it. I get into this habit where I’m drinking/smoking myself to sleep which is honestly fantastic. The only thing that makes life worth living is when I forget that I’m living. I’d rather live in a cartoon or book where there’s a happy ending. I’m so desperate for someone to care. I hate being the “depressed” person so I never share it but honestly I’m lonely. So lonely. I’m tearing up as I write this. I feel like having someone would be the strongest drug I can get. I want it. I just want to live for my partner or something. I don’t know. I don’t want to die and I’m glad I was born but why does life have to be so cruel.,t2_5wgwgvsp,0,0,1,Ignore this post.

How do you remain functional?,"I am beyond depressed to the point that all my emotions have shut off and I’m on an auto pilot. But I can’t function.

Cancun,"I booked a trip to mexico with some friends out of peer pressure. I wondered if it was worth the gamble of me being either really miserable or enjoying myself.

"Just ruined a friendship, no fire to keep building my business, I get up and do stuff but it feels pointless, idk maybe someone can spark something to help.","Hey guys/gals. I have been having a rough couple months. At this point I have started taking the steps I know I need to do just to try to work on this. I am going to be going to bed at 10/10 30 every night, wake up at 6, work put/eat till 7 and then get ready and be in my office by 8. I am giving up video games till at least the end of the month and trying to do more social events all to try to break this cycle. But at the same time I feel like I am just going through the motions because it's what I need to do to build my business and hit my goals, but I don't have any drive, any passion, or really any feeling (other than occassionally feeling motivated or at peace) other than sadness, anger and loneliness and it feels like I am just going through the motions.

I ended a 2 year relationship in october because I didn't see myself being with her down the road. Then I started dating my boss in November and after 2.5 months we separated. Around this time I really started to notice my depression was kicking in and we were still trying to be friends. it was killing me seeing her every day and my mind was making my emotions go haywire and today the straw broke the camel's back and she said she couldn't handle it anymore and we can't be friends she can only be my manager.

The past few months I have been building my financial advisor practice yet have been working without a paycheck. Luckily my parents just offered to support my Bill's the next couple months because I have some clients coming in and things are moving forward slowly but surely so finances aren't a huge issue. But at the same time I am always beating myself up for not being perfect, I am being super negative and critical of myself and even though I love what I do for people, love the meeting with clients part and how financially rewarding this can be, it's a grind that I need to get up and fight to see people every day and I sometimes just don't have the energy.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no one I can lean on because I am always just too much of a burden, I feel like I'm just on a time till I get to the point I can't prove myself anymore, but I also can't go back to a 9-5 boring ass job that won't allow me the same financial freedom and work life balance this one can provide.

Idk, my hope with posting this is something will be said that might spark something for me to just give me the strength to push on. But that's my rant for the day.

How do you start treating depression?,"I have never been officially diagnosed with depression but it's very obvious. I want to change it because I haven't had a healthy relationship in years.

Help,"I have been completely normal and high functioning my whole life, no past history of abuse, struggle, or mental illness in me or my family. A little over a month ago, I realized I was sweating profusely, and my sex drive was gone (very uncommon for me). It got worse when, at school, I could feel my heart pounding through my chest. I went to the nurse and my blood pressure had skyrocketed(160/80), yet my heart rate was very low (41 bpm). My BP is concerning because I play sports and exercise often, and eat a healthy diet.

Coronavirus screwed literally all of my plans this summer/year,"Granted, not many were super huge plans, but it was something. Better than last year when I had no plans at all and stayed in my room all day. Take small steps, right? Well, I'm a baby learning how to walk. I take two steps forward, and a hurricane comes and yeets me back a hundred yards. 

My state declared an emergency today after we got five new cases yesterday. Schools have panicked and cancelled all field trips for everyone in the county, so I'm pissed off about that. My summer internship I applied for is likely to get cancelled because it's through the school, and my internship starting in August will probably be cancelled too. The cruise ship, while not cancelled, my family has decided not to go. According to my father, we're no longer going to travel anywhere for my 16th birthday this September. I just started a babysitting business and if the virus spreads too much by the summer I won't be able to babysit (which is the only way I make money + I really like it). My CCP will probably be online (which I HATE online school work). We're probably not going to the beach this summer (not that we ever do, but I was excited to ask my parents this year). And that's just the things that I can name off the top of my head. If I think long and hard I betcha I can come up with a ton more. 

This virus is she stupidest thing ever. Literally the worst possible thing for a person with depression who's actually trying to make themselves feel better for once. I was so excited to get out and do something other than video games this year/summer, and THIS happens. 

Knowing my fucking luck, as soon as summer break starts, the entire state will go on a quarantine lockdown so I can't even ride my bike outside any more. JUST as things were starting to get warm.

Tw: Child Abuse,"I'm only 17 and every day of my life for as long as I can remember, all I hear on the tv is about rape and kidnappings and child abuse and sexual assault. I cant stop thinking about it. It makes me sick to see a child or to be touched by a child because all I can imagine is them but in.. one of those situations.

Am I allowed to be depressed?,"I feel as though I have no right to be depressed. I come from a well off family, though with a lot of issues in it. I do have major health issues since I was born, but I have come to terms with that, for the most part. I graduated from a good university, and have great friends. I should have nothing to complain about, but I constantly feel pointless. Like nothing means anything. I feel empty and I just do not want to do anything. If everything just stopped tomorrow, I would be okay with it. I feel though I have no right to feel or think this way.

I've been feeling so depressed lately and I can't find the time or space to heal,"I've (21 M) been depressed for a while now. If I were asked where I thought it would stem from I'd say its my childhood &amp; family.

I grew up in a pretty well off family, enough money for needs to be taken care of. But that's it. Growing up, I didn't really speak to my parents. I was practically raised by my grandparents up until my grandma died (father side). Then everything took a turn for the worst. I had to go back and live with my parents. My dad is abusive both physically and emotionally, my mom is the type to throw people under the bus to save herself from my dad. My mom got into trouble a lot because of the stupid things she'd do for fun. Example: my mom would go to the mall, if my dad found out he'd start screaming. My mom would then pin the blame on me by saying I wanted food from somewhere so she went to get it (i didn't ask for anything, I don't even talk to my parents) then my dad would direct his anger to me and Id get punished for it. (punishments ranged from getting the belt on the mouth all the way to walking to some place nude, they could get pretty inhumane and they get worse). My brothers and sisters are the type to hide even when they know that what i was being accused of wasn't true. In our family, no one defended each other. and shit gets worse. When I was grade 6 I was stopped being provided with money for food and clothes (but my siblings still got) so I had to work. at one point they stopped providing for my education (while they were funding my siblings and bought a ticket to fly out except me) so I had to fund myself. 

Apart from family, my social life was a little better but enough trauma to fuck me up. I was a relatively fat kid who was often bullied in school. I'm not that bright, nor am I physically gifted. I had a a few neighbors I was close to though, so that brought me a lot of comfort knowing I'd still be fine since I have a few friends I could turn to.  FF to our adolescent years 3/8 people in our circle of friends died by suicide. And that hit all of us hard to the point where we don't know where each other is or what they're doing anymore. Just heard recently one of them died by suicide too so that makes it 4/8

My granddad became my scapegoat. He'd help me escape from my family. I would just stay in his room and talk with him and maybe play chess while he keeps me company as late as he can keep me before he lets my parents take me home. however upon entering college he got a stroke so I don't have that safety anymore.

I tried running away. I tried buying my own apartment. They intervened with the contractors, companies, and persons and stopped them. I tried buying a one way ticket to some other country. They had airline connections and stopped me from being able to board and had my passport cancelled. I tried going to a forest so that I cant be found. They asked the local government help to track me down and had a search team look for me. When i get home, same thing. I'd get beaten &amp; abused ( I have marks all over my body that I always cover up so that people wouldn't see). No treatment change whatsoever. 

I'm in 5th year college now  ( 4 year course but had to slow it down to make time to earn money) and I'm still pretty much going through hell. I have to deal with my parents abuse at home, I have to work to pay tuition (sometimes my brothers' too) and rent (my own parents is making me pay rent for the house they bought and live in) bills and my grandfathers medical bills (my dad refuses to pay his share and ended up making me pay for it). And the current hell I'm living in, I see no end in sight. I keep trying to get some space to heal but I can't get that space or time because when I think I have the space and chance to, something mad happens.

I'm pretty much in the shits right now and don't know what to do. I've contemplated suicide several times already and it's becoming more and more a very appealing option as time passes. The past 2 attempts I had, a guard found me and stopped me forcefully.

My question now is, what makes life so great that its worth living until the end? Because as things stand, I don't see anything worth staying longer for.

Lonely. Unwanted man,"So throughoit the last few years i've started to feel more lonely, more depressed, sometimes even suicidal. I'd say that last 2years have been the toughest. So i've had friends all my life. Some have come and some have left. Few have stayed, but 2years ago i was having the best time of my life. During the summer i got really close with a girl. I hadnt had a relationship before that and unfortunately it didnt become my first one either. I was hanging out with alot. We went shopping, out to have a dinner etc. The way she was acting made me feel like we have something although she had said sometime before that she would never have a relationship with me. But when the summer ended she got a boyfriend and disappeared for me. I tried contacting her through messenger but the answers were short and meaningless. So i was like okey, thats wierd. I thought that maybe after some time she will start chatting again but no. During that time a lot of my friends were getting into relationships and i was the odd one out. No matter what i tried i would never get a girl to like me more than a friend. And believe me i tried many times. I workout, i go out(although many times i feel very lonely), i drink reasonably, i have a stable income, im really friendly, im told i have a big heart and its in the right place, i underatand humour of every caliber. But it seems that im just ugly, or not rich enough, that im a virgin, that i dont have experience. Every girl that i have been interested in hasnt shown any interest in me. The way that they talk to me is so much different to my friends, alot different. Every one of my friends, parents, grandparents just keeps asking where is your girlfriend, and saying that time is ticking(im 22). I understand their concerns beacause im concerned about it aswell. Funny thing about it all is that every close friend that is in a relationship is thanks to me. I brought them together with they girlfriends. Now they go on doubledates and im basically left to be alone. They have invited me and i have joined(thirdwheeling) them but everytime it has been very awkward for me and very depressing and lonely. And it seems that im destined to be alone, destined to help other and its eating me from inside, it has become unbearable to the point that i have been feeling suicidal.

I'm gonna die soon... but I do not want to.,"Hello everyone,

I finda kinda weird to explain my personal history, but I do not know what the fuck to do.

I was born in a normal family. Not rich, not poor. An overprotective mother made me kinda insecure about things. I always have been little, yet really agressive as a child, plus having a huge self demand on myself.

I live in a hard country to grow up. I was bullied all my entire life. When I was 12, I was bullied or ridiculized by everyone in my class. They put spiders on my desk (I am afraid of them), they kick the shit outta of me, they throw away my food always.

I was the ""bullied smart guy"" of the class, but I get sick of it; in my teenage years I started to ""try to be"" the cool kid that goes with the ""cool guys"", but I ended being a weird sidekick, that still was bullied by a lot of people. Nothing weird though. Not responded love on my teenage years, and shit like this.

But I slowly started to develop a depression. I think in my 15-16 I started to feel weird. You know, shit like that. Not like ""ugh, life is sad, I feel depressed"", just a bad chemical reaction on my brain. Thing was going shitty, but I could take it.

Then, everything was going downhill (like at 17-19). I was pretty OK in martial arts (I was stopped being bullied too, lol), but I suffered a lot of injuries; I had to stop. I had my first girlfriend... yet, she commited suicide. I started university, yet all my friends only were one course with me. Some of my best friends just dissapeared of my life from one year to the other; others, just fall in ""bad life"" (drugs, problems).

Then, at 20ish my father died, just without any context. He was a special man, a good, humble, charming and really inteligent man. I love you so much dad. I fuckin' miss you, and I know that with you everything would be great.

With my dad alive, everything was kinda ok. At least I have my family; I was raised a lot of times with my granny, and I had a special connection with my little cousin (she was like my daughter, she only has her momma, and I am the only man on the family), as when she was born I was like 18 years old or so.

My dad died of stress, but everything was fucked up from there on: all my family turned my back on me and my mom because of the fuckin' money. I had no side to choose, as I had no money and I was living with my mother... and yet my mother started to blame my father for all the troubles. My mother, some one that almost did not work in her entire life, started to say bad things about a man that DIED because of his stressfull work (he was a police chief, and those night-shifts are mortal).

But gladly, I still had connections, things to go on. I had university, I had a girlfriend, then I had work, then I had sports again...

Yet things went really ugly, again. I finished university, I started to work, I get a new girlfriend, I started to do sports again... but everything ended.

My ex broke with me, and she doesn't wanna know ANYTHING about me. All because I was a closed guy, because I do not want to ""paint dark days in her beauty life"". I am desperately wanting to at least ""end everything in a good way"", yet I am a fuckin monster in her eyes.

At my hobbies, I couldn't train for months because of my late depression. And I see everyone getting better, and I am just getting stuck, and everyone surpassing me. And I am just a letter in a book, an ant in a colony.

And by work, yeah, my work is kinda stressful. I am the director in a company, yet I suffer from pressure from the ""ground workers"" and from my superiors. It is cool that I do not have to go to a normal 40h job, yet that kind of solitude kills me.

Just imagine my life;

In circa five years,

\- I lost my girfriend due to suicide

\- I do not have any friend because either they are too afraid when I open my ""pandora box"", or they go away because I am a closed human being.

\- When I asked for help to my family because of my mental problem, a lot of stigmas were into me

\- I was locked into a mental health hospital for months with 20 years

\- I lost my father

\- I was thinking to form a family with my exgirlfriend (3 years together), yet she dumped me because almost no reason

\- I lost all my family, only I have a manipulative mother and her stupid snob boyfriend. She is just a fucktoy to a rich man.

\- Everyone that I knew is against me. Even my mother talk bad things about me.

\- I have a fucked up brain.

&amp;#x200B;

And I could go on, and on, and on... but the hardest thing is that I could be one, two, three days, weeks or even months without sayin' anything and no one would make me a call. No one would come to my house and hug me. No one would smile at me, say something nice without wanting anything in to return.

It's not just my mental health. It's not only my shitty live. It's that nobody really cares.

It's the fact that, why I should fight?

Why I have to struggle with all this, everyday?I have NO ONE on my side. No one to talk, no one to hang out, no one to go to the cinema. No one to have fun, no one to eat some day. And that counting if I would like to.

Someday, my life is gonna end. And I know it it gonna be kinda soon, yet I do not want. I cry to sleep a lot of nights, because my mental pain, because my life... and because I am scared to die.  


Yet, there is no cure. I cannot hide all my past, all the pain. I cannot hide all my mental problems. 

What the fuck I am supposed to do? 

Hi Ted, yeah let's hang out. Ohhh  so you are sad because your dog is ill? Well, today, 5 years ago my girlfriend commited suicide, and 10 years ago some jerk in my high school broke all my teeth and was applauded by my entire class.

At my hobbies, I couldn't train for months because of my late depression. And I see everyone getting better, and I am just getting stuck, and everyone surpassing me. And I am just a letter in a book, an ant in a colony.

And by work, yeah, my work is kinda stressful. I am the director in a company, yet I suffer from pressure from the ""ground workers"" and from my superiors. It is cool that I do not have to go to a normal 40h job, yet that kind of solitude kills me.

Just imagine my life;

In circa five years,

\- I lost my girfriend due to suicide

\- I do not have any friend because either they are too afraid when I open my ""pandora box"", or they go away because I am a closed human being.

\- When I asked for help to my family because of my mental problem, a lot of stigmas were into me

\- I was locked into a mental health hospital for months with 20 years

\- I lost my father

\- I was thinking to form a family with my exgirlfriend (3 years together), yet she dumped me because almost no reason

\- I lost all my family, only I have a manipulative mother and her stupid snob boyfriend. She is just a fucktoy to a rich man.

\- Everyone that I knew is against me. Even my mother talk bad things about me.

\- I have a fucked up brain.

&amp;#x200B;

And I could go on, and on, and on... but the hardest thing is that I could be one, two, three days, weeks or even months without sayin' anything and no one would make me a call. No one would come to my house and hug me. No one would smile at me, say something nice without wanting anything in to return.

It's not just my mental health. It's not only my shitty live. It's that nobody really cares.

It's the fact that, why I should fight?

Why I have to struggle with all this, everyday?I have NO ONE on my side. No one to talk, no one to hang out, no one to go to the cinema. No one to have fun, no one to eat some day. And that counting if I would like to.

Someday, my life is gonna end. And I know it it gonna be kinda soon, yet I do not want. I cry to sleep a lot of nights, because my mental pain, because my life... and because I am scared to die.  


Yet, there is no cure. I cannot hide all my past, all the pain. I cannot hide all my mental problems. 

What the fuck I am supposed to do? 

Hi Ted, yeah let's hang out. Ohhh  so you are sad because your dog is ill? Well, today, 5 years ago my girlfriend commited suicide, and 10 years ago some jerk in my high school broke all my teeth and was applauded by my entire class. Ah besides that, I might be a psycho and I have depression and anxiety, ALL FUCKIN GOOD TED"
I ruined it,"**Forewarning, I have ZERO relationship experience, I made this clear to her in advance, but I cant help but think that I did or said something that caused the wrong idea.**

I met the **most amazing woman of the face of the Earth about two months ago. She is super sweet, kind, smart, funny, drop-dead gorgeous, and a dream to spend time with.** We originally met just to hookup, however we connected and she became an amazing friend. **By far the best thing to ever happen to me in my entire life**, no question. We weren't bf/gf, **we were us**, no labels. We hung out, went on dates, explored the city, and generally just spent time together, and it was so fun and felt so good. Anyway, the other day I received a text from her that she thinks we shouldn't see each other anymore, that things were going too fast and she wasn't comfortable or ready for it. Two hours before this she responded to a cute meme I sent her that was a ""cuddle coupon"" and she said she would be using it a lot. How it goes complete 180 turn in such a short time, **FUCK MY LIFE**. Frankly I'm devastated, I never intended to rush anything, in fact I was more than content being friends. I can't help but feel that I did something or said something that ruined it, and **I hate myself for causing the end of the best thing that has ever happened to me**. I feel like I was being toxic or asking for too much without realizing it. I am in so much pain. Now I am planning on improving myself, mainly to try and numb the pain, also hoping that our paths cross once again. **I place no blame on her, if she thinks its over, then I guess its over**, I respect her feelings. But god I feel so bad and miss her so much, **I'm afraid to sleep at night because I dream about her and feel even worse**. I cant focus on work, or family or anything, I've basically been crying nonstop. I feel like such a baby and such a burden. ""Why would she want to hang out with me anyway?"" I think to myself. Its so fucking painful. **I was truly, genuinely, happy for once in my life and now its over.** I fucking ruined it.  **I would do anything to be friends with her once again.** Her birthday is coming up and I think I'm gonna send her a card, which is probably the stupidest fucking thing imaginable, but I want to do it anyway.

Dependent on cannabis for depression,"I have been diagnosed with depression and as the title suggests, am dependent on cannabis for my depression. I have lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, feel completely empty, and spend the vast majority of my days lying in bed or on my computer trying to force myself to enjoy something to take the boredom away. I struggle to get out of the house, and I use cannabis daily, most of the time multiple times a day, and its the only thing in the world that seems to take the depression away and give me clarity. Alongside cannabis i also use nicotine to ease the pain a bit.

I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on medication for depression, and the meds I am currently taking have helped a lot, but they can only do so much. I have been on a multitude of different meds to try and combat depression but the only thing that can consistently help is cannabis. The only problem I have is that cannabis is expensive and I use it as a severe crutch to the point where i don't know what I would do without it.

Please help..,"First post here, because I don’t know where else to turn to. I’m a 31yo man serving in the military, who’s going through the worst period in my life. I’ve been suffering from depression since my ex-fiancé left me back in 2015. 

So here’s my story: 

My most recent gf (LDR) just broke up with me on Saturday. We were only together for 3 months, and half of that was extremely rocky due to my own fuck up. However, I knew almost immediately this was someone I could spend my life with. The first week we spent together was the greatest relationship experience I’ve ever had. If we had worked out, I already was very open to leaving the military, moving to her country, and being able to get a fresh start on life that I desperately need. 

I thought the breakup was a good idea at the time, but now that it’s hit me, all I want is to have back what we used to have. I don’t feel like I’ll ever be able to have anything that good ever again in my life. I’m on day two of no contact, and it’s eating me up inside. I honestly don’t know how to recover from this, and it’s affecting me worse than the loss of an 8 year relationship with my ex fiancé. I used the gym as a coping method with her, but now I’m recovering from a shoulder injury so that’s not an option. 

Now I feel like my life is in shambles. I lost the only person I looked forward to talking to every day, I lost the chance for a fresh start in a new country, I don’t have many close friends, I don’t have any hobbies and no ambition to acquire any, I’m not happy in my career but don’t have any idea what else I would do outside of it. All I do on a regular day is watch Netflix and sit in silence with my cats and smoke weed (legal for military here). 

I’m currently deployed for the next 2.5 weeks, staying just 5 minutes from where she lives. I have limited access to my mental health resources back home, so I don’t really know who to talk to. I don’t really have many friends I’m comfortable turning to, and I don’t like taking to my family about these issues. I just feel like I literally have nothing left in life. I still want to leave the military, but now I have nothing to look forward to after it. I have no interest in any other career field, I don’t want to go back to school, but I don’t want to take a massive pay cut and settle for a shit job. 

I’m not suicidal per se, but if I could push a button to poof out of existence, I wouldn’t think twice about it. I just want all the pain to be over.

I feel like I'm faking it all as an excuse to be mean.,"   I've not got an actual diagnosis for depression but I kind of think I may have it. But I'm a minor, so it's probably just stupid teenage angst. My parents don't really care, and I assume they're right. I mean, they've know I've been ""depressed"", self harming, and suicidal for years now and they haven't done anything. The best they've done is Dad stole my knife like two days ago. So it's definitely nothing. I just wish I could get over myself and stop causing my family more pain than necessary.    
    
   I don't know if I can though. It's nice to think I am depressed. That I have an excuse to be so lazy, so annoying, and so self pitying. My family hates how much of a martyr I am. I've been actively stopping them from punishing me. Hiding my stuff so they can't take it/throw it out a window. Being completely dismissive when they shout at me for the fifth time in two days. I'm really mean to them because a part of me feels like I have a right to be when they've ignored my ""depression"" and not helped me. But I do logically know I don't. That I'm just being cruel and borderline abusive.  
  
   So, yeah. My dad says he's kicking me out of his house (my parents are separated) tonight and I should find somewhere else, but I've already pissed my mum off so she won't want me. I think with this, coupled with my fake depression, the best way for me to stop being so cruel and feeling so bad is to just kill myself soon. I just wish my dad would leave the house so I could be alone.

Hello,"Hello, I'm axis105.  


I used to post here. I think my last post here was about 5 or 6 years ago though. Life has had its ups and downs since then. It's never quite gotten this bad though. The suicidal thoughts are back. 


I keep telling myself that deep down I want to exist. 


Maybe that's why I'm writing this. I want to let you know that I exist right now and that I think I want to keep existing. Maybe if I type it out it'll convince me.


 I could've done it. I drove down an empty stretch of highway for about an hour in a blizzard just a few hours ago. I thought about pressing on the gas and letting go of the wheel. I didn't though.

I guess I feel less of a need to ask how they are if they are managing not just one but both of these but depression is an uphill climb, not a battle, right?

I tend to think well he or she is seeking/getting help, so they are in a better place now, or is that faulty to assume? Is it ok to ask in depth like:

 What did you enjoy/like about the professional/psychiatrist/therapist/counselor, what did you not?

I guess I feel less of a need to ask how they are if they are managing not just one but both of these but depression is an uphill climb, not a battle, right?

I tend to think well he or she is seeking/getting help, so they are in a better place now, or is that faulty to assume? Is it ok to ask in depth like:

 What did you enjoy/like about the professional/psychiatrist/therapist/counselor, what did you not?

Getting Ghosted Sucks,"I was talking to this girl on a dating app and we really hit things off well. We were talking for a while and planned on meeting up for a movie at my place over the weekend and suddenly Friday afternoon she cancelled saying she had to go home as her mother was having surgery. This was not a lie and I know she was telling the truth and I wished her best of luck and said we'd reschedule. 

We talked for a bit during Saturday across both the dating app and Snapchat / Instagram. Suddenly I see she unfriended me on Snapchat and asked her why. She said it was an accident and that she doesn't really use snapchat anyways. I thought nothing of it because she seemed genuine but a lot of my female friends said it was a huge red flag and that a lot of effort is involved in unfriending someone on snapchat. 

I gave her some space and was going to hit her up today and ask how her mother was an suddenly she's vanished. She's nowhere in my conversation list on the dating app and blocked me on instagram and snapchat. Literally out of nowhere. 

I can't imagine why she felt the need to do me like that and if I was genuinely bothering her I wish she could have been honest about it instead of just ""accidentally"" unfriending me then blocking me a few days later. It really sucks because I've been in need of someone to cuddle with for the longest time - not even looking for sex and I made that clear. 

I'm so tired of getting played like this and I can't figure out a way to protect my feelings and its making me go downhill.",t2_10t2bv,3,0,1,"Getting Ghosted Sucks I was talking to this girl on a dating app and we really hit things off well.

I haven’t been happy for years,"I just can’t feel happy anymore. I constantly try to fake it by reflecting my friend’s happiness, but I personally cannot feel happy anymore. All I ever feel is varying levels of anger or nothing at all.

I will never find love (something I’ve been forced to accept under the knife since I’m too weak mentally, physically, and emotionally for anybody) and I scarcely make friends (it’s closer to people whose company I tolerate more than other people, as I personally don’t care about a soul on the planet including my family).

I constantly have horrid thoughts directed at either myself or others that I struggle to suppress daily, and crave nothing more than to suffer punishment through pain or death but do not have the courage to do anything myself.

My future is completely dead since I’m stuck in a college I can not afford because of my grandparents that won’t allow me to “waste my life” by not going to school (despite the fact that I don’t have any plans to live past 25) and all my backup plans involve being involved in some sort of criminal scheme since I know that standard working will just cause me to suffer even more.

"Maybe its for the best that I don't live anymore, women don't want me, no family, no friends.","I am almost 40, on disability morbidly obese and can't lose weight no matter how hard I try.   I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. 

I am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. 

I spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.

I have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. 

Renting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.

I feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. 

I applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. 

I spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. 

Two years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. 

Spent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.

I got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...

I just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. 

I also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. 

I have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum.

Fuck daylight savings.,"Just when I was getting used to my same sleep deprived schedule of waking up at 6, we lose a freaking hour so now I'm waking up at ""7"", late to school, had my parents yell at me all night for not being able to fall asleep until 12pm (when my body is really telling me it's 11), and now they're gonna yell at me a-fucking-gain for oversleeping. I'm probably grounded now. :)

"Things have objectively never been better, but I am tired.","I moved, changed jobs, have a great boss and an amazing new hometown. But I also have ongoing struggles with brain injuries that I have been fighting for years to get treated for, and which got dramatically worse after an accident last summer. I’m normally extremely active and every part of my life has been limited by this pressure in my head that I can’t get anyone to address. TBI doc says neurology, neurologist says TBI doc. Everyone sees this apparently fit person because I’ve been eating very carefully, but they don’t know what I used to look like or how restricted I am. It’s frustrating being pressured to join them for runs, surfing, anything. Even getting up early to work out; it is physically painful in the mornings if I still need more sleep and I have to prioritize that. I’m military so there’s particularly high pressure to be active and not a lot of understanding when I look okay. I can’t drink anymore. I can’t do anything or be anywhere that will raise the pressure in my head, and I suffer from migraines on a daily basis, as well as some other physical issues I don’t feel like I can focus on right now. I also have PTSD, which overlaps and complicates things, though I don’t know exactly where or how. I do know I am triggered by these symptoms and dealing with doctors. 

Last week I had a procedure done and had a negative reaction that caused my system to crash. While they were working on me I felt like I was forcing myself to breath and thought, maybe this is my out. Maybe I can stop fighting and just drift away. I let go for a couple seconds but the pain kept me awake. I realize now the doctors wouldn’t have let that happen anyway. But I don’t have a strong connection to being alive. I don’t want to kill myself, but I’m ambivalent about being alive. I don’t have family and I don’t feel close enough to anyone who wouldn’t negatively impact my career. I’m hoping just talking here will help. I have an appt this week to continue therapy and will bring this up, but I am unconvinced anyone can help me (I’ve been in therapy for a few years with various therapists).",t2_5we1g910,2,0,1,"Things have objectively never been better, but I am tired.

Okay, so I really hate school (this isn't uncommon) cause just as students are getting a week off from school, teachers give us some big ass projects.

"On the connection between depression, isolation, and hyper alertness to threats","I've noticed this pattern where as a I slip 
into depression I isolate myself by exaggerating the flaws in my relationships with friends/family and using those as justification to distance myself from them. As I become more isolated I tend to perceive neutral gestures as more hostile. Everyone is percieved as the enemy. From an evolutionary perspective I guess that sorta makes sense. If a cave person were to be separated from their tribe they would be very vulnerable and it would be advantageous to percieve more interactions as threatening as isolation world mean constant danger.

I feel lost,"My grammar might be bad, sorry about that. Might be a long text but I wanted to share it with someone, to ask for advice and to know if what I am doing is wrong or if it's already too late for me.

I'm 25, have a dead-end part-time job and started going to college almost 2 years ago. I'm studying a short career related to IT, something like a bachelor degree. And in my free time I study programming to, to complement the career.

I feel like I wasted my life between 18, when I graduated high school, and 23, when I realized the mistake I was doing, and that my life was going nowhere.

Last year I was excited, I finally started going to college, I would make some friends there as I was quite a loner. Finally get a good job to move out and finally be independent, etc etc.

At the begging it was nice, talked to people, finally doing something with my life. Made a few ""friends"" in college, started to visit some extended family and made more friends, which invited me to clubs, to go out and experience thing I never did. Finally lost weight, started going to the gym, started running, to be healthy in general.

But then I struggled with some classes, mostly maths. After some months the ""friends"" I had dropped out or changed classes. I'm shy, and have some problems making friends so classes started to be quite lonely too.

I felt that I was ready to find some jobs related to IT so I started looking for them. Had a bunch of interviews, was the first time I had to deal with something like that. To compete with more people for a job, to promote myself, to interact with a lot of people. But I did fine I think, with some bumps here and there. 

In the meantime I got to know a girl in a family event, their family is friends with one of our relatives. Event though I'm really bad at being social, I decided to ask my friend to help me, as some sort of ""wingman"", to give my number to her and If she wanted we could start to know each other.

As my intentions were somewhat clear, I think it was easier for my to talk with her. I'm really bad with girls, as I went to an almost all boys high school, and have little to no experience with them.

Things went well, It was like I was another person. We went to a few dates, had some ups and downs but I think we are doing fine. She said she really likes me and, and I really like her too.

I feel like I don't deserve her, she is younger than me and started college like 1 year ago too. She is a nice girl,active, social,  sweet, family oriented and has her own hobbies and life. Its's like the opposite of me, I feel inadequate. But I want to be a good match, a good man. To be someone who deserves her.

But I'm still struggling, still got no full-time job. In one interview I did well and got a second interview which I did fine too. They called me because and told me that I was selected, and I had to do some medical studies, and some other things to be hired. I did everything they asked me to, they said everything was fine and that they would contact me again to tell me  the  work start date. I was really happy at that time, but this was like 3 moths ago, they told me they had some difficulties with the projects I was supposed to be working with, and barely keep me updated. I passed some opportunities waiting for them, and I feel like a moron, frustrated, disappointed. So in the meantime I looking for another job in the field again, and have an interview in some days. Not the best offer but I need something.

I feel like time is passing, that I'm going to reach a point of no return. That it's going to be too late for me.

I know that I started late, and it really makes me anxious when I see how some friends progressed and how far they are.

These past few weeks, as we haven't started classes yet, Ive been feeling down. Low energy, tired, started to eat like crap, not going to the gym and not running. Feels like all its going down.

I dont want to feel like this, I want to be excited about life again. To be active, to finally work, I want to go to classes and feel useful, that I'm not wasting my time.

Everyone says find a hobby.,"So I taught myself to play the piano. I can’t stop, it’s like a fixation. It’s all I want to do now.

I'm in a weird place in my recovery,"I'm new to this site so a little tentative about it all.

I've been using another site/forum for quite a while but there were some limitations there so that's what brings me here. I'm very scared as I don't know anyone here! I am used to using an online forum but any tips from some of the regulars here would be welcome.

So I'll try to keep this short. I had a major breakdown a few years ago and a minor relapse a couple of years after that. I've been working hard at my recovery but I don't really know the next step to take.

Depression is definitely one of the things I struggle with but anxiety very much too. There's so much more I want to do but I'm feeling kind of stuck. Like sometimes I can't seem to move out of the mindset of being 'ill' into a better mindset where I even forget that I'm ill (does that even exist?).

I guess my biggest issue right now is finding a balance between online support and real-life support.

[Serious] I'm lost -- does anyone have some advice?,"I've been subscribed to this community for ages now on my main account, but I'm never brave enough to post. But I need some advice, so I'm using a throwaway...

I'm 18, almost 19, and I've been depressed (with other mental illnesses as well) on and off since I was 10 when my life sort of started crumbling and it's never stopped. It fluctuates; I've had better months and terrible months. Life hasn't been too kind to me and I've lost a lot. I've lost family members, I lost every friend I'd had since I was little, I lost beloved pets...I've even lost any sense of self-worth or self-confidence that's turned into a pretty nasty case of self-loathing.

Over the years I've been suicidal and not suicidal. My first thought of suicide was when I was 10 when I seriously considered drowning myself in the pool of our school gym. My coping mechanisms range from outright disassociation and non-stop daydreaming to self-harm. 

The last six months have been pretty good ones with the odd low period here and there. I have a lot of emotional baggage and trust issues from multiple things from abuse to severe bullying that never seems to go away, but they haven't been as bad. Six months ago I also got my first girlfriend (I'm a lesbian) which I don't think was a coincidence. Even though the relationship was mostly long-distance, we both supported each other through good times and bad times. She made me laugh, she made me smile, I even stopped having to go to my therapist every single week because I was starting to be happy again. She was my support network and my best friend --- and I don't have any other friends. I live my life in complete solitude; no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to make friends. 

Because of my family's homophobia, the relationship was kept a secret. I told my therapist and one other person, but that was it. 

Friday night I was talking to her on the phone as usual and seemingly out of nowhere, she broke up with me. I think she was hoping the feeling would be mutual, we'd had a few communication problems over the last month or so, but I just thought that all relationships have their struggles. 

She said it was for my benefit, it was better that way. I told her that I'm 19 years old and I can make my own decisions; if I thought I needed something else I wouldn't still be trying to make things work. 

When she realized that that approach wasn't going to work, I guess she told me the plain truth: she can't handle my issues. 

She can't be there for me like I deserve, she says.   
She can't keep supporting me with all my ""problems."" The depression, the panics, the flashbacks, the baggage.  
It's not my fault, she says, she's being selfish and doing what's best for her. 

I love this girl more than anything, so I didn't argue. I will put her before myself, and if this isn't what she wants then I don't want her to stay. 

""You have every right to be angry,"" she said.   
""I'm not mad,"" I explained through tears, ""I'm f\*\*\*\*\*g devastated."" 

I cried that night.  
I cried the entirety of Saturday.  
I went to orchestra rehearsal on Sunday and ended up crying in front of people when someone asked if I was okay, and in one of my lectures yesterday, I started crying in front of my concerned professor. 

It's pretty safe to say that I'm basically shattered. In one night I lost everything, again.

I understand. I'm not angry with her at all; I get it. Loving someone who's as screwed up as I am is hard. 

But she made big promises to me that I believed, even though I knew better. I'm in shock, I'm devastated, I never saw it coming. I feel broken. 

And I'm angry. Livid. Absolutely furious...not at her, but at me. 

Here's the thing, I'm basically worthless, and I'm well aware of this fact. In life, I'm about as useful as a snowshoe is to a deep-sea worm. It was amazing to me that she would love me in the first place...and, well, I guess we're back to the point that gets proven every single time; it's not really possible to like me for very long. I learned a while ago that everyone gets sick of me eventually and runs for the hills. I just wanted to prove myself wrong. 

I guess the point to all of this is, I'm all alone and any self-worth I'd gained went straight down the drain. I'm angry at myself for being sick, even though I know it isn't logical; I look in the mirror and I'm filled with this...burning rage that I never feel toward anything else. I want to reach through the glass and grab the person staring back; I hate her, I loathe her, I want to hurt her, I want to make her suffer. When I look in the mirror I think horrible things that I've never thought toward anyone else. 

These last few days I've been rapidly deteriorating, and if suicide was an option I would happily take it. I dream of just closing my eyes and drifting off into nothing almost constantly. I couldn't tell you what any of my professors said in lectures yesterday because I just let the daydreaming take over and take me off somewhere where I wasn't hurting so badly. 

I barely remember anything that I did at work today except clocking in, and then feeling as though I kind of wandered around in a cloud of fog for a little while and suddenly someone was there to relieve me at the registers. Six hours passed and I don't remember them. I exist and yet I don't. It's like I detached myself from my own body so I don't feel what she feels anymore --- sometimes it feels like my mind and my physical body are two different people which is why I often refer to my body as ""she.""

I need some help. I need to figure out what to do; three days of disassociating and it's already affecting my schoolwork. I promised her that I wouldn't cut myself, but it's so hard not to pick up the blade and take the pain away. 

I'm lost, but some logical little voice keeps telling me that I can't go on like this. I'm afraid of what I might do to myself, not for my own sake but for the sake of my family; if I killed myself, it would destroy my parents. I feel like I want to strip away everything that makes me...me...since I'm not somebody who people want to be around. I'm just hoping that someone has some way for me to get through this without picking up a razor blade or just losing my grip on reality completely.

Let's make light of my crippling depression for a moment,"**Stupid thing to say No. 1:**""Just think about how lucky you are!"" ...Sweet Jesus. You've cured me....

Okay, I'm not going to start by saying I'm not actually lucky. I have a good life with a loving husband and a daughter in an area I like and blah blah blah. I guess I should acknowledge that I'm capable of ""seeing the bright side."" But that brain of mine doesn't give a flying fart in space about that when it gets rough. Instead it goes something like this:

""You're right our daughter is so cute and smart... Dear god I'm going to screw her up somehow. What if she turns into a crackhead?  God, I'm so selfish for having a child when my brain works like this. What if she goes through this? I love her so much I want to cry. I just want to hug her and play with her all day. But actually please be tired and go to bed because I'm having a mental breakdown. I'd love to get up and play with her but me needy the couchy and a nice warm blanket. And the shades drawn. And movies. And lots of cake. Do we have beef jerky? I'm going to eat all the cheese. Then I'll be happy.. for like ten seconds until I feel bad about everything I just ate and go into a food coma simultaneously. I think I'll start a cleanse and eat healthy. (goes to the store) Better buy oreos just in case! (Eats oreos and a pint of ben and jerry's) Dear god I'll always be this fat....""

You get the picture. Yes, I'm very ""lucky"" to think like this.... all day...everyday. I'm so thankful for my ability to turn positive things into miserable piles of garbage. No. It's not always this humorous.

So as I'm breaking myself down, people think its a good idea to remind me that I'm crappy at appreciating my life. I get why non-depressed people think that might be a good idea, but it is so, so misguided. Does anyone just go, ""Wow, I see that you are questioning your self-worth and disgustingly anxious. Let me just say you are really good at (insert something positive here). The world is a better place because you routinely do that thing.""?

No. No, they don't. They just assume that in the overwhelming chaos that is my brain I'm capable of forming a rational positive thought about my value on planet earth with that broad nonsense.

So what's depression like? Let's put it in perspective. It's like playing a game of freeze tag with yourself except nobody likes playing and its awful. 

**Actual depression freeze tag reviews:**

""I just couldn't stop playing!""- *Girl stuck in the well during the Silence of the Lambs film*.

""Whoopsie Daisy!""-*(insert deity of choice here)*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is the part of the post where I'm supposed to say something uplifting and helpful... So how do you ""fight depression and anxiety?"" Who the hell knows? I'm still worrying about it while I've become one with my couch. If you figure it out, feel free to reach out. I'll be here with my Ben and Jerry's in pajamas I haven't changed out of in two days not engaging in any part of society and ordering take out online because calling in an order or making food is too stressful and exhausting. ",t2_x5jhr,1,0,1,"Let's make light of my crippling depression for a moment **Stupid thing to say No. 1:**""Just think about how lucky you are!"" ...Sweet Jesus.

What if she turns into a crackhead?  God, I'm so selfish for having a child when my brain works like this. What if she goes through this? I love her so much I want to cry. I just want to hug her and play with her all day. But actually please be tired and go to bed because I'm having a mental breakdown. I'd love to get up and play with her but me needy the couchy and a nice warm blanket. And the shades drawn. And movies. And lots of cake. Do we have beef jerky? I'm going to eat all the cheese. Then I'll be happy.. for like ten seconds until I feel bad about everything I just ate and go into a food coma simultaneously. I think I'll start a cleanse and eat healthy. (goes to the store) Better buy oreos just in case! (Eats oreos and a pint of ben and jerry's) Dear god I'll always be this fat....""

You get the picture. Yes, I'm very ""lucky"" to think like this.... all day...everyday. I'm so thankful for my ability to turn positive things into miserable piles of garbage. No. It's not always this humorous.

So as I'm breaking myself down, people think its a good idea to remind me that I'm crappy at appreciating my life. I get why non-depressed people think that might be a good idea, but it is so, so misguided. Does anyone just go, ""Wow, I see that you are questioning your self-worth and disgustingly anxious. Let me just say you are really good at (insert something positive here). The world is a better place because you routinely do that thing.""?

No. No, they don't. They just assume that in the overwhelming chaos that is my brain I'm capable of forming a rational positive thought about my value on planet earth with that broad nonsense.

So what's depression like? Let's put it in perspective. It's like playing a game of freeze tag with yourself except nobody likes playing and its awful. 

**Actual depression freeze tag reviews:** 

""This game is the tits."" -*Hell Weekly*.

""I just couldn't stop playing!""- *Girl stuck in the well during the Silence of the Lambs film*.

""Whoopsie Daisy!""-*(insert deity of choice here)*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is the part of the post where I'm supposed to say something uplifting and helpful... So how do you ""fight depression and anxiety?"" Who the hell knows? I'm still worrying about it while I've become one with my couch. If you figure it out, feel free to reach out. I'll be here with my Ben and Jerry's in pajamas I haven't changed out of in two days not engaging in any part of society and ordering take out online because calling in an order or making food is too stressful and exhausting. "
I lost the only thing I was looking forward to,"There was supposed to be a concert today. It was a fairly cheap ticket so I was rly happy that i wouldn’t have to burden my parents too much and I was just rly looking forward to it.

But yesterday my parents rly didn’t want me to go Bc they were scared about the coronavirus. I honestly don’t care if I get it and die but my parents are at a higher risk of dying if I somehow get it and pass it on to them so I gave up on going.

Making friends/being social is an impossible task,"Trying to make friends and be social is very hard for me. It's always been something I've struggled with. Systematically, I would either purposely ruin my friendships (behave oddly/irritatingly, refuse to hang out, not respond to messages/calls/texts, start finding reasons to not be friends, ect) or ghost people to the point of being strangers. When these friendships would die off, I'd have a little bit of sadness, a bit of relief, a bit of anger, and then it would fizzle out to a hazy memory. I'd almost become apathetic and *maybe* reminisce or lament the past but that's about the extent of it. I just don't know why it's always been like this but it feels like I just can't tolerate the idea of having friends.

It's hard because I do think (?) I'm lonely. Like I long to have platonic companionship but I just can't seem to make the effort. I've tried Discord, Telegram, Facebook, and other communities irl but I can never bring myself to commit. Or worse, I start sabotaging myself even if everything is going well. Even if the other person puts in all the work, I will not make the effort and I can't convince myself to do more than a polite refusal or a vague excuse. It's even worse in that I just don't even feel connected to the people who call me their friend so it's not like I'm so unlikable people avoid me but I still feel like I'm faking them out every day.

Hope.,"
I live by not getting my hopes up.

All that is out the window today, today I’m getting my hopes up, and praying everything works itself out.


I have had people reach out to me, possibly saving my literal life. They don’t even know how bad I need the help.


For me I always had to do it solo, no handouts, I was the person who was the helper.


It runs in the family.


Here today, I survived my first night!
17 more days to go.


I have hope that these people will help me!
Nothing’s promised, so I need to be planning for backup plans as well.


But, for a guy like me that has no one to help me, for strangers on the internet, I can’t believe people care. 

Why does the world feel so crappy, why does real life human interactions not feel like this?


I was almost 100% sure everyone was a bot or faking human interactions but now, idk.

Oh man, I can’t wait to pay them back tho, like, man I when I get stable again, I going to pay it forward LIKE NEVER BEFORE!

Ugh, why are my hopes so high...

Like I can see myself in the car, breaking down if I get let down, but then I can’t even be mad at being let down, because you got your hopes up!

But idk idk idk, when you don’t have much else to do but wait on other people your kinda in a bad spot.

Waiting 24 hours for “temporary housing applications “ whyyyy!!!!!

And then had the nerve to say because I’m 100% through the va, I might make to much for assistance? Seriously? I’m homeless.

Man I swear, the older I get the more see that people just have to push buttons or write on paper and things can happen. 


Just wish I had ONE FRIEND who owned an apartment complex and was like, my dude, I know your a good guy, so here you go a place to stay, Pay me when ur check comes in.


Ok I’ll admit that’s a bit far fetched, unrealistic, but guaranteed someone’s doing it for someone!

Love how it’s always “my fault”,"My dad is having money problems? That’s my fault. Cause he has to buy me food and provide for my overall well-being as his child. The house is a mess? It’s my fault. Even though it’s obvious both my dad and I are depressed and don’t have the motivation to do anything. But everybody teams up, I.e. my brother and his wife, with my dad, and blames it all on me. Saying I could do more and need to stop hiding in my room all the time. I don’t have my license yet? My fault because my dad would rather drink and basically drift in and out of consciousness all day, and then blame me for not getting my driving time in when I don’t wanna drive in the middle of the night with him barely conscious in the passenger seat. Not to mention the only time he wants to go and do driving is, of course, to buy more alcohol! Like he did tonight. He literally hides a giant bottle of vodka from me and takes swigs of it at the same time as drinking a beer or moonshine. And I guarantee you most of that is being bought when I’m at work or out with others. So in a way, I’m not looking froward to getting my license because I’m just gonna be his chauffeur for a “beer run” like three times a week. Cause that’s all I’m good for. And even then I’m not good enough. 

I hide out in my room cause I’ve got nothing better to do and don’t wanna be around anyone? Everybody must need to talk trash about me as a result. Instead of, you know, asking what’s wrong, how about talking about me behind my back and then screaming at me about staying in my room all the time? That’s what my dad and brother do apparently. My dad revealed in the middle of one his bi polar episodes last weekend, that my brother said I don’t do enough around the house and would rather team up with my dad and make me out to be the villain. I already can’t stand him so he really didn’t do himself any favors by doing that. Just further confirmed to me that I can’t trust him or his wife. Which I already knew but whatever. 

I just adore the fact that EVERYTHING, is my fault. And if I get mad about it? Oh I’m in for hell! I’m not allowed to get mad about anything my “family” does. Cause they’re all perfect, and so is their reasoning. Me on the other hand? I’m just your typical whiny teenager so who cares what I think?

This is just a venting on my current situation - jobs and businesses,"I'm not well. I still have those days where my ocd scares the shit out of me,where I spend hours on end ruminating my thoughts. I still feel like I can't find a job just yet.

My first and last job was during all June last year - after that my ocd exploded to where I couldn't leave the house. I spent so many months scared to find therapy because I was scared to be misdiagnosed.

I'm better now... Much better! But I still have those peaks of anxiety (according to my therapist) it's not panic attacks... I can't breathe during those moments and I'm afraid to be tossed aside by my peers.

Finding a job here is very complicated... It's so hard and no one wants to hire someone with social anxiety (they can see that in my face). I'm actually great with customers. I'm nice and people are open to me and chat with me. The biggest problem here is  coworkers. They are mean and sarcastic. And this is in any job! I don't understand... I truly don't. I just want to do my job but they are never satisfied... 

I worked in a supermarket for a whole month. It wasn't great. If I may say so myself I was the best at dealing with customers. I was very nice. I am a nice person! I don't show that annoyed face that my co workers used to show. People liked me and asked me questions because I had a nice young face... This is not to brag, just something I noticed. (maybe that's why they put me as a cashier a lot). But I was weak and not fast enough... And my co workers were mean to each other. I hated going to work... I loved working as a cashier because I like to do the same tasks... I was OK at it and whenever there was a mild problem Id solve it myself (illegally &gt;&gt; let's say I gave a lot of free stuff to people) but I was bad at everything else... And I was constantly afraid of not being fast enough or good enough and having to talk with my coworkers was a nightmare for me... It was really stressful but I wanted to endure it as an experience and to work hard. But I couldn't handle it... Also my dad was a big problem... He was so controlling that he'd pick me up at work and sometimes yell to my managers (there's a lot of stories arounf this but I want to keep this post as short as possible) so I couldn't handle to stay there more than a month. 

My family is forcing me to open a business of my own with their money. I feel so bad for that because I don't want to spend *their* money and be in *their* debt. It's not my money. It's theirs. I don't want to feel guilty for not working for that money if it makes sense. I feel like I have to suffer to be happy. Plus, I want to leave my family and live alone... I won't live here forever... I don't want to live in this city forever! I want to save money and go away with my gf to somewhere nice and healthy.

I feel like if I use their money, they will control me or keep me here... Not only that, it's not right to use their money..

I'm a terrible person... I love my family but sometimes they annoy me... And I feel bad for thinking that about them. My therapist has been opening my eyes to my ""not-healthy"" family and I have been feeling more defensive to them lately. I just hate my personality. I'm trying to change but for some reason I always come back to what I was.

I'm so afraid to not be good enough to my gf... She deserves so much better...

I feel like I want to kill myself again for the first time in a few years,"I've been having a hard time recently and randomly typed watched a video about suicide. It made me tear up and acknowledge how much I've been thinking of killing myself recently.

My last suicidal thoughts were a few years ago, and they were the worst since they came with a plan. I never felt so low and once out of it I never thought I'd feel this way again.

It's fucking stupid, my family are amazing and my friends are amazing. I love them stupid amounts. But I've suffered from depression for years. And it's held me back. My job at the moment, my colleagues are cool, the pay is fairly good, but it gives me so much anxiety. I feel at breaking point. 

For someone who has social anxiety, to be speaking to customers all day does me no good. And the system that tracks everything is flawed, my bosses targets are stupidly high. And his assistant, personally I get on with her and like her, but she has taken an interest in my figures and wants to bring up an inconsistency with what she reports and what I report. I've told you so many times that the system makes duplicates and the figures I've been trained to follow doesn't follow my call outs, but no one fucking listens and I feel like I'm constantly scrutinized and don't receive any praise. 

Yeah, if you have social anxiety why would you apply for jobs that involve speaking to customers? I couldn't complete university because of my mental health issues and it turns out majority of basic jobs that you don't need a degree for involve customer interaction mainly.

The thought of going back to work tomorrow is putting me on the verge of a panic attack or a breakdown. I've been thinking about killing myself. I've been at my job for a year now but if I feel like I couldn't be honest about my struggles because I'd be either told to get on with it or just take unpaid leave.

How do I strip myself of the mask I wear?,"I am in therapy, I am working on this with them.  


My therapist just hearkened back to a personality trait that friends and significant others past and present have brought to my attention within the last 6 years: I am a good actor. I am an empath, I care so deeply for other people and their problems/joys, but when I am asked to open up in return I choose to hide my emotions away. I want to cry. I want to cry very often, and that's not socially acceptable, so I boxed it up a long time ago. Now I don't feel anything except the occasional overdose of fear or apathy.  


I notice that these emotions are linked- this happens frequently. I get numb in that I notice I am not experiencing emotion at all, and sometimes that numbness is so intense that I mistake it for embarrassment. My body heats up, my cheeks flush, I shake; it's almost like a panic, but I cannot think of anything in that moment, and I don't feel anything except fear.  


I was raped by my now-ex for 2 1/2 years, I lost myself somewhere in there, and I wore a mask to protect myself from my family when we were together. I wore it to protect myself from him, so that his rejection of things I wanted to do didn't hurt so much. I wore it because I lost my job trying to help a suicidal student when I was in college. I wore it to make that hurt and shame go away; the mask made it seem like I was confident to my superiors, they stopped second-guessing me when I wasn't a nervous wreck in front of them. My ex stopped being such an asshole when I complied; I saved face for so long.  


It goes back even further. I used to cry in elementary school for no reason. Someone would look at me and start to say hello, I would start crying. Someone brushed my shoulder? Crying. Walking down the hallway? Crying. I never understood why that would happen, but my classmates eventually brought it up to me in a derogatory way when I was in like...3rd or 4th grade. I had a crush on a boy and he rejected me because I was too sensitive. He didn't want to be with someone who cried so much.  


I wore it when I was bullied by a group of pretty girls in school, I was always bigger than they were, I felt like I wasn't as pretty. I compared myself to them often, and put up that mask to ward off their taunting; it made it stop hurting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wore it when my best friend group went behind my back and started a rumor that I was gay, and that I had touched my friend. I hadn't hung out with them in months, but when I went to school the day after they lit that flame, I was tormented. No one wanted to associate with me. I grew closer to my teachers instead, and that got me through the last of those months until graduation, but it was still hell. People shoved pieces of paper into my desk that said, ""Die dyke,"" on them. I was tripped and spat on at recess. I had a slushee thrown at me on picture day. I had food and a tray thrown at me, and the kid's mom only caught me throwing said food and tray back at her kid, so she made me pick everyone's trash up at that table, and then had the audacity to grab me by my arm and drag me outside of the lunch room to scold me. For something that her child deserved. The girl scout troop my mom had worked so hard to build disbanded because the moms hated me; they didn't want their daughters associating with a family like mine.  


When no one volunteered to sit with me upstairs because I broke my leg, I broke. And I placed my mask. I deadened my emotions so I wouldn't cry, so I wouldn't be hurt by the rejection I felt.  


I don't want to devalue these experiences, as much as part of me belittles them and thinks them trivial. I belittle them because I think you will, too. I'm anticipating your reactions so it doesn't hurt.

"I lost my GF and everything in between, hope, suicide is not an option","Hi,

Long story short, I'm experiencing depression and major anxiety(social, physical) since 2017. The silent killer started right when I finished highschool, until then I thought that the national test, final highschool exam, before going to college is the purpose that we have since we are little, at least this was my experience, my parents and my teachers always told me: be careful, you re going to have your national final exam soon!

After I aced that test, I had no idea what I wanted to do but since half of my closest friends  were going to the country's capital to study there, I started going to law school since September, 2017. I was renting an apartment with one of my friends. In that same month, I met a girl from my local city who was also going to study in the capital. We talked for 2-3 weeks and then we met, had a couple of dates, I instantly fell in love with her, she was literally my dream girl, the only thing that I was a bit skeptical about was the fact that she was clinical depressed because her father died a few years ago. When it comes to girls, dates and all the things in between, I feel confident and playful. But I could not even lean in for a kiss or a hug with this girl on any of our dates, it was all about talking, we would talk for 6 hours straight without getting bored. I was feeling that she is very cold, I assumed she has trust issues or anxiety since every girl that I talked to or went out with tried to at least hug me, or slap me. But this girl had no reaction whatsoever whenever we would have met or when she had to go home, she would always be like ok i have to go, bye, not even in a rude way I could tell she is really shy and anxious. Eventually with the risk of being very needy I confessed my feelings to her, told her how much I like her etc. she refused me by explaining to me that at that time she would not have felt comfortable having a relationship with me because she didn t want to hurt me. I called that a bullshit, kept stalking her for a few months, meanwhile I dropped out of college because I had missed so many classes due to what I used to call at that time: laziness.

So I went back home, in my local city, over the next months I noticed that I am no longer able to breathe normally. Basically I did not know but I had every physical symptom of anxiety. My parents were dissapointed that I dropped out of college, they paid for my rent and food in the capital so I felt really bad for that. They are living in another country so I stayed with my grandma in my local city. So winter-spring 2018, I used to play video-games, did not take showers, would meet up with friends once a week maybe, could not breathe, got angry because of that so the result was that I could not breathe at all. Same thing, different days, I was a mess. In this period of time, I used to stalk that girl, I was ashamed of myself, how can I be so needy, buthurt etc. She would text me once in a while to ask me what's up, at the beggining I was trying not to care and to show her that I do not care anymore but I would have ended up being even more needy...anyway nothing happened she would ghost me, I would get upset and the conversation was gone.

July, 2018. I applied for a marketing degree, again in the capital, rented up an apartement with that same friend and another one who was also going to the same classes as I would go to. This time I attended classes, I had decent grades, this girl would still conctact me from time to time, same old story: cocky-needy-ghosting, met some girls, they would literally invite me to have sex with them every day, I never did go tho. All of my friends were making fun of me for refusing to go, but I could simply not explain to them that I do not feel confortable to do that because I have no emotional attaction to these girls even if they are hot. Long story short first year at that college was ok..I still had only 2 friends in the city, the ones in my apartment.

April 2019: This is the beggining of the end. I was in my local city for the spring break. That same girl that I could not forget texted me and wanted to meet up that night. I said ok, we saw each other, talked for hours, then she said she has to go, I took her to her place then I went home. She wanted to go out again the next day, and after that the next day and so on until she told me that she regrets not trying to get into a relationship with me since the beggining. Long story short we got together, I swear on my life that I would never forget April, June and July of 2019 because these months were the happiest months I have ever lived. I could share tear of joy. We would sleep at my place 5-6 days out of 7 right from week 2. The sex was amazing, the connection, the intimacy of just sleeping next to each other. We literally did everything together in those 3 moths, I felt like I finally get to be happy, I genuinely thought that she is my soulmate and that I want to marry her. Then things started to turn around in a bad way. Sooner or later we had to go back to the capital because the summer break was almost over. Since I spent all summer with her and some of my friends, I neglected the other friends who were my roomates. One of them decided to move in with another guy and the other one with his gf. This girl proposed to me to rent an aroatment together, I was a bit skeptical about this but I decided to go for it. The closer the autumn was getting, the less sex we had, and actually the more depressed she would be. 

September-December 2020 No sex, fighting almost everyday, she got more depressed because she had to go to work and at college at the same time. Her friends are rich, she would always get angry for not being as rich or as cool as her friends. I always told her that she is the most beautiful, smartest of them all but she did not care anymore about my opinion. I started to miss classes because I reopened the laziness mood for literally no reason, it just happened because we would fight 5 days out of 7. I was angry due to the lack of sexual life, she was angry that she has to go to work, college and to have a social life at the same time. She is obsessed with having social life, the perfect instagram, the perfect circle of friends, boyfriend with designer clothes, etc. She was always like this except those 3 months when she was genuienly happy. Eventually I dropped out of college because going to those classes would make me sick, she would also make me angry, the only thing that I enjoyed were the video games. Started playing a lot, she got upset, enetually broke up with me because of my lack of motivation, started talking with another dudes because I checker her social media account. The point until here is that this time I was the purposeless, depressed one who needed help, for 6 months everytime she would get just a bit depressed or having panic attacks, fights with her mother I would have came in seconds to protect and support her, I fell one time off the wagon and she literally dumped me herself. I had no friends, only her, could not tell my parents that I dropped out of college again so I got a job, she wanted to get back together, I agreed, still no sex, she would still be depressed because she has no materialistical things that she can enjoy in her life, over the last 2 months of 2020 she started going to clubs with her friends, she always asked me to go with her but she did not seem very interested to convince me to join them, eventually found out that she talked to another guy, and got excited because a popular rich guy who also likes clubbing wanted to date her, confronted her about it, she lied to my face, broke up with her, the next day I asked her if she also thinks that this was the right decision and she said yes. She would hug or kiss  me once a day now, she still looks very unhappy, at the moment we still live in the same place, we are stuck like this for 1 month or 2. I know it's a lot, its the first time i am posting, i did not mention everything because so much had happened. the point is that i  have no purpose now, i am literally heartbroken i can feel pain in my heart every night that i would think about the fact that this is over and she alresdy moved on. i am sick of crying every day, I legit wanted to kill myself the other night but i can never do this to my parents who love me so much, I love them but i can not live one more week on this earth. i am so sad, tired of this life. i feel like this girl literally destoyed me. idk what to do. if u cant give me advice its ok, i just wanted to share my story because i have no friends who i can talk with.

tldr: depression and anxiety for 3 years, gf dumped me because i do not have money, social exposure to offer nor the motivation stat, i can not stop the pain, its been thousands of hours. advice?",t2_3etj6vpl,1,0,1,"I lost my GF and everything in between, hope, suicide is not an option Hi,

Long story short, I'm experiencing depression and major anxiety(social, physical) since 2017. The silent killer started right when I finished highschool, until then I thought that the national test, final highschool exam, before going to college is the purpose that we have since we are little, at least this was my experience, my parents and my teachers always told me: be careful, you re going to have your national final exam soon!

After I aced that test, I had no idea what I wanted to do but since half of my closest friends  were going to the country's capital to study there, I started going to law school since September, 2017. I was renting an apartment with one of my friends. In that same month, I met a girl from my local city who was also going to study in the capital. We talked for 2-3 weeks and then we met, had a couple of dates, I instantly fell in love with her, she was literally my dream girl, the only thing that I was a bit skeptical about was the fact that she was clinical depressed because her father died a few years ago. When it comes to girls, dates and all the things in between, I feel confident and playful. But I could not even lean in for a kiss or a hug with this girl on any of our dates, it was all about talking, we would talk for 6 hours straight without getting bored. I was feeling that she is very cold, I assumed she has trust issues or anxiety since every girl that I talked to or went out with tried to at least hug me, or slap me. But this girl had no reaction whatsoever whenever we would have met or when she had to go home, she would always be like ok i have to go, bye, not even in a rude way I could tell she is really shy and anxious. Eventually with the risk of being very needy I confessed my feelings to her, told her how much I like her etc. she refused me by explaining to me that at that time she would not have felt comfortable having a relationship with me because she didn t want to hurt me. I called that a bullshit, kept stalking her for a few months, meanwhile I dropped out of college because I had missed so many classes due to what I used to call at that time: laziness.

So I went back home, in my local city, over the next months I noticed that I am no longer able to breathe normally. Basically I did not know but I had every physical symptom of anxiety. My parents were dissapointed that I dropped out of college, they paid for my rent and food in the capital so I felt really bad for that. They are living in another country so I stayed with my grandma in my local city. So winter-spring 2018, I used to play video-games, did not take showers, would meet up with friends once a week maybe, could not breathe, got angry because of that so the result was that I could not breathe at all. Same thing, different days, I was a mess. In this period of time, I used to stalk that girl, I was ashamed of myself, how can I be so needy, buthurt etc. She would text me once in a while to ask me what's up, at the beggining I was trying not to care and to show her that I do not care anymore but I would have ended up being even more needy...anyway nothing happened she would ghost me, I would get upset and the conversation was gone.

Deep pain from reading horror stories,"I used to consume horror stories all the time. They transfixed me perfectly, always delivering fascinating chills. There's a certain stunning beauty in the slow decay and destruction of things, and the terrors of the unknown as well. For me, horror became compulsive, as I would sometimes get an itch for a little mystery and terror. I believe my depression was developing more at the time, and it's already known that horror has an effect on people.

Whatever the case, I fell in love with *Marble Hornets*. Perhaps it's kind of trashy, but I  spent entire weeks devouring the series. It enticed me and terrified me. Soon enough though, something happened. Sometimes it was too much and I had to stop. And then all I could do was lay on the floor in terror. Within me rose a feeling, or sensation of a sort. For hours at a time I'd be laying on the floor, motionless, and terrified of things that I don't understand. Even now I don't know if I can explain it. It was cold, unspeakable, crushed my soul and wouldn't let me go.

I'll try to express a bit of how it felt in text.

Imagine a long-abandoned, filthy room with yellowed walls and grime in every corner. To the left lies an old metal bed frame, jagged and rusted, with no bedding. Behind there is a doorway. You thought you saw a dark hallway, but you can't bring yourself to look. There's a window, but it's much too dark to see anything. And then you see it - the lead pipe on the floor. You touch it, you stare at it. You can't move. You're terrified of it and you don't know why.

I think that expresses it pretty well. I'm sorry if it's campy. I'm bringing back painful things to make this.

I don't know how my internet horror habits did this much to me. This is the closest I've ever gotten to my mind just snapping. In a classical sense, I was going insane. The insanity was miserable and terrifying, but intoxicating.

I promised myself to avoid anything horror. This wasn't so difficult. In fact, I'm not sure I could've made myself find those things if I tried. Still though, I was fascinated and perplexed about why this happened. In time, I never got an answer but I learned that all you can really do is leave it behind. Dwelling on it only breeds itself.

It took time. But I generally continued to become a lot better, and completely forgot about the whole thing. Of course I've never stopped being fascinated by horror. Some things happen, but nothing the same as before. I try to keep boundaries. Just one good scare will linger with me for hours, so I scarcely go on a binge.

My recent interest in horror brought this back, and I'm realizing an important piece of the history of my depression that I overlooked because of other big things. I'm not sure if horror's good for me or anyone who has depression, but it's a unique and interesting genre. It's probably based on the depressed person in question.

My hearts empty , and I got nothing ,my parents love me but like I'm hollow from the inside 
Guess I was born with this curse 
I talked about my depression to my boss and he said I'm lucky to even be aware that I have a problem ,he said most people go through their entire lives without even realizing that they're depressed

Already put myself a date to leave this damn world,"I'm tired of struggling in life. 19 years old and life won to me. Congratulations, you won. I'm tired of fighting anymore. Moreover, I'm tired of losing everything, friends, interests...

Regarding the selfish aspect of depression,"I don't feel like the selfishness of depression gets talked about enough. It's not direct or intentional selfishness, but rather a by-product. I mean, you spend almost all day consumed with battling your own thoughts and feelings, often to the point where you become completely disconnected from the rest of the world, totally self-involved, but in the worst way. It causes you to forget things like birthdays, that concert that your friend really wanted you to go to, spacing out and counting all the reason your boss thinks you're a loser while Jan from accounting is gushing about her upcoming ski trip. 

And if you live with it long enough, maybe you watch it cripple your social skills and intellect because you're so consumed with existential dread, guilt and despair that you don't have enough mental capacity to pay attention to social cues or spend time being interested in learning about something other than why you're a failure.

Why do I feel like everyone’s fake and I’m the only one left who’s real,Every day I feel more and more isolated surrounded by social media constantly.

I wish there was an antidepressant like a painkiller.,"Like, something you can take for on-the-spot depression, you know? I've gotten to the point in my recovery where I've found a cocktail of meds that works for me, I'm generally pretty okay, and I don't feel like a danger to myself most of the time. But then there are moments like tonight.

I just can't shut up that inner voice telling me I'm an eternal fuck-up. The self-loathing is intense tonight. I know it's just because of some recent minor mistakes here and there, most of which objectively weren't my fault and with no harm done, but try telling my brain that. Maybe it's so bad because I'm upset I had to cancel a trip to visit my brother? Also could be hormones? I don't know anymore.

Anyway, I just wish there was an antidepressant I could take for moments like this. It's not like I can just take more of my meds when I feel worse, that's not how it works and it's a good way to end up in the hospital getting my stomach pumped or something. I don't know if/how something like that would work, but I just... I don't know. I'm falling into old thought patterns. ""Eternal fuck up."" ""I just want to get out."" Et cetera.

I need to get back into therapy. Time to stop procrastinating, calling my list of potential therapists in the morning. Just wanted to vent a little, I guess. Going to distract myself tonight. I know what I need to do, but these familiar thought patterns are so hard to get out of. Maybe because they're familiar? It's almost comfortable, in a way. The way a chair is comfortable and you don't want to get up, even though you're losing circulation to your legs, your butt's gone numb, and you can't find a decent way to position your arms anymore.

How to find out if I really have depression?,"Hi,

I am a 29 year old male. Since I was a kid i have always been obese. I had a really shitty childhood and I started to overeat as a coping mechanism. Until today I am struggling with that. I managed a few times to loose a lot of weight by eating healthier and moving more, but I never manage to keep that lifestyle. I always slip back in my old habits at some point.

In addition I have a real problem to motivate myself. I gradually lost all interest in my hobbies. It feels like nothing gives me pleasure anymore. On days i don't have to work i often don't do anything anymore.

I am also feeling completely alone. I don't have many friends because I moved a lot in the last 7 years. And the few friends I have i hardly ever see because I dont want to ruin their day by beeing a boring downer.
I also have been single for 6 years now and I still lack the confidence to date again. My former girlfriend left me for another guy she allready was dating before we broke up and it crushed me. Somehow  I can't get over it.

The only thing I have going for me is that I recently got promoted to be the leader of a team of 40 people. Some former coworkers talked me into applying for that position. But I feel like a failure and a fraud now that i have the job. Strangely i always get neutral or good feedback, despite not beeing statysfied with my own work.

For a long time I have been wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I feel stuck.

I feel like a failure because I am obese.
I am obese because i lack motivation.
I lack motivation because I see no positive future for me.
which in turn makes me overeat because that is how i learned to cope.

That is why i want to get help. But i don't know where to start. I don't have a doctor i trust. If I go to a random doctor they will tell me I need to loose weight. Which is true, but I need to get my mental health fixed for that to happen.

I know I sound like a f'in defeatist but I am really desperate

So after this long wall of text:
Does this sound like a depression to you?
Have any of you been in the same situation?
How can I start to get out of this cycle?

I want to help my spouse but have NO idea where to begin...,"Hi, I am brand new to this board and I’m hoping to get some genuine, helpful feedback. If this is not allowed, I sincerely apologize. Also, sorry about the length of this message.
My (f46) husband (m44) has been medically diagnosed with depression for 2 years now. I suspect he was depressed prior to that, but he self medicated with booze, heavily drank and now has cirrhosis. 2 years ago, he wound up in the hospital (that’s where we found out the cirrhosis) and without the alcohol, he felt the weight of everything. He was put on depression meds, a small dose initially. They bumped the dosage up after 6 or so months when he said he didn’t feel any different (I noticed a difference, especially when he would skip his medicine, but to be fair, it isn’t about what I notice and more about how he feels).
Fast forward a year - he picks up drinking again. He binges regularly because he can’t handle the depressed feeling. He has refused all counseling and says it doesn’t work for him. He was forced to go as a child and has hated the idea of psychiatry ever since. He went a few times for alcohol dependency and recovery, but he didn’t go regularly and just sort of quit at some point.
This past November, due to cutbacks, he was downsized and lost his job of 20 years. This had nothing to do with the drinking, but it caused him to binge harder and to become more and more depressed.
For 4 months he has been actively looking for a job and actively either been rejected or the salary didn’t match around what he was making before. He has slowly but steadily sunk deeper and deeper into a depressive state. A month ago and he doctor changed his prescriptions to a mixture of depression meds, but he hates how the new one makes him feel. He was binging off and on and doesn’t always take his medicine regularly, which of course does zero to help him fight his depression.
I never hear him laugh anymore. He sleeps all day. He barely wakes up to use the bathroom. Over the course of the past 4 days, he only got out of bed to go get vodka (Saturday), and to take the kids to school one morning (Monday). Other than that, he has slept the entire time. As much as 23 hours a day. He won’t get out of bed. He doesn’t text me anymore; won’t even talk to me really. Very minimal effort if any at all. He feels useless and I can see the depression taking hold of him more and more.
So how can I best help him? What did you find helpful or comforting when you were sinking and just wanted to end it all? I just started keeping his pills in a pillbox so on the days that I notice they haven’t been taken, I wake him and beg him to take them until I see him swallow them down. I hate doing this, but I hate seeing him suffer more. Any advice? I’ve never suffered from depression or anxiety and I’m not sure best how I can help him, or if I should even bother. I don’t want to cause him to sink further, this is so hard.

I don’t want to cause him to sink further, this is so hard.
Thank you if you read this far down and thank you in advance for any help you can throw my way."

I feel guilty and I don't know why,"I've been feeling crappy today. I was at my boyfriends for a good chunk of the afternoon and all I wanted to was sleep. I got upset for literally no reason and started crying. 

He was trying so hard to make me laugh and smile and I was having such a hard time getting out of this funk. I eventually calmed myself down and we finally laughed and had good rest of the afternoon. 

I just can't get rid of this overwhelming feeling that I don't deserve him. I usually don't feel like this so I don't know why I do today. He just tried so much to make me feel better and it just made me realize how amazing of a guy I have. I'm just feeling overwhelmed by how caring he is to me and how much I feel like I don't deserve him.

I'm literally sitting crying about it and I don't know how to get over these feelings. I feel undeserving of my boyfriend and my wonderful family I have.

I am very depressed in college,"I go to a BIG university. It’s one of those college towns, where besides the college, the rest of the town is very dull. The majority of people live within walking distance or maybe a 5 minute drive. I’m a sophomore and my mom decided to buy a house to save money from dorms and rent and she can sell it after we graduate. The house is 20 minutes away in traffic. But I feel like I am missing out SO much on the college experience. She didn’t want me in the dorms and I have made no friends.

Having trouble adjusting to a normal sleep schedule,"
Ever since I was 13 my sleep schedule has been upside down. It messed with my alertness in school. I’d go to sleep at 3 am on average, and I’d have to wake up by 7 am to get to school. I’d often sleep through my classes which resulted in me eventually dropping out of middle school. I did end up going back and finishing it the next year though. 

I’m 19 now, I still struggle from this backwards schedule. I sleep at 6am-2pm. That’s the schedule that seems to do it for me. I wake up fully rested and I feel awake and alert. I’ve tried resetting the schedule several times. In fact I did it yesterday. I slept at 9pm and woke up at 6am. Fairly normal right? When I woke up my entire body felt like rusty tin. All my joints hurt and my eyes felt sandy. I still feel weak and it’s only 11am. I tried walking outside and getting sun, I tried eating, I tried showering but I just feel so unbelievably lethargic and bad. I feel like I need slept at all. Everything hurts.

I’m not sure what to do about this. I know what my body likes I know that sleeping the way I usually do seems to work for me but it’s really problematic. I lost my first job because I woke up too late, I also had to drop out of high school and half the night that I am up there’s nothing g left to do and I’m all alone. I experience depression and anxiety as well if that matters.",t2_5hsqzc0c,3,0,1,"Having trouble adjusting to a normal sleep schedule

Today has been such a hard day for me I had two meltdowns,I did not get any sleep last night so I emailed my therapist asking her what to do if I needed to cancel going to group tonight. I then decided to take off of work so I could rest to go to the group and then she emailed me saying she canceled it. I was so upset that I took off for work for nothing and ruined my day. Then I got an email from my job and my hours are being cut.  Right when I was saying I need more structure and routine. This has been such a terrible day for me. Now I’m so upset that I won’t be able to buy the video game I’ve been waiting months for that means everything to me. 😢,t2_3y9abuhb,0,0,1,Today has been such a hard day for me I had two meltdowns I did not get any sleep last night so I emailed my therapist asking her what to do if I needed to cancel going to group tonight.

Venlafaxine and Blood Pressure?,"So, I was sick a few weeks ago and made a trip to the doctor. When they took my blood pressure, the doctor remarked it was a bit high. This concerned me, so I've been monitoring it at home since then. It is pretty consistently 137/97.


 Now, my diet and exercise routine are far from great. However, this still seems pretty high for my current lifestyle. I know some antidepressants can increase blood pressure. I currently take venlafaxine (150 mg). Has anyone experienced an increase I'm blood pressure on this medication? 


Part of me is just looking for some excuses so I can stop worrying about this as much as I am, but I am also just genuinely curious. I dont have any recordings from before I took this medication, so I unfortunately cannot compare. I do have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and my primary care doctor next week, so I am not seeking any medical advice. Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.

Improvement,"I’ve suffered from depression from early highschool that was triggered by social anxiety, loneliness, and other factors that involve my family and environmental stress. I had a downward spiral in late college due to a breakup and attempted/contemplated suicide. I failed multiple times to kill myself by plugging my exhaust pipe of my car (the cloth kept coming off even with duct tape) and attempted hanging myself in my dorm but was scared of what the afterlife may bring, even though I’m agnostic. After class, I made a post on FaceBook about how everything seemed meaningless and stopped contact with family that became concerned. They got worried and my half sister that was in my college town ended up finding me, and at that point my mental stability began to crash and I didn’t even know who I was anymore. She kept talking about how if I keep it up I’ll have to be put in a hospital and be monitored and put on medications, which only made me lose my mind even more. It took awhile to recover, and living with my agressive and verbally abusive brother didnt help with that. He said in one of our biggest fights that I should’ve killed myself. After time went on, I began to regain a positive self image, coped with being alone, and began to realize that I have people around me that love and care about me. I made so many close friends at work, have a better relationship with my brother, and found out a good friend of mine from college likes me. I’m now starting vet school this fall and have a more positive outlook on life and my future. Just know that you guys have the strength to fight depression, and it may take some time or a defining moment for the realization to occur.

"A glimpse into my existence, notice I don’t say life.. because I’m not living.","I’m a (25F) who has been battling depression for as long as I can remember. Only did I get professional help within the past year. I see a therapist twice a week and a psychiatrist once a month. For a whole year now. I can honestly say I’m only getting worse. Especially within the past 3 years. I’ve tried all the grounding techniques and breathing exercises, and 7 types of medications. Nothing is working and I’m only putting more and more financial strain on my dad. He supports me financially when it comes to medical bills, and oh do I feel so guilty about that. He is the only parent who works due to my mom having a heart condition. As you guessed i still live under their roof because I can’t hold a job long enough to support myself. I was clinically diagnosed with depression and GAD, and I’m sure that’s just the tip of it. I don’t understand my emotions and due to the depression causing memory loss and brain fog that doesn’t allow me to comprehend or configure sentences to express my issues to my doctors. I have nothing to my name. No car, no job, no nothing. I have a loving boyfriend of 6 years who has supported me as much as he can throughout all of this. A lot of the times he doesn’t know what to do or say, and I remind him I don’t blame him. Nothing in this world could make me feel any differently. Everyday I wake up I sigh, here we go again. I sleep majority of the days away. I’m talking 15-
18 hours I’m asleep. I can only stay awake for up to 3 hours max before dozing off needing a nap. My mind runs constantly about this and that and all of the above to the point I exhaust myself. There is nothing more I want at this point than to not be alive. I just don’t want to do it anymore. I pray for death. I pray every-time I leave my house I die in a car accident, a stray bullet, a fire, anything. I get jealous when I hear on the news someone has passed. I wish it were me. Now there is this new coronavirus spreading and everyone is freaking out, sweeping stores of canned goods, water and necessities. While I pray I come in contact with someone who is infected. I have a very loving family. Two loving parents, an older sister (who pushed me to address my mental health) and a younger brother who has a big heart. I could never commit suicide, because we’re all that we have. No other family ties. We all live together, and always have so were very very close. I think about it every day though. Hanging myself from the tree out back. Taking every single pill I have and can find through out the house. Feeding a tube from the exhaust pipe of the car through my window into my closet with me in it. Driving into oncoming traffic. Hell, I even saw in a movie a guy wrapped a rope around his neck, through his back window of the car and around a tree and hit the gas. I’ve thought about blowing my brains out. But all of this is gruesome and would mentally fuck anyone who heard their loved one passed in such a way. I can’t do that to them. But how is that fair to me, that I live such a miserable life just for the sake of those around me? I juggle those two.. do I finally do something that I want, or keep pleasing those around me? My parents know I have depression and anxiety but who really knows what that means unless you are going through it. I know they don’t understand and are uncomfortable with the thought of it so it’s just an “here is the money for your thing” type thing. I never really have gone into detail about any of this because I don’t want them to think they failed me. I had a very good childhood. No incidences. I was a very anxious kid but because of that it pushed me to do what I was told and get good grades. I always wonder why I have depression and anxiety. I was never molested, abused, or bullied more than the average kid. I haven’t gone through anything traumatic, or anything more than the average heartbreak from a high-school sweetheart. I do have to admit, he did abused me, emotionally, mentally, verbally, and somewhat physically. But I’ve felt this way even before him. I could go on and on about my involuntary existence, but the real reason I’m typing this right now is because I had to do something to get my mind off taking all of my pills at once. Yesterday I poured them all in my cupped hands and it looked like enough to do the job, and since then, I cannot get that picture out of my head. I do think I should admit myself into a mental institution, but you know what that means.. more money from dad.. way way way more money. And I just can’t take from him anymore. He has the rest of us to support. So what’ll I’ll do tonight? I’ll try to sleep.. wake up and sigh, rinse, and repeat. If you’ve made it this far, I appreciate that. Because no one. And I mean no one, has gotten this much raw emotion from me. Hell, I might just share this with my loved ones to give an insight of how far from ok I really am.

What should I do?,"Hello everyone. I’m Deniz, Male, 18 years old from Germany. It’s just I don’t know what to do. I think I need help. I tried to talk to my mother many times but she always says “it’s just a phase you don’t even know what real problems are”
Well I’m keep saying myself that she’s right, it’s just a phase but I don’t know. I want to know your opinions too. There’s this feeling, this emptiness inside me.

I think I experienced trauma as a kid and I don't know what to do,"I don't even understand my own thoughts.

I think a couple years back when i was 12-13, my aunt tried to sexually assault me.
We were in a parking lot, and she was walking behind me laughing. And she ran up to me in public and started rubbing against me behind my back. My memory is very fuzzy but I remember saying ""Stop."" and ran forward ahead of her.

Instantly that moment I was uncomfortable, and I tried to avoid her that entire trip.
I told her I wanted to go home, and that's when I was terrified.
I'm pretty sure she was drunk by the way she drove and her breath.
Once I got home she kept asking over and over if I wanted to go to the store with her which I in return kept firmly saying no.

After that our relationship crumbled, I kept rejecting her asks to hang out with me and I hated her.
I have told nobody.

I am terrified because I don't even know if I was sexually abused.
I am terrified because I can't even trust my own thoughts.
If I tell anyone my entire family will become more fucked up then it is.

"Numb and career success, relationships and alcohol have all failed to medicate it","I’ve always been a bit of an emotionally numb person, even as a child I struggled to find things I enjoyed. 

As I grew older I’ve tried a whole range of things to spark some kind of positive emotion, whether that’s trying sports, hobbies, socialising or other interests and nothing has ever made me truly happy.

The only reason I even know what I feel is abnormal is because a few things were able to make me feel some spark inside me, usually whenever I had some sort of large success such as finding a girlfriend, a new job or buying a home. But otherwise, it’s just emotional white noise.

At risk of sounding as though I’m trying to boast, I am in my early twenties and have achieved these things, I’m in a senior position at a large company, yet I feel either numb or miserable all the time and not all like I am successful. None of it was ambition, just desperation to achieve to feel something good for once.

Then I turned to alcohol, which is still the only thing that can consistently give me some positive buzz, but I quickly needed more and more and I’m worried how this will go.

I used to be depressed about being single, but now having a girlfriend has not actually impacted my mood at all, I briefly enjoyed the emotional and physical sides of it but this too I quickly built ‘tolerance’ to.

I’ve tried therapy and numerous antidepressants but none of it would make my problem go away.

What’s wrong with me? All my life only big successes could make me happy, it’s like the threshold for what I need to get a tiny dose of happiness is extremely high and it drives me insane.

Life's spiralling downwards,"Please ignore the typos :(

I fucking hate this so much. I'm tired of waking up everyday. I have my final exams going on and have my math paper tomorrow, but there's so much on my mind that I can't study. I'm gonna end up scoring really bad. 

I'm tired of my bf acting like he's the savior I've been needing. His name means happiness so he thinks he can make me happy. All he's ever done is make me sad and feel less of a person. He makes me feel like I'm a 'broken' person who needs 'fixing' because of bad past experiences. He keeps telling me ""I'm your happiness"". I get that he's trying to help me but it doesn't work. I've told him plenty of times but he just wouldn't stop. I feel like I'm just a depressed person not a person with depression. If that's all I am then I just want to die. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and see him there. I feel bad because he's really nice sometimes.

I was raised in a conservative home so naturally I'm a conservative and yeah idm it. He knows this. It's only been 3 months to our relationship and he said he wants to make out with both of us ""shirtless"". I'm sorry if I'm being a prude here but I'm not comfortable. I'm just not comfortable. I told him no repeatedly but he kept pushing the idea onto me, I told him in not comfortable and that it's escalating too quickly. This happened last night. I'm probably overeating but I'm hurt because when you trust someone but they ignore your consent, it's kinda scary. I feel so fucking weak. Every sexual abuse victim is so fucking strong. Ik this is absolutely nothing compared to what they've been through but idky I just feel unheard. I told him no eight times before he finally heard me. I'm sorry I'm just generally uncomfortable with people. 

Today, he's just behaving as if nothing happened. I told him about last night and how uncomfortable it made me feel but he just said ""you're overthinking"". I feel bad because I can't give him what he wants but I'm sorry, I'm so fucking sorry I'm not comfortable. This has had such a negative effect on my psyche. I was super stressed about the exams and now I have this pretty insignificant incident just looming over my head. 

My family problems keep getting worse. My grandma is a fucking bitch who has done nothing but destroy my home. (My paternal gm lives with us because she can't sustain herself.) My mom wants a divorce but the only reason she's not getting it is because I'm still a high school student and I don't wanna be stuck between a custody battle. I really wish I could just kill myself so my mom could finally leave this hell of a home. My dad's really attached to his mother and he won't say anything against my gm. 

My elder who is studying in another state said I would never be successful. That kinda hurt. When I told my 'bff' I was suicidal, she just said ""can you not"". That was unexpected, she didn't apologise. After 5 months or so she said ""I should've been nicer to Dan. Oh you too"". OH YOU TOO, THAT'S ALL? I lose my only emotional support back then and that's all she had to say. That was around the time I met my bf so ig that's why he sees me as someone who needs constant support. He keeps saying ""I'm here and I'll make you happy"". I just feel super unconscious now. I'm sorry, I'm probably overeating but I don't want to fucking wake up tomorrow. 

I really want to kill myself. I recently moved back to self harm again. Self harm, weed and wine seem to be the only things that comfort me these days.

How do I forgive myself.,"so  

i've been smoking weed for 2 years straight. Started in 11th grade, and im now 19. this has caused me to pretty much completely lose my memory from my childhood. 

I started smoking (probably) due to my porn addiction which was slowly rotting my brain for the majority of my life (found porn at very young like 5). I was always stimulating myself with video games and porn growing up, so when I discovered weed it had this magical attribute to it that made me feel like ME.

So through smoking, I helped ""cure"" myself so that I could live my life happily but secretly I was still indulging in porn. I was still sabotaging my spirit. The porn escalated to showing my privates live on cam sites (idk why, it actually scared me to do this) for the thrill that I'm exchanging a sexual act with someone else.

I got addicted to this for some reason and just started jerking off with men. Note, I believe that I am straight and am just into the exhibition side of this addiction, which was another mental war I had with myself. I could never imagine a genuine relationship with another man.   

I've smoked an unreal amount of weed for my age. Over an oz a week at times. This led me to be completely broke, even though I've had 6 temporary jobs throughout my highschool career. I should have around $30k+ total if I completely saved, but I'm typing this with $0.  This has also resulted in absolutely zero motivation to do anything with my time besides play videogames and escape.

Recently, I have been taking psychedelics (mushrooms) and long story short I believe I am re-aligned with my spiritual self, except I am broken from all the bullshit I've done. By killing my spirit through addiction I have pushed all of my friends away, am disconnected more than ever from my family, and my girlfriend broke up with me. I show no motivation and clearly don't care anymore. My family wants to help but only after I reached out.

Cannabis Use Disorder / Possible Driver Licence Suspension,"Feeling really stressed, confused, and angry right now.

Just got out of my appointment with my psychiatrist and he said I may be dealing with depression, anxiety, and addiction. I told him during a depressive episode a few month ago i had intrusive thoughts while driving. My head was full of suicidal thoughts then and I felt an urge to ram into the opposite lane, but of course did not act on those thoughts. We have been meeting for a while now and has urged me to cut my cannabis use down. I vape multiple times a day and its definitely a “problem”. 

For the past 2 weeks i have been not sleeping or eating well/regularly. Using a lot of cannabis and drinking a lot caffeine in an attempt to get my schoolwork deadlines on time. I am late for 6 projects and was so stressed out last week I didn’t take my meds and was a very chaotic time. I am still working on getting my assignments in and pass my school but today during our appointment he said that he has to report that I am a substance abuser to the government and the ministry may suspend my licence to drive. I know he is support to help me but I feel like I am being stabbed in the back and is giving my life a lot of inconveniences at a really stressful time. He said its his legal obligation and that it is a wake up call for me but idk i feel really scared of it leaving a record on my licence, increasing insurance or my family finding out that my licence is suspended cause of cannabis abuse. No i never drive under the influence, i barely drive and don’t own a car atm just driving my family when i visit them

I’m going to eat something its already 3pm, 9 hours left to get on my work. Idk, weed helps me feel better in the short term but he said it drains my energy and my saps my creativity. I have a hard time stopping using and my use increases significantly in times of stress.

Does depression always feel the same?,"I've had depression in the past, and that included self harm, not wanting to do anything, alienating myself from all of my friends and family, and genuinely just not caring about myself or anything i do.

Flash forward to now and i don't necessarily feel *that bad.* I feel down and alone often, but it doesn't ""*hurt*"" like it did before.  I haven't seriously considered self harming, but i do always feel tired and it takes a lot for me to finally decide i want to do something. I actually just canceled my vacation i already paid for and was supposed to go on yesterday because i started feeling super anxious over it. Sometimes i do just think about running away and not telling anyone so i can be alone, but then i realize that i'll just be alone in a different place.

I just need support.,"I think I might have lost another friend to suicide but I can't verify as they were an online friend. I've been struggling too and really need a pick me up. I'm falling in a spiral.

I'm in love with a girl who said she really liked me, we dated for a week or two but now she's questioning her sexuality and ""we're just friends again"" even though one of us desperately wants to be more.

I love her and I don't know what to do as I really want to support her and if she likes guys I want to be her first pick. 

I love her. I can't get over her or stop thinking about her. All because there's a stupid slim possibility I can still have her. She's questioning her sexuality, which is cool and all, but it means I can't have her.

We're still friends. Which is great but also mind numbing hard. I try to be strong around her and show her that I can be what she needs if she likes guys. I just want to be able to love her instead of having to hide it. 

She's perfect. I love everything about her. I can't do this anymore. I've felt so depressed recently that my grades have plummeted. Its been like this before, but this time I've started self harming too. On my thighs, so nobody can see. I'm in therapy and on meds. They help a lot but sometimes its just too much. I'm so stressed. She's not the main source of the problem, my brain is.

But having her love me sure would make things easier...I was happy with her. Happier then I had been in months...

I love her. I can't get over her or stop thinking about her. All because there's a stupid slim possibility I can still have her. She's questioning her sexuality, which is cool and all, but it means I can't have her.

We're still friends. Which is great but also mind numbing hard. I try to be strong around her and show her that I can be what she needs if she likes guys. I just want to be able to love her instead of having to hide it. 

She's perfect. I love everything about her. I can't do this anymore. I've felt so depressed recently that my grades have plummeted. Its been like this before, but this time I've started self harming too. On my thighs, so nobody can see. I'm in therapy and on meds. They help a lot but sometimes its just too much. I'm so stressed. She's not the main source of the problem, my brain is.

But having her love me sure would make things easier...I was happy with her. Happier then I had been in months...

I haven't been happy in weeks and have self harmed. I'm preoccupying myself with hobbies and things to keep me busy but I really need help right now. I'm already on meds and in counseling, but I just need more support rn."

I got it planned out,"So I’m putting this here because I’ve honestly thought about it and want peoples opinions

So little back story here

I have been dealing with depression my entire life and my life has been crappy. I recognize that others have it worse and I feel for them. Anyway, I have ptsd, big polar depression, anxiety, and borderline psychotic (I was told that but idk if it actually exists) 

I’ve also been molested and used my entire life and my dad told me when I was 5 that I ruined his life and he wants nothing to do with me anymore and then left. My mom resents me for that and my brother and sister also resent me due to the fact my mom cheated on their dad with my dad and I’m hated for that. 

During school I was bullied everyday and came home with black eyes as well as bruises on my body while my mom would drink and never let me in or gave me a chance to talk to her. I also got into a relationship where I was cheated on constantly and used as well as used to get a kid (she poked holes and stopped the birth control. But she and I live with each other because I want to be there for him and not pay child support and see my son , yes he is mine surprisingly, instead of half my check going and I see my son once a month. 

Before I say my plan I just want to say it may sound selfish but at this point in life i am done and my son deserves better. Oh i also had to drop out of college after working 2 full time jobs and taking care of my son while doing 5 classes because his mom doesn’t want to work or really anything aside from he at home and it was either quit my jobs and finish my degree and struggle for 3 more years and possibly get a job and lose my apartment car etc. or leave college and make money to support my son now.

Into the plan

So I’m 21 and just found out today I was fired from my job that I’ve been at for 6 months and put so much time in. I would work 120 hours and only get paid for half but stuck with it because it was the only source of income. Also found out I can’t go back to school because I owe my school student loans now (I planned on going back this next year but now that’s not possible) along with ball of this my depression is getting worse (I have tried to go to a therapist but I missed 2 appointments because of my job and was almost fired for it and yes I did schedule the days off but being a manager I couldn’t say no to call ins or anything without losing my job.)

So I’m broke, can’t get mental help, I’m not allowed to really go out and find an outlet because my sons mom makes me feel guilty and i feel tied down to my apartment because my son is fragile and I feel I can’t leave to work out walk or anything outside of my place. I can’t do a lot inside my apartment but I have a small place (3 suv sizes) and my son wants to play and interrupts every time I try to work out write or do something I enjoy. I don’t mind it it’s actually kind of cute but you could see how it could get annoying. 

Anyway here’s my plan forgive me if it sounds selfish.

Im thinking on killing myself NOT NOW OR SOON BUT IN 6 or 10 years. 

I plan on making enough money to pay my debts off, get money for my son to go to school and be taken care of as well as have enough money to pay his tuition and college.  Also be able to get a house and pay it off and leaving it to my son and his mom as well as make sure they’re both fully taken care of without me. 

After I have erased my debts and made enough money for my son to go to college and have a house to live in. I also plan on getting cremated and having myself turn into a necklace or some type of jewelry or anything for my son to keep. As well as make sure my family has nothing to pay for when I’m gone.

I’m gonna buy a old junk car and make sure it’s faulty and make my death look like a car accident so my son won’t feel guilty. 

This has just been a fantasy and might make it happen if it gets worse. But I’ve been planning this for the last few years.

TLDR:

I have a lot of mental problems and can’t go to a therapist for another year, was screwed my entire life so far and was used to have a kid that I wouldn’t know was mine for a year. Was cheated on by a girl I loved and still do  but continuously getting screwed. Dad left when I was 5 and was told it was because of me and my mom as well as brother and sister resent me.

"Chronic Loneliness, need advice [28m]","I have tons of thoughts about my situation, but I’m going to try and explain everything as clearly as possible.

I got out of a pretty destructive long term relationship almost a year ago, that ended purely because my ex being bi-polar and unmedicated. I did my best to stay positive, got my own apartment, promotion at work, lost 50lbs and really tried hard to maintain a positive outlook.

Along with this though, became me being cut off from her friend group and family as well. I have a very tight nit group of friends that have unfortunately all moved far away. We keep in contact and plan trips, but I rarely see them.

Fast forward 4 months, I fall into a depression and MAJOR ocd episode that I am just now getting out of thanks to my own efforts and therapy. It was pure fucking hell to do alone and I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy.

I try to be social. I make a point of hanging out with coworkers at least 1-2 times a week, I go to weekly social events and try my best to hang with friends on the weekends.

My issues is, I cannot maintain new friendships nor do I get invited to events really unless I’m the one planning them and even then people are hella flakey. I have social anxiety and small talk is hard but I try my best and sometimes do okay.

I am not connecting with anyone on a deeper level and it is driving me into another depression and I’m legitimately scared. I’ve gotten dates with online apps but it feels like tons of effort and usually just fails before a date even happens because of my social anxiety. On top of this, living alone is adding pressure as I have no one to vent to or just talk with at the end of the day.

I need advice, I’m in therapy but constantly talking about this is not helping the situation actually get fixed (as I am and have been maintaining constant efforts to fix this).

Could my depression get worse if I stop taking meds for two weeks?,"Last month my psychiatrist gave me two perscriptions so I won't run out of my pills because she's now unavailable for the next two weeks and I can't have an appointment. But I didn't realize I had only a month to buy the meds anyway and now the perscription is outdated. I know I screwed that myself, but I just noticed yesterday that I don't have almost anything left. 

I only take this meds (50mg sertraline) for two months and it started to work but the results are not the best yet. But I worry that if I will stop now they will be gone and I'd feel even worse, not to mention I will have to get used to it again. I have only one pill left and I could split it in half and take it every other day but that's it. Also I don't want to go to another doctor since they don't know my situation and doctors in the clinic that I go to aren't also available for the next 10 days, so I don't think that makes any difference.

 I also take pregabalin for anxiety and I ran out of it too but it's something that only works when I take it and not a long term like sertraline. Even though it's going to be difficult for me without it.

i’ve gone through all of the hardest things one could go through over the last year and there is STILL nobody here for me,"i’m not going through pain for attention, or validation. i don’t want to be in pain. i don’t want to feel empty. 

but it’s scary knowing that at from age 17-18:

-i starved myself down to 89 lbs
-attempted suicide
-was hospitalized multiple times
-ruined a 3+ year relationship with my boyfriend
-had to somehow finish and graduate high school
-was forced to move from my hometown that i lived in for 18 years
-my separated parents both moved into new houses with their new spouses
-i withdrew my college applications and didn’t go to school in the fall
-my grandmother died of cancer in december 

i’ve been on the edge of insanity for a year and nobody seems to even try to be there for me, it feels like nobody cares that much, nobody wants to do anything about how i feel or ask me how i am even though they know i’m hurting and i’ve asked for help so many times. 

my parents don’t want to be responsible for me anymore, i’m legally an adult now, when i attempted suicide it was a burden to them, my mom yelled at me. “how could i bring this hurt into her life?” 

is it normal for people to not care despite going through this many things at such a young age and in such a short period of time? i don’t know what’s normal anymore, I’ve started expecting less and less of others because i always get let down. i just don’t know if i can go through life this way",t2_3lbmn7pi,1,0,1,"i’ve gone through all of the hardest things one could go through over the last year and there is STILL nobody here for me i’m not going through pain for attention, or validation. i don’t want to be in pain. i don’t want to feel empty.

Can depression lead to cognitive issues?,"Hey all. I'm vastly sick right now (hopefully not COVID-19) so I might be typing a little incoherently... but since I have 2 weeks off, I need y'alls help! I'm not sure if this belongs here but it relates more to mental health/depression than school, but let me know if it doesn't. I'll gladly direct it to the right subreddit. 

OK. I know depression a lot because it's been a \*\*\*\* in my life, but I also don't know a lot. My friend has depression along with PTSD, but she's in a much better state thanks to years of therapy. She's practically in a better state than me because she's highly functional, social, living well, can seek and find joy, etc. However, I've noticed something really weird. We're both in the same college. She's smart. When I talk to her, gosh, she can paint a story and explain herself better than I can (and people think I'm brilliant at it). She doesn't know what anxiety is when talking to me or other people. But the odd thing is that... we shared a class last semester, and she was accused of plagiarism. I don't know what went down but since she got an F on the final and an A- in the whole class, I didn't make a big deal out of it. But she got accused of plagiarism AGAIN today. We only started talking more the past few weeks so I don't know her too well but I got all of her assignments and read through them. Half of them got good grades... the other half were accused of plagiarism. The professor, chair, and a few other professors are highly against her. I read their email. There's nothing pointing at plagiarism, at least from my little knowledge. Her writing style is the same throughout 10+ assignments. She paraphrases and cites wherever she could. These aren't analytical papers either; they're just summaries of what she had to read. OK. So I'm not seeing it but maybe there is an issue. The professor specifically said she plagiarized OFF other students. I once shared an assignment with her and I def. noticed she somewhat copied my assignment (same examples, same points). But the really odd thing is that just last week, she was telling me how someone else was copying her paper word for word, she told the girl to stop, the girl didn't, she flipped out, and got her paper back. A bunch of students saw the fight. She told the professor what happened. 

OK so. Is it possible that she plagiarizes without knowing it? Is there some kind of cognitive dissonance/dysfunction related to depression/PTSD? I do not doubt her in character. She's sweet, smart, and jesus christ, the only person who can talk to me, be empathetic, understand me. Everything. But I do wonder if she's plagiarizing without knowing. I haven't asked her because I'm suspecting she does not have a clue she's plagiarizing. If she can point it out to others, but can't see it in herself... that sounds like some kind of psychological issue that I do not know of. The event has also triggered her depression so I told her to not think about it for the rest of the week. The only reason why I'm offering help to her is because I see vast potential. One talk with her proves she's really smart and has had her obstacles, but damn has she overcome them! I also know the professor who gave her the F last semester, the chair, and a few other professors. I can sort this out because they know me and my character well. I also just want to say, it might sound like I'm invasive but I truly care. She said she'll let me figure it out too. I've suffered in the hands of injustice in my school, and I don't want anyone else to suffer the same way. 

I dare not post this in more school-related subreddits because I know they'll trash me. ""Plagiarism is plagiarism."" I can give 1,000 examples of how crazy life can be and how much control we could NOT have over ourselves, our minds, and our brains. I've had my own experiences with some things that are outright wrong but no one ever blamed me because they know what happened! I'm only posting this here because I know the contributors are much more understanding and open-minded!

Getting Older with No Relationship Experience,"So I'm a 27 male, average build, decent looking. I'm mainly depressed because I'm heading towards 30 with a handful of crappy Tinder flings. I've never had a girlfriend, and it's making me concerned that I might actually die alone.

I have only used dating apps so far and I'm sick of them. I have gone out with around 20 women over the last 3 years, but I have never had a second date even though the first dates always end with them saying they had a good time. I have only seen the girl again if we had sex on the first date, otherwise I just get ghosted.

I just feel like I will never ""figure it out"" when it comes to flirting or dating. I have a harder time warming up to people due to a lot of negative family in my life that I cut out, but taking things slower doesn't seem to be accepted in modern dating, it's fast and furious.

I'm also not saying I can't talk to people. I actually was promoted to a supervisor position recently. My social circle is basically people I work with and we go out sometimes and joke around a lot.

I have tried going to nightclubs, Meetups, and so on, and have attempted asking a girl out on a few occasions, but I'm not sure how to go about it on a regular basis.

Depression related absences,"TW: Self-harm, Suicide 

Sooo yeah every semester it’s the same shit. I use up all of my free absences and occasionally go over one or two. But this semester has been extremely tough on me and my mental health. I even came really close to suicide yesterday and self-harmed pretty bad. On top of that, my insomnia has been at its absolute worst and between school and work, I’m just not sleeping. 

I have one professor who allows us 4 absences and I’ve only used 3 there. Two that allow us two absences and I’ve used both + 1. And my 4th professor who only allows us 1 and I’ve used 3... 

1 absence for a class that meets twice a week is simply ridiculous to me. So far she hasn’t dropped me from her class but I’m afraid she’ll fail me at the end of the semester without warning. I emailed her but she hasn’t replied. I’m honestly really scared and anxious because an F will ruin my GPA which I’ve worked EXTREMELY hard to maintain. 

I’d talk to my psychiatrist but because of school and work, I completely bailed on her and stopped taking my meds (they made me extremely suicidal). I’m scared that if I go back to her, asking for a medical excuse, that she’ll refuse because I haven’t been to see her. I really don’t know what to do.

Despite the absences, I’m doing really well in my classes and have good grades. So my professors can’t complain there. I always turn my work in on time and do everything I’m supposed to.",t2_zjk3t,1,0,1,"Depression related absences TW: Self-harm, Suicide

my roommate is depressed and i dont know how to help,"let me preface this my saying im bipolar (diagnosed). i know depression, ive spent days in bed and called in bc i cant find the will to even dress myself. but even with my knowledge, i dont know how to help my roommate/best friend

hes gone through a lot of stress these past couple of months - an emergency has left him with a lot of medical debt, hes having relationship issues, and now his wisdom tooth growing in has gotten infected and he needs oral surgery, which will leave him with even more debt. i understand why he would be depressed

he used to hang with me in the common area most of the time, but now he just stays in his room. he drinks a lot (like a lot). today i got him to open up a little and he says he wouldnt blame his gf is she was cheating on him bc hes 'a piece of shit'

in the 2 years ive lived with him, ive never seen him this bad. hes cried more in the past week than ive seen in the entire time ive known him. ive tried to use my own experience to talk with him, but he seems convinced that even showing me emotions is a sign that hes weak. he also told me that he had been counting on him not being alive past 30 (hes 35 now)

i mentioned the idea of talking to a therapist, and he gave a noncommittal answer, but im sure it meant he had no intention of talking to anyone

im worried.  ive never seen him like this. hes talking like i was talking during my Bad Days. i have a psych i can talk to, but i guess he only has me

what do i do? what can i say to help, or to convince him to see someone? im so worried and scared, hes my closest friend and i hate to see him like this

I felt something scary,"TRIGGER WARNING

I was just sitting there reminiscing and listening to some old music from my childhood, and then I felt something. It wasn't nostalgia, I know that feeling all too well. I can't describe it, but it's beautiful and makes me want to kill myself. Not to escape my pain or anything. I feel genuinely drawn to death. It sounds weird and edgy and it's scaring me that I feel this way. I've always kind of fetishised the idea of dying/taking one's own life, but this was me feeling compelled to do it on a visceral level.

26 year old male at the biggest transition of my life and struggling mentally and with injuries. Life story type post,"This is a long and poorly organized sort of semi story of my life. I am doing a lot of reflecting and soul searching and I just feel like typing this out. I've never shared anything like this before or put these things in detail for myself. It isn't all bad stuff, more extreme struggle at the moment and attempting to put the good and bad into perspective I have a lot going on in my life and thought I would roughly share my story. I am at the biggest transition in my life and am struggling,  I did not think it would turn out this way. I'm a 26 year old male. I have a middle class family. My parents are both in their late 60s. My mom is overall a great parent. My dad doesn't deserve the title in any capacity and has the mentality of a child. Mom despises him and there is no reason they should be together but I guess it's just simpler that way. I have one brother who is 35 and has a pretty good job as support in the tech industry.

I had social anxiety from very early on. In preschool I would hide behind a tree at recess everyday and I'd cry when we had to sing songs. My extreme fascination/obsession with girls started in elementary school. I remember crying over crushes I knew I would never have; girls that at the most I would have the courage to say hi to once or twice but always build it up in my head. In middle school I had extremely strong feelings of wanting to be a girl and feeling like it just fit my personality much better (still have some of that lingering). I had my first kiss in middle school and I had quite a handful of kisses in high school. In fact, for all my anxiety and lack of trying, I had a good handful of pretty attractive women, and a few very attractive ones offer a sexual relationship with me. At the time I couldn't go through with it. I wanted it, but I was afraid of everything to go along with it.  Idk if it's because I didn't have any strong conversations with a dad or something but I just wasn't making the most of things. I had my first date and talk ever with an attractive woman a few months ago, we weren't compatible but it was nice to get experience. It is hard to unravel what my extreme hold up to giving myself a fair shot in relationships is, but it feels like I am so in incredible awe of the attractive female form that my immediate reaction is always that they would never want me. There is literally nothing I want more and I feel like I don't bring anything to the table for them.

All of this said I have had consistent passions in my life that got me this far. I have had A LOT of enjoyment, fun, and excitement in my life; or at least my fair share by far considering I haven't put in much hard work. Music has been a passion of mine since early high school. I did the guitar classes and performances, played in rallies, and got some minor recognition for that. I got a degree in music at the community college. I had piano lessons as a kid and was able to expand on that some. I began teaching guitar, piano, and ukulele privately and that went on for a few years. I got up to about 15 students per week. I have also written a handful of reviews on a music rating website.

I also love soccer. I have been a youth soccer referee doing pretty much as many games as I can every season for the past 10 years straight. I only played rec growing up but I have always been a fast runner (I did track for 2 years in high school as well). I have refereed high school soccer the last four seasons and have refereed over 200 high school games alone in that time (I did 68 this season that just concluded). I have been in the soccer classes at the communities colleges several times.

Lastly I LOVED video games. I was at the right age to be in the golden age of online competitive games like Halo 2, Halo 3, Gears of War, COD MW 2, and more recently Rocket League.

Now for the more recent developments and getting towards the point.In high school I always wanted to get all the homework done well but I never wanted to necessarily excel or think about my academic future. I got mostly As in high school but didn't strive to make it matter. I wanted to do the work so that went well and then get back to playing video games. It is funny looking back because both ways my social life really suffered because I mainly focused on those two things. After I got the music degree I drifted around for about a year and a half not doing much academic. Then in 2017 I felt like I really needed direction and I decided to pursue dental hygiene, not because I have any experience in any type of serious profession, especially the dental field, but I could tell it was a good career. In 2018 I did all the science prereqs to get in. I wanted to go to the community college but it is so hard to get in their lottery system that I have gone for a for-profit school program instead. I could have started last September but I decided to delay so I could play and referee more soccer (I know right).

Things have gotten rough. In 2017 I decided I was going to really improve my guitar playing. I played so much that I got like tennis elbow or forearm tendonosis or something. My forearm hasn't been stable since. It is always tight, but playing guitar immediately makes the arm flare up for a week or so, so I had to stop playing guitar completely. I also can't play video games, lift weights, do pushups, hold the computer mouse too long...In 2019 I decided to take a yoga class. The forward fold pose really hurt my back. Then I got my lumbar spine moved slightly to the side in a mosh pit in May 2019. It hurt pretty bad but the chiropractor was able to use the adjustment table to put it back into place. But it has been unstable on and off with a low ache lasting weeks at a time since. I then was playing soccer in September 2019 and headed the ball and got a concussion that lasted about two weeks.Now, two and a half weeks ago in February 2020 at my indoor soccer class a guy elbowed me in the rib. I went into a rage (totally uncharacteristic of me) and I fell trying to go after him and I hit the wall. A few minutes later I headed the ball and got another concussion.The last two weeks have been the worst of my life. I didn't get pain or a bump from the hit to the head but ever since I have been depressed, a little lightheaded, and have slight headaches. Maybe worse, my neck doesn't hurt but it feels slightly forward and tight and just off. When I move my neck to the left it always clicks on the way back. My knees are also starting to hurt for no reason. My back has really been acting up a lot too.

I was officially accepted into the dental hygiene program yesterday. And I am having to give up guitar, playing soccer, and video games because of injury. Basically I am having to shed all aspects of what I enjoyed in my younger self to reinvent myself. I also struggle with motivation. I am addicted to my phone, youtube videos, and listening to music. I need to make that not dominate my life and make something of myself. I have lived with my parents my whole life and really need to change. So I have put off my forearm issue for too long and it may interfere with the dental hygiene career, but I am going to start physical therapy. I have no health insurance so my option is to pay a private physical therapy practice. I also feel like as a male I am especially useless to anyone unless I make something great out of myself, even a basic job won't suffice because you can't really move out on your own unless you have a really great job.

So essentially this is feeling like a classic tale of having to reinvent yourself. I put off really getting a great start because I was still doing a lot that I loved and nothing else interested me. But now I am especially so conscious of how things must change. What has made it so hard is the chronic pain. I still have 7 weeks before school starts, and it will be an intensive full time job. I need to do whatever it takes to get healthy. It is amazing seeing all the incredibly dark and dreadful places the mind can go when your life goes certain ways. Being in this concussed, stressed about the future state with several aching pains that have lasted weeks makes it feel like this dread will never end. But I can hope it will and do all the things I can do to make it better. And maybe someday this will be more like a memory that made me stronger. Just writing this out has been a good exercise that put things in perspective and gave me optimism. I guess what I can hope to gain from anyone commenting is if they relate or especially if they have recovered from any of these pains like forearm pain, back pain, neck pain, and concussion lasting at least a couple weeks.

On the hopelessness of life.,"First of all, I'm not officially diagnosed and from a third world country so not priviliged enough to suffer :D

This is just my subjective experience. I feel like my life is shy from a literal miracle, utterly hopeless, but I can't tell anyone because no one can get inside my head and change or experience life through my lens, on top of that, I feel like the idea of just living day in and day out waiting for it to end, not enjoying or looking up ahead to anything, waking up already disgusted and burdened by your existence is a bizzare  and alien idea to most people, despite the illusion that it's normal and widespread on the internet. 


I'm 23, male, college student. I've dropped in and out in the past five years to due a lot of reasons that I'd summarise as: I fucking hated every second there and it's wrecked my mental health and on top of that didn't learn anything valuable.


So, yeah, I don't think I have depression, my life just sucks, I think a therapist would infantilses this or simply be helpless and throw drugs and good intentions at the problem and hope it goes away. I think having healthy habits, a good diet, working through your cognitive and behavioural maladaptations is important, but they don't solve problems, they just calm and pacify. But why should anyone not want to turn their life around and make it enjoyable instead of putting up with whatever it throws at you? This ties back at the core of why I feel hopeless - I know life is enjoyable, I know that suffering isn't all there is to it, yet being poor, having failed to get a degree, having no skills. It's hard and there is no way out.

"A long story, if you have the time.","Let me tell you about a kid I grew up with. Let's call him Smiley. Now, I remember Smiley being a happy kid. Liked Ninja Turtles and Batman, pizza on his birthday, and just having fun being a kid. But Smiley had problems, or rather, his daddy had problems. You see, his dad was angry. Really angry. I have no idea why he was so mad, but Smiley's family always knew when he was. Smiley's daddy also liked to drink, a lot. And when his daddy would drink, he'd get really angry, and then people would get hurt. Smiley knew this was going on, and it scared him. I don't know when it all started, but I do know that he was only 4 or 5 when he came into the living room after hearing a commotion to find his mommy, bruised and bloodied, laying motionless on the floor and his daddy standing over her. Smiley tried to help her. He never got hit, but he was thrown across the room. Next his big brother stepped in, and Smiley watched his dad punch and kick his brother down the hallway. Things like this happened a lot, but this time has always stuck with him the most. He definitely never tried to step in again. 

The abuse went on like this for a few years. Occasionally, they would go on camping trips without dad to get a few days of peace. Things would be different for a short time after returning, but his dad would always find a reason to get mad eventually. Smiley never got hit, well at least never closed fist hit. He'd get the belt if he got out of line, though. He was so little at the time, but he knew it was only a matter of time. He was so scared and he just wanted to feel safe, so he made up a little game. I call it mouse. He started pretending that he was a mouse, and there were rules that had to be followed at all times. 

1 Don't be seen. If he's never seen or noticed, daddy might not hurt him. 

2 Never ask for anything. If you do, dad might get mad because dad doesn't like spending money. 

3 Never complain, or argue or really make any sound because you don't want to be noticed. Being seen or noticed is bad. 

Smiley got good at the game. Really good. He spent as much time as he possibly could in his room. Door open, of course, his daddy didn't like closed doors or secrets. He had a bookshelf just stacked high with all kinds of adventures he could go on. That's almost all he ever did. He hid away and felt safer. Eventually, Smileys mom and dad got divorced and no one had to be scared anymore. I was so relieved. Finally, a chance for Smiley to have a normal childhood. 

Smiley, safe now, thought everything was OK. He knew that his brother and sister and his mom were doing bad because of everything that happened to them, but he thought that since he was never really beaten, he wasn't affected by it. You see, Smiley didn't know until years later what his sister was going through. And now, his mom was so focused on getting Smiley's brother and sister the help they needed, and smiley never really showed immediately obvious signs of trauma, that he kind of got missed on getting a chance to deal with everything. He continued, business as usual. 

He made friends at school, it just took a while to feel comfortable around people. He never really felt comfortable being alone with people, especially men. But that seemed normal, you know, stranger danger and such. In high school, he even managed a serious girlfriend! I thought he was doing pretty well. He attended a local college and met his future wife. 


They hit it off right away. Over the course of 5 years, they dated, moved in together, and started working on a family. 3 kids a dog and a mortgage. They were living the American dream. It was always tough, socializing and fully loving and trusting another person and such, but it was most definitely worth the effort. Things felt like everything was going to be ok. 

But things weren't really OK. He couldn't see it at the time, but he was still playing mouse. He'd built his entire life around it. See, he had crafted, what he thought was, a perfect solution to the problem he was facing at a very young age. And he didn't realize that he was continuing to live like that as he grew up. Honestly, he had no clue how much his life was based around being afraid. He avoids uncomfortable conversations at all cost, because he doesn't want to make anyone angry. He hasn't really had any friends since graduating. Hes always felt like the third wheel anyway, so when he didn't see friends for a few days, he assumed the stopped wanting to be friends. 

Also, Smiley feels sad a lot. He knows what depression is, but he never really felt like he had a reason to feel sad, so it must be something else. He was on medication for a short time, but he felt like a fake or something. That he had no reason to feel sad, and he is just being a baby. Also he absolutely hated how the medicine made him feel, so he stopped taking it. He learned to embrace his sadness. It became just another part of who he was. He lived in it. He would make a point to replay every bad thing he could think of to make himself feel worse, because somehow, it felt good, comfortable even. It made him feel better to be sad, because no one could ever take that away. No matter what happend, he knew that he still had that. He finally had control over his emotions. Or so he thought. 

Do you know what happens when someone who feels like everyone is out to get him and that he somehow deserves it, realizes that the one thing in his life he was sure of, the only thing he felt he could always count on, isn't what he thought it was? I bet a lot of you do, actually. He took it hard. He always felt like he didn't have very far to fall, but he was oh so wrong. He learned just how much further he could fall. The woman with whom he'd spent the last 13 years, the love of his life, the woman he imagined growing old surrounded by grandchildren with, had an affair. EA/PA in fact. It had been going on for about a year, and she's in love with him. She said Smiley's emotionally distant. That he doesn't show his feelings. That she doesn't feel loved by him. It's almost certainly true. Not that he doesn't love her, but that he's just been really bad at showing it. 

It's been a year since D-Day. He feels very alone now. He feels more sadness than ever before, he tells me it hurts in the most horribly wonderful ways. But it's not all bad, right? This has forced him to look at himself in ways he never has before. He seems to want to gain control of his life. Maybe this is what he needed to get real control over his life. I just feel really bad for him. I've suggested repeatedly that he get into counseling, but as of yet, he hasn't. I hope he knows that there is someone who cares about him. I'm just really relieved this is all happening to him and not me, I don't think I'm strong enough to handle it all. 😊",t2_4nrr972u,1,0,1,"A long story, if you have the time. Let me tell you about a kid I grew up with. Let's call him Smiley. Now, I remember Smiley being a happy kid. Liked Ninja Turtles and Batman, pizza on his birthday, and just having fun being a kid. But Smiley had problems, or rather, his daddy had problems. You see, his dad was angry. Really angry. I have no idea why he was so mad, but Smiley's family always knew when he was. Smiley's daddy also liked to drink, a lot. And when his daddy would drink, he'd get really angry, and then people would get hurt. Smiley knew this was going on, and it scared him. I don't know when it all started, but I do know that he was only 4 or 5 when he came into the living room after hearing a commotion to find his mommy, bruised and bloodied, laying motionless on the floor and his daddy standing over her. Smiley tried to help her. He never got hit, but he was thrown across the room. Next his big brother stepped in, and Smiley watched his dad punch and kick his brother down the hallway. Things like this happened a lot, but this time has always stuck with him the most. He definitely never tried to step in again. 

The abuse went on like this for a few years. Occasionally, they would go on camping trips without dad to get a few days of peace. Things would be different for a short time after returning, but his dad would always find a reason to get mad eventually. Smiley never got hit, well at least never closed fist hit. He'd get the belt if he got out of line, though. He was so little at the time, but he knew it was only a matter of time. He was so scared and he just wanted to feel safe, so he made up a little game. I call it mouse. He started pretending that he was a mouse, and there were rules that had to be followed at all times. 

1 Don't be seen. If he's never seen or noticed, daddy might not hurt him. 

2 Never ask for anything. If you do, dad might get mad because dad doesn't like spending money. 

3 Never complain, or argue or really make any sound because you don't want to be noticed. Being seen or noticed is bad. 

Smiley got good at the game. Really good. He spent as much time as he possibly could in his room. Door open, of course, his daddy didn't like closed doors or secrets. He had a bookshelf just stacked high with all kinds of adventures he could go on. That's almost all he ever did. He hid away and felt safer. Eventually, Smileys mom and dad got divorced and no one had to be scared anymore. I was so relieved. Finally, a chance for Smiley to have a normal childhood. 

Smiley, safe now, thought everything was OK. He knew that his brother and sister and his mom were doing bad because of everything that happened to them, but he thought that since he was never really beaten, he wasn't affected by it. You see, Smiley didn't know until years later what his sister was going through. And now, his mom was so focused on getting Smiley's brother and sister the help they needed, and smiley never really showed immediately obvious signs of trauma, that he kind of got missed on getting a chance to deal with everything. He continued, business as usual. 

He made friends at school, it just took a while to feel comfortable around people. He never really felt comfortable being alone with people, especially men. But that seemed normal, you know, stranger danger and such. In high school, he even managed a serious girlfriend! I thought he was doing pretty well. He attended a local college and met his future wife. 


They hit it off right away. Over the course of 5 years, they dated, moved in together, and started working on a family. 3 kids a dog and a mortgage. They were living the American dream. It was always tough, socializing and fully loving and trusting another person and such, but it was most definitely worth the effort. Things felt like everything was going to be ok. 

But things weren't really OK. He couldn't see it at the time, but he was still playing mouse. He'd built his entire life around it.

My life is shit and it's my fault,"In a pretty useless worthless person really. I can't cope with a proper job or full time work.

I cant do it anymore.,"I dont feel like continuing with life anymore. I'm 13, and I've been living on the brink of poverty my whole life, along with my family. For my 10th birthday, me and my family couldnt for anything. We had no money and lived in a homeless shelter. It destroyed my mentally.

I'm 13 now. And we are doing a little better. We got out of the shelter and now live in a 1 room basement apartment. One room. For 4 people.

"Lack of work destroying my sleeping pattern, diet, motivation overall","Hi. To start off I’m just going to say I wouldn’t say I’m ‘depressed’ per se. I’m thankful that I don’t feel as low as I have done, and haven’t experienced some of the feelings and thoughts that I know lots of people in depression do. That being said, I was severely depressed around this time last year and for some time before that, stemming from working too much, doing none of what I love, and then eventually being made redundant for the 2nd year in a row whilst going through a very rocky time in my relationship at the same time. 

I went to therapy to help with this. I also started exercising again, something I hadn’t done for years, mainly because I couldn’t be bothered as I worked so much. While both these things helped me get a bit of focus, learn about myself in life and relationships, control my feelings and be in a better state of mind, I still haven’t managed to find another job in my field (teaching). Ive been limping along doing supply teaching since September. I really don’t enjoy it. It’s really unreliable, long term bookings have been abruptly cut short and I’ve had lots of periods of unemployment since September ‘19, ranging from anything from a week, to a month or several. Have struggled to get up in the morning so many times since then, in many cases just not being able to get up altogether and then spending the next day or two in bed, hardly eating, being up all night and asleep all day. This directly influenced one work booking being cancelled on one occasion. This has really got me down because I used to be so motivated, even with something I didn’t enjoy like supply teaching, I still tried to look at it as ‘at least it’s getting me up, about, doing something somewhat rewarding and productive, and allowing me to earn some money’. Lately I’ve been struggling more and more to adopt that same state of mind. 

In December I decided to go about changing my career. I applied to the work in the Police. Whilst this has given me more inspiration and drive to move forward, that career change is still in motion and it won’t start until at least June if not later. To achieve and maintain this career I’m going to need to get very fit and healthy and maintain a good diet to aid that. So sleeping pattern is everything. I know I can do it, but I feel like I need routine, and motivation to get up in the first place in order to get there. I’ve managed to get along the week before last, getting up early, eating well, exercising, being social, going to bed early etc, but after a while the motivation to do this just went out the window again.

At the moment I’m once again struggling to get work in supply teaching. Was meant to be working somewhere for 2 weeks starting from last week, which got cancelled this week. What I am struggling to bear at the moment is how these periods of unemployment keep ruining my motivation. I get down, end up ruining my sleeping pattern, this has a really bad affect on my diet and I keep losing weight and any progress I made from exercising, often just not going to the gym at all. I’m not happy with my weight, I want to put on more as I was really overweight before. The lack of work/ sleeping pattern/ exercise lately hasn’t helped my mood and I feel I’m quite irritable, unwilling to get up and have generally been isolating myself. I know I’ll be able to improve this once I begin the police training but until then... it’s really getting me down because in particular I felt like I made really good progress particularly in terms of my drive, motivation, and fitness, but keep falling down and going 2 steps back. When I’m feeling motivated I feel like nothing can touch me, I’m the most driven person out there. Then I wake up another morning and it’s just like that switch in my head has flipped, and I don’t see the point in getting up again. I’d like to go back to my therapist but I can’t afford it at the moment at all. 

Does anyone have any tips, thought processes etc that help them maintain sleep, diet, exercise patterns when they’re not feeling motivated or driven in life in general?

TLDR: unemployment ruining my health, mood, fitness, sleeping pattern and diet. Would really appreciate some advice.

Just having a relapse,"I was just starting to get better. Since august of last years I was able to go to the gym, started working at a new job, everything was getting back on track.

I'm in so much pain,"First of all, fuck everything.

I have this thing where I go numb for a long while and I feel indifferent to everything bad that happens. Then, out of nowhere, all of the emotions suddenly come back, like a dam's cracked and then I feel emotional all day for no reason whatsoever.

I'm having one of these nowadays and good lord it fucking hurts. I can't bear it. 

I feel like an extra in my friend group(s) and I have this habit of just latching onto someone and then clinging onto them. Last week I had a heart-to-heart with a friend, like a 20 min convo, and then all of a sudden I felt myself clinging on to him. Like whenever I see him in a corridor at school I'll run over to him, always talk to him when we're in a group, constantly try to be around him etc. This isn't a crush, neither is it the first time. This has happened several times with a lot of people. I just latch on and then suddenly everything they do is very important and I use them to determine my self-worth.

Today I made a joke and he made a weird face and that's it, I just fucking spiralled into my emotions again. I was hit with how my parents don't give a fuck about me, how I'm failing my A-Levels (my grades are literally Us), how all my friends probably find me annoying as fuck. And now I am once again in a depressive episode despite being okay for so long.

Tbh I was never okay this entire time. I was hit with so many failures from all ends - my grades, my relationships, my lack of skills/talents/hobbies, my own personal life. I just felt numb for so long I just didn't care for a bit. And now it's hitting me all at once. 

I can't take this. It hurts like a motherfucker. I was walking home today and everytime I crossed a road I thought, I literally cannot care less if a vehicle hit me rn. Like just do it. I'm a failure and I hate myself. Everything is cruel. I wish I was never born.",t2_55ek82ts,2,0,1,"I'm in so much pain First of all, fuck everything.

I wish I was good at something,"I try to do so many things

I play the drums, keyboard, guitar, flute, recorder, djembe and other instruments but I’ve never gotten the hang of any of them. I’m very mediocre, no matter how much I practice.

I’ve played mine craft for 2 years, and I still can’t create something by myself, I go and watch a YouTube tutorial.

I play with Legos, but I always just play with what I’ve built, I don’t have the creative capabilities to imagine new things

I tried my hand at photography for a few months, didn’t work out

I tried drama, swimming, basketball, football, badminton, tennis, even cricket and after weeks I could barely cope up with the basics

I love my music but I rarely listen to anything new, something just stops me

I’m kind of a funny guy, I tried stand up comedy and won once, but the second time with some neighbors who asked me to joke around for them they told me “this is so boring, let’s do something else” halfway through a bit 

I’m not smart, I don’t read books anymore, I research and try to educate myself on some topics but my comprehension is quite poor

I'm so stupid.,"It's been a long time since I've been depressed but I'm here again. This isn't like before. Before it was part of me, something I carried inside that just wouldn't go away. Slowly it did, slowly I got better. But now? This is the worst I've ever felt. Those days combined feel nothing like how I feel now. I know, it sounds cliche but it started with a girl. Doesn't it usually? But this is different. I've been broken up with. I've been cheated on. This is something new. This is every old wound ripped open, this is every new wound tearing away at me. I've never felt so used, so humiliated before in my life. I want to kill myself so I can escape the shame of what happened. So I don't feel so worthless, so stupid. So vulnerable. 

I visit my family's home country pretty often. I have close relatives and I always enjoyed spending the summers there seeing them. That's where I met her. We'll call her J. She was beautiful, she was crazy. She was extroverted and wild, she made me feel like everything I ever wanted to be. We fell in love. And it was so hard to say goodbye, to let go. But we stayed strong. We stayed committed. We stayed together for the next four years. There were ups and down's there some really great moments, things I'll never forget. Things that made me want to marry her. So I asked. She said yes. I started filing her paperwork that day. Lucky for us, her father who lived in the united states had already done so. For her, her mom, her brother. While we waited for an embassy appointment things got rough. She got distant, she cheated. But we worked it out. She convinced me it would never happen again, that she loved me and didn't want to lose me. That I was the best thing that ever happened to her. I believed her. So I forgave, and we waited. Things were good. Our relationship grew stronger. I loved her with all of my heart. Finally, we got the news, her family visa got approved for an embassy visit. Where she lives, she'd have to leave her country to go to a neighboring countries embassy. Her family isn't well off. So when she didn't have enough money, it wasn't a surprise. I paid for it. I paid for all of it. I paid for her mother, I paid for her brother, I paid for her. I paid for her tickets, I paid for the food she ate, I paid for the medical appointments. Everything. She was so happy when she got approved to come to the united states. God if I could share the look on her face with all of you. She was so happy. I was too. It was the best day of my life. Four years of waiting. Four years to start our lives together. She arrived, she was going to stay with her family for a little while. A little while turned a little longer. And now there is no life together. She say's ""Sorry, I never meant to lie to you. I just don't want to hurt you anymore. I don't feel the same way. I do love you, but I can't pretend I'm in love anymore, and me moving to be with you, isn't good for any of us. I don't want to be with you anymore."" But she did. She did when she was taking my money, she did when I was paying for every trip, she did when she needed my help. She told me so. She told me how much she loved me. Every day. Until the day she arrived.

Depression is like going to prison for no reason.,"I'm laid in bed... I know it's going to be one of those nights where I dont get a wink of sleep and it hit me, I'm literally in fucking prison.

I've got no money to do anything because i lost my job. I've got no aspirations, I dont enjoy anything, I'm surrounded by people who piss me off, I'm fucking stuck in my house, tho sometimes I'll maybe go for a walk just to make sure I move my limbs. 

It feels like I'm in prison, and the worst part... I havent done anything wrong. I havent killed anybody, I havent raped or robbed anybody. I've literally gone to jail for fuck all.

Only thing worse is theres no electric chair to end my suffering. Haha! Fuck, even criminals have got it better than me.",t2_a8hex,58,0,1,"Depression is like going to prison for no reason.

My confession,"This is the first time I m sharing like this . I am unable to feel joy since the age of 13 , other emotions disappeared at the age of 14 . The best thing that has ever happened to me was probably the time when I fell in love with one of my closer friends . I've been trying to be nice to her for an entire year , at some point i just stopped upon realisation of senselessness of the whole thing , only to be officially rejected  after a year of failed attempts. Later I've confessed my feeling , witch were fake , to other girls . I didn't want them to like me back , I did it because I wished I could feel emotions like back then . Of course , nothing worked .

Held Together...,"Got yelled at by my manager. No, this thing wasn't done wrong ""a half-dozen times."" We nailed it the third go-around because each problem had a unique set of circumstances.

My mother keeps saying, ""Other people have it worse; you should be grateful,"" and ""Get off your lazy ass and get a second job."" It's not laziness; it's depression because everything here is so fucking expensive and *no one* can afford to live on their own. A second job at my current wage cannot afford anything more.

I can't talk to friends and acquaintances; it's always, ""I don't know how to help you..."" I don't want help; I just wanted someone to listen. Therapists are too fucking expensive in my area, even with shitty basic medical insurance (Fuck you, American health care).

Do i have depression? Need an outside opinion from someone not biased.,"So i saw a psychiatrist today for the first time after seeing a therapist on and off for about two years. Ive been extremely taken by what i was told today which was that my heavy mood swings and low mood (that i have had for about a year now- due to life events and i'm assuming a chemical imbalance because my fathers side has a history of severe depression) was because simply of my sleep schedule. When i go to sleep every night fluctuates and sometimes it can be as late as 11pm to 6am, i dont think i have insomnia as i am just usually watching stuff. I seriously thought i had depression or atleast some mental health issue as i know that many teenagers (including my friends) get sleep like mine but are just fine. I have struggled with a little bit of drug involvement (mdma) in the past few months which the psychiatrist also blamed on my low mood. I dont know i just feel like they are belittling my problems and my parents think i should go on medication but the psychiatrist just simply swept it to the side. And its not like im constantly severely depressed like i still have a job and school which i do go to but i will feel miserable at them, if i could rate my constant mood on a scale of happiness it would be like a 5/10 and i will get crazy mood swings (not just like normal teenager mood swings) like i will switch emotions from extremely agitated to depressed to like manic happy in seconds with no reason why. Could this be some type of bipolar or any other disorder? Is it just teenager hormones? Or do i have arising depression which will only get worse?

Any opinions or suggestions because this has kind of made me feel like my issues are all in my head and i have had problems with suicidal thoughts and self harm but im getting different opinions from everyone.

I am willing to answer ANY questions i just really would appreciate someone helping me in this.",t2_4p4q5qbv,4,0,1,"Do i have depression? Need an outside opinion from someone not biased.

I’m officially homeless,"I’ll be in a hotel room in 18 days, warm eating something horrible for me that’s fast food.

But that’s in 18 days. 

How do I stay alive, I’m pretty sure (hopefully) my body won’t give out, I’ve dropped to 112 pounds. No food near by, but we will eat what we have to.

I begged online for the past like 13 days, got about 31 dollars total. 

Can’t lie that was the best and clutch moments of 2020 so far.


I can’t beg everyday for food, or should I say the next 18 days.

Idk, I just needed to post something to distract me for a minute,

"Having a Normal, Healthy Routine is Amazing. It's a Bitch and Half to Get Back into Though.","I cannot stress enough how content I was when I had ""normal"" routine. After every work day, I would go home, take care of the dogs, clean the kitchen, make dinner, and do other miscellaneous chores. And before work, I was even doing 30 minute workout sessions at the gym!  Then I'd have one fun thing planned for the weekend in addition to going grocery shopping. Life was amazing during this time period until something disrupted this routine. 

First, it started with the new year. I stopped going to the gym because it was getting crowded and I told myself that I'd go back once it died down. It's March and I still haven't returned. Then my husband got sick for a week and I had to stay home and nurse him back to health (A few unpaid days of work is cheaper than a night in the hospital). So there goes my after work routine!

Since these events, I haven't cooked a meal in God knows how long. There's dog fur and dust everywhere  and the dishes and laundry are backed up all to hell! My motivation is at an all time low. I'm angry at my husband for not picking up the slack. He's the neat freak after all but can't be bothered to fucking dust because his mommy did all the housework growing up. Though he'd never admit that he doesn't contribute. He blames ME for going out my way to enact a healthy, at home routine for chores and cooking, saying I didn't HAVE to do it. I could've WAITED for him to get home to help, you know?

Well, you know what? I've WAITED until you get home to help and you know what happens? ""Oh, work was a killer. Let's just order pizza."" Or ""Let's just be productive on the weekend and clean then."" Excuse me?! You can't try and make ME feel bad for illuminating the fact that YOU do next to nothing around the house. All I'm looking for a little GODDAMN appreciation and acknowledgement, you fucking asshole!

Anyway, this is a post about how routine really helped me combat my depression. I got a real sense of accomplishment with every completed task, no matter how small. It really sucks when you get knocked out of it for whatever reason (*cough cough* sick husbands). Hopefully, one day I'll be able to achieve a routine that focuses a little more on redistributing at home responsibilities in a more equal fashion this time. I think having some accountability in day to day routines could help me not fall so far behind in the future. I just need to sit my ass down with my amazing husband and create a routine TOGETHER this time. That way none us feel like we're underappreciated or not helping out enough. And if my dear, sweet husband finds that his work is too taxing and that he can't stick to a routine like this, then he better treat me like a goddamn queen for sticking to a routine that enhances BOTH of our lives!

P.S.

This post turned into a venting session. I'm sorry about that, but hopefully other people out there can relate to my feelings. I absolutely love my husband and he works his ASS off every day and struggles with anxiety.

Looking for resources that both help tackle self-hatred and improve myself,"Hi! I hope it's ok to dive in and ask for advice?

I'm looking for resources (books, videos, workbooks, recommendations for types of therapy etc.) that help address two things:

* A fairly strong sense of self-hatred
* Bad habits and other things I want to improve about myself

I realise that could sound contradictory (is the problem my opinion of myself, or are there actually issues with things about me?), but I believe they go together to an extent. But quite a lot of resources seem to tackle one or the other (or even at the expense of the other).

For example, I am seriously overweight due to comfort eating for years. This is a tangible problem I need to address. However, I also really hate how I look, my body etc. - which is counterproductive and draining.

From a bit of searching, it seems like CBT could be good for addressing bad habits, but I've had negative experiences with it in the past - it's left me feeling incredibly judged, and like a massive failure. So I'm wary of it - it's felt like I'm paying someone to help me beat myself up.

Any responses &amp; suggestions appreciated.",t2_d096r,1,0,1,"Looking for resources that both help tackle self-hatred and improve myself Hi! I hope it's ok to dive in and ask for advice?

How do you keep going? My partner and I both have severe depression and I'm drowning,"I have severe depression and anxiety, and every day is like walking through sludge. I've been medicated for this for about 7 years, I've been seeing a new therapist and she's great... But it's so hard to motivate myself. Today I managed to get up and have a shower.... only to get right back into bed and fall asleep until 2pm. I can't focus. I can't work. I'm so easily distracted. I've gone back to study, and I thought I was doing something I loved but now I just feel so apathetic and numb that I don't know how to conjure up any of the feelings I had when I applied for my programme. I honestly just want to sleep all the time. I don't know if it's a side effect of my medication (venlafaxine) or not, but I just feel so goddamn tired. 

To make things a bit more difficult, my partner is extremely depressed for a lot of valid reasons, but can't get help because of finances. We're also unsure if it's actually depression or something else, they don't want to go on GP recommended meds until they're evaluated by a psychiatrist, which is extremely expensive. They refuse my offer of help, because I earn less than them, but I have at least one parent who actually cares about me enough to be helping me out with my therapy costs on the months I can't afford them. I'm very lucky, I know, and I hate that my partners parents are actually wealthier than mine and yet don't give a shit about their kids mental health. 

My partner had a breakdown tonight, which has become a fairly regular thing. They keep saying they think about killing themselves every single day. That I'm the only thing keeping them alive. That there's nothing else to live for. I don't even know how to respond to this. Part of me just freezes every single time. I love my partner, I do, but I feel like this heavy weight of responsibility just falls onto my shoulders every single time they say this  and it feels suffocating. I know this is because of my own depression and my own issues, but it makes everything so gd hard. I don't know how to help, I don't know what to say or do or think. I'm struggling so much on my own, that I literally don't have the ability to pull someone else from that kind of darkness. I try my best, honestly I do. I try to push my shit to the side even for a moment, but I can never say anything right. I can never seem to pull them out of it. 

I'm scared to talk to people about it because everyone  says you can't be in a relationship with another depressed person, and I know that to an extent there is some truth in that... it definitely opens the gates for more toxicity, dependency, and fear. But at the same time, having someone who understands what you're going through, not freak out when you have your bad days, empathise when you're low and never judge you for how your feeling is the best thing. I'm not judging my partner for having these breakdowns, it's just that I'm so scared for them. I'm scared they'll never get help. I'm constantly worried and trying to figure out a way to get them to go to therapy. We've made a deal that if the suicidal thoughts get too much and too real that we will always always talk to each other and never do anything without that conversation. I know people get caught up in moments but I know they would honour that promise. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this here, I just feel so helpless. All the time. I don't know what to do. I just want both of us to be better. I'm scared that people will think I'm in a relationship that's doomed, I'm scared that I'm actually in a relationship that's doomed, I'm scared that I'm one of those people who is waiting for their partner to ""change"" - I never want to be this person, and in my mind I'm not waiting for them to change, I want them to get help and try to learn to cope with how shit the world is. 

Anyway. TLDR: I'm diagnosed and medicated for  depression, my partner's severely depressed but could potentially have something else going on up there, and I don't know how to keep afloat. I love them and want to make it work.",t2_5j4i1ii4,2,0,1,"How do you keep going? My partner and I both have severe depression and I'm drowning I have severe depression and anxiety, and every day is like walking through sludge. I've been medicated for this for about 7 years, I've been seeing a new therapist and she's great... But it's so hard to motivate myself. Today I managed to get up and have a shower.... only to get right back into bed and fall asleep until 2pm. I can't focus. I can't work. I'm so easily distracted. I've gone back to study, and I thought I was doing something I loved but now I just feel so apathetic and numb that I don't know how to conjure up any of the feelings I had when I applied for my programme. I honestly just want to sleep all the time. I don't know if it's a side effect of my medication (venlafaxine) or not, but I just feel so goddamn tired. 

To make things a bit more difficult, my partner is extremely depressed for a lot of valid reasons, but can't get help because of finances. We're also unsure if it's actually depression or something else, they don't want to go on GP recommended meds until they're evaluated by a psychiatrist, which is extremely expensive. They refuse my offer of help, because I earn less than them, but I have at least one parent who actually cares about me enough to be helping me out with my therapy costs on the months I can't afford them. I'm very lucky, I know, and I hate that my partners parents are actually wealthier than mine and yet don't give a shit about their kids mental health. 

My partner had a breakdown tonight, which has become a fairly regular thing. They keep saying they think about killing themselves every single day. That I'm the only thing keeping them alive. That there's nothing else to live for. I don't even know how to respond to this. Part of me just freezes every single time. I love my partner, I do, but I feel like this heavy weight of responsibility just falls onto my shoulders every single time they say this  and it feels suffocating. I know this is because of my own depression and my own issues, but it makes everything so gd hard. I don't know how to help, I don't know what to say or do or think. I'm struggling so much on my own, that I literally don't have the ability to pull someone else from that kind of darkness. I try my best, honestly I do. I try to push my shit to the side even for a moment, but I can never say anything right. I can never seem to pull them out of it. 

I'm scared to talk to people about it because everyone  says you can't be in a relationship with another depressed person, and I know that to an extent there is some truth in that... it definitely opens the gates for more toxicity, dependency, and fear. But at the same time, having someone who understands what you're going through, not freak out when you have your bad days, empathise when you're low and never judge you for how your feeling is the best thing. I'm not judging my partner for having these breakdowns, it's just that I'm so scared for them. I'm scared they'll never get help. I'm constantly worried and trying to figure out a way to get them to go to therapy. We've made a deal that if the suicidal thoughts get too much and too real that we will always always talk to each other and never do anything without that conversation. I know people get caught up in moments but I know they would honour that promise.

PTSD sucks,"Daily I feel like I’m carrying around 40kg on my back, sometimes it disappears, but most days it begins to crush me. I can’t sleep properly. I always think of the what if. I’m safe now, we both are. But every time the door goes it scares me, terrifies me. It could be them again. The messages, the threats it brings it all back to the forefront of my mind. It’s horrible. I’m grateful to still be alive, but this feels never-ending. 

I’ve always had issues with depression and anxiety, I know it gets better with exercise and therapy. But you add another thing to the mix PTSD. It scares the life out of me. I wake up screaming, sweating reliving the same thing over and over again. 

Anyways, I just needed an outlet. Somewhere to speak a little freely. I’ve struggled terribly the last week or so.

"Someone almost put me back together and left me, making me fall apart again.","I met a guy who was different. He called me out and thought I had depression. I was surprised cause no one else really cared or noticed. He had gone through depression as well, and had friends with it. He genuinely cared because he knew how painful it was. He comforted me, listened to my problems, and even complimented me. His compliments ended up being kind of flirting. He confessed he thought he liked me for 'one night'. I kind of realized I'd been falling for him. I confessed as well, but then he said he was confused. Either way, we still talked. Summer came around, and suddenly he was too busy to talk? When school started again, he started to take an interest in me again, but that was short lived. A month later, he told me he only wanted to be friends. I respected that. But suddenly, even our friendship was gone. And it hurt like hell because he was the only one who understood and cared enough. 
Sure, I had this other guy friend who was close to me, but he had never been through depression and didn't know it well so I was afraid of scaring him away. 

I tried to reconnect with the guy a few days ago. No luck. I cried twice that day. I often cried over him at random periods, wondering why I wasn't good enough for him. Why I was so boring that he just randomly left me.

I ended up talking to my other guy friend about this. I had told him I had depression, but never really opened up like this. So, I did. I even cried on voice call, something I've never done before. But I trusted him and knew he was one of my closest friends. He comforted me, even sent me a long text after we ended the call telling me how much he cared about me as a friend. 

(Back story from the guy friend: I had became friends with him before talking to the guy who made me sad. I had liked my guy friend first, but my feelings changed when I talked to this boy. I trusted my guy friend from the start though. He had always been the nice guy. He ended up getting a gf, who was one of my friends, during the time I started talking to the other guy)

So, I guess I learned something. I picked the wrong guy to open up to. As hard as it is to admit and accept it's true. If I had only talked to my first guy friend from the beginning, I'd have probably gotten the support I needed. Real comments about friendship and how much he cares, rather than a guy who did help me but ended up flirting and leaving me hanging. Someone with non confusing feelings rather than a guy who's a literal puzzle that I need to analyze and understand.

I don't know if I want to save the friendship, I know closure would prevent me from hurting more, but I guess I'm just a coward, idk.

Quebec French Makes Me Depressed,"Today, I want to share my thought in case it’ll help me feel better from depression.

I’m a guy from Thailand married to a husband from Quebec, Canada. We’re happy together, he’s the best thing in my life. We got married in 2017 and we had lived in Thailand a year before moving back to my husband’s hometown in 2018.

It’s been overwhelming for me since I landed in Montreal airport waiting for the connecting flight to Quebec city. Everything was in French and people spoke French. I was as ignorant as a guy from another side of the world who blindly assumed that Canada is a whole-English country that has French as a second language mainly exists in the Quebec side. I was panic when I saw my personal document in French. It’s so annoying having to ask my husband to translate them.

Next, I was living in Quebec city with my husband. I finally learnt that French is the only official language of Quebec province. Even though a lot of Quebecois can speak English, I was still struggling to enjoy living there as an English-only speaker. What did I do then? Learn French! I can’t find a good job, make friends or going out alone if I don’t speak French!

At first, I tried to learn French but I felt like it’s such a waste of my time to start from zero since I already speak English and we can move out of Quebec and live in an English province. Of all in Canada, I ended up in Quebec because my husband is a Quebecois and he didn’t think that I would be reacting this badly toward French in Quebec.

Moreover, there’s a lot of little detail that made me depressed and anxious such as I was being stared at anywhere I go because I was the only Asian guy among White people, I travelled abroad before which I didn’t care those staring because I wasn’t trying to live there; I have to shadow my husband around because I can’t speak French and the social manners, the culture, the humour, etc. are different from where I come from which overall making me nervous to communicate.

I’m happy to be with my husband though I’m so depressed. I used to be so active in Thailand, I had a job, family, good friends, and tasty foods. Since I arrived in Canada I’ve been unemployed, made no friends, mostly stayed at home, and the worst is gaining weight. Now we’re in Montreal. We moved here in search of diversity. I feel better because there’s more of my kind and people are more comfortable speaking English with me, but French is still the matter.

Our fund was running low and my husband went to get the financial aid from the government. He didn’t know that I would have to be included in the process. I was so furious to find out that I must choose to do something which is finding a job or going to school. Now I’m obligated to participate in the program if we want that financial aid. I’m devastated, I do not want to go out to do anything at all while I’m still in this French-speaking province. I want OUT! I want to move out of Quebec.

We can cancel that financial aid but I do not want to bother my husband’s parents even that they’re willing to help. They already helped us a lot. So now, I ended up having to go to school to learn freaking French! I feel like I’m being forced, I’m raped by this French province. I don’t want to find a job because I know I can’t go well without any French. As I said, I don’t want to start learning the language from zero.

I don’t want any solutions, the only option is moving out. I like Quebec, the cities and my husband’s parents, but I do not want to live here. Now I have to endure another year and a half going to French class because I’m obligated to do so to satisfy the financial aid program. I’m so depressed that I want to hurt myself multiple times a day especially when I’m home alone. I think of the way to die in my free time which I have all day. I’m still composed only because I love my husband and I know that he loves me. I also love myself (or used to?), but my mind and body don’t work well in this situation.

Writing this down and share to the public seems like something that I should do so I don’t feel like I’m carrying this alone.

I think I'm depressed due to being so isolated/trapped. Any advice welcome.,"I work in a very small office on the outskirts of a city in the UK with one other person, who is great but is 66 years old (I'm 25) so we don't have much in common. Even the things we do talk about get repetitive and dry, as it would with most people. I love my job and am in a privileged position to be in it, so quitting isn't going to happen, nor do I think it would solve this.

I live with my girlfriend. We do argue a lot but its fine overall. She puts me under a lot of pressure though, and my friends are really evasive with me. They either don't arrange for me to see them or blank my attempts to arrange things myself.

Point is - I've never been this isolated. I used to feel that even if two of the three things I've mentioned (work, friends and relationship) were going badly for a period, at least you could count on the other one to escape them. But now it seems its all going wrong. I dont know what to do and really need help as this is completely new to me.

While everybody else seems to be enjoying their lives, I feel I'm wasting my twenties. I genuinely can't remember the last time I met somebody new or the last time anybody asked to spend time with me. It really is soul destroying.

Lonely,Im just lonely. I don’t have friends. The last time I felt loved and not used by a girl was like 5 years ago. It just seems like I’m a sort of punching bag. Idk why I’m telling you guys shit like this. Yesterday I had a panic attack or Idk what it was. I started to cry out of nowhere and my body felt like I was exploding. I had so much emotions and all wanted to come out at that moment. I cried for like an hour. I walked around the room heavy breathing and punching the wall. When I put the first foot in my room I saw my mirror. I felt so shit to see myself crying and screaming. So I punched the fucking mirror. Now I have a hurt hand and a broken mirror. My moms gonna be so pissed about this. Idk what’s gonna happen but I can’t explain myself to her. It just feels like no one wants to understand me or even tries. I feel like I’m worthless. I wish I would be a rich fuck so I can drug myself out of this but eh this shits unfair. If I want 2 die I need to do some fucked up shit...,t2_pm14g3,3,0,1,Lonely Im just lonely.

How do we get up in the morning?,"Are we just on autopilot? I realized that I have made so much room for the beast that is my darkness. What started as a little blip 6 years ago has grown into a cancer in my life. 

My tenures at my workplaces are getting shorter. I'm getting fatter, destroying my relationships on purpose. I've taken to heavy weed and alcohol use to numb life but my growing tolerances make me go to higher lengths to get a buzz.

I just got some great news,"I hate my voice. It's so nasally. It has been described as sounding like Carl from Jimmy Neutron and Kermit the frog.

Do people pretend to be depressed to get out of a relationship?,"We were so in love and it was a beautiful, deep relationship. He left 6 month ago, saying he is in depression and he feels nothing for anyone anymore. He needs time to heel and focus on himself, but he is not willing to say farewell to me because he is not sure if he fell out of love or if it’s his depression that steals feelings from him. I always trusted him and I did not doubt his words first. I was kind, understanding and supportive, because depression is a horrible hell. So I gave him the space he wanted and waited.

We are long distance, so we did not see each other since that day. I called once in a while to check up on him, if he is doing better, if I can do anything. I heard the same story every time, that he is a bit better, but he still feels nothing for me and that he is very grateful for my support. I don not love you NOW are exact words. He was always replying my calls, talking politely but cold, said it is difficult for him to talk to me be because guilt overhelms him. I decided to give even more space and stopped calling, making sure that I leave channels open for him in case he wants to talk. We clearly agreed that when he undestands if his feelings are gone or back, he will call to say either to let me go for good or get back together. I started doubting about his depression, because he lives a normal life, changed the job to a better one, went for a week trip with new friends, does not have any truly dark thoughs taking over him. He is not laying in bed unable to do anything as people usually are in admitted depression, he is far from being suicidal. And I am very glad for that, I do not wish him to be in that dark state, but I can not stop doubting, if this depression is simply his way out from me. He is not taking any meds. I asked if depression was actually diagnosed by his therapist, he never replied to that.

In short, in all 6 months he never initiated the contact with me, he never asked how is my life, now we are on third month of no contact at all, he did not even text me on New Year, he ignored my last call. Nothing, no effort to maintain any contact with me, despite saying he is afraid to lose me and he dreams of me almost every night. Who messes with someone’s head like that?

So now, in this not-well-established-break up, I find myself so torn between being angry at myself one day and feeling stupid for allowing to treat me like this, for probably using depression to get out of relationship, as a total coward. And the other days I feel guilty for not being supportive enough, for not doing more to help him, although my strengths are evaporating. 

I know until I have hope I cannot get the closure that I think every person deserves. I feel used and tortured. I still do not see clearly if this is over or not. Maybe I underestimate depression or maybe I am the biggest fool. All these thoughts are driving me crazy every day and I am stuck. I do not know how and where to move forward from this. I need to pick a side and I am afraid to be mistaken in this choice. On the one hand, I cannot believe anyone is that cruel to not let go if the one does not love you anymore and sees your suffering. On the other hand, I cannot believe a person does not feel the love for half a year and considers it can just come back. It feels like the perverted torture from the person that means the most. I want this pain to end. And the worst part, that I do not know what I am more afraid of: to get that “It’s not you, it’s me” polite call one day, or to never receive any closure. Am I being so cynically ghosted?

I don't know why I hate my birthday,"I don't know how long I've hated it for but I know I've definitely hated it since I considered attempting suicide a few years ago the night before my birthday

Thing is, at first, I make plans and have ideas and then it's like a switch

I feel physically ill over the idea of anyone mentioning my birthday, I feel so guilty people at work have got me presents... I kinda hope they're lying

I've asked my family for nothing, I don't really want to acknowledge the day.

As so many other people's birthdays are the same month, i focused on everyone else's, got a load of cake, organised a gathering, got them cards signed by everyone and buying presents 

Then people would joke ""hey it IS your birthday too ya know?""

I'd just laugh and say ""don't worry about it""

I have no idea why my birthday makes me so miserable and depressed,

I feel like I'm getting older and I'm a failure, I feel like I'm too old for a partner now and I'm dying alone

I just don't want to face anyone on the day

When I was excited I suggested a party but I didn't have anywhere to host it... Being depressed I just dropped it... Now one of my friends has offered to host it and I feel so touched yet a bit sick... I hope its for everyone

Getting back on my anti depressants,"It got so bad I started crying on the way to school.

PPD sucks, being alone in everything sucks.

Wanted to give recovery a true chance.,"And they shut down the whole country. All mental health services are cancelled undefinitely, and my psychiatrist is locked up in the hospital with covid patients. My rxs expired today, but I was able to stockpile for at least this month of shut down.

It's so hard to find the point,"Hi, I'm not sure how long this will be.

But someone I've barely 1 on 1 with, my professor, can sense how much of a failure I am. 

I give up."

Feels really bad,"So i would say my story starts around a year ago. I was abusing alcohol and got into a DUI accident which also totaled the vehicle I was driving nothing covered. From this I attended DUI Drug and Alcohol classes. Got an interlock (non mandatory). I also recently settled in court for 3 years probation and a $2500 fine. I am a college student who makes $15 an hour working full time and attending college during the evenings. I have about $2000 in my bank account at this moment. I quit drinking alcohol and attempted to get out of the slump that I was in knowing i could do better. I got a new (to me) vehicle. Got my SR22 insurance and paid off $1000/2500. This past weekend after starting to feel that life was/ is getting better I was involved in another accident and by far my absolute biggest. I was merging onto the highway after it had just rained for the first time in a month and started to hydroplane. I attempted to correct it but spun out and ended up being hit by a semi. The vehicle i was driving is totaled. The semi was totaled and i am so thankful that neither my wife nor the other driver was hurt. However from this my insurance informed me today that i am liable because i hydroplaned onto the highway. I have 15,000 in personal injury coverage which may help if anyone decided if there was an injury after resulting from the crash. Currently my main focus now is the 10,000 in coverage that i have from property which defines the Semi-truck, the guardrail and the light pole. I believe this is way more than 10,000 in damage and i have no idea where to turn from here. Should i be hiring a lawyer? Should i file for bankruptcy?  Any advice would please help. I'm beyond freaking out. I had to leave work today because i can stop breaking down i feel so bad. Sorry if this is poorly written. I will do my best to answer any questions i can that could help you determine the next steps i should take.

Insomnia,"I can't sleep tonight. Again. It's keeping me up, a mix of the soul-crushing anxiety I feel about both the immediate and existential, and the painful feeling of being sucked in through the void inside (the kind of feeling that makes you want to peel your skin off, in the hope that it will stop). 

I'm in physical pain, like always. I can't distract myself from the chronic joint pain that is sometimes in my knees, sometimes in my hips, but always all over. It's not as bad as it was a few days ago. That flare up was helped by sleeping for two days straight, so while I'm no longer dealing with as much physical pain, I'm dealing with the fall out of sloughing off my responsibilities in favor of a lazy solution to my problems. 

 I still can't sleep. The sun will rise soon, and tomorrow will be fucked, because getting no sleep at all is now somehow physically painful. I've been on pretty much every antidepressant, anti anxiety, holistic cure, but the problems with my body keep adding up and I'm struggling to treat everything that needs to be treated. The days where I struggled to find an ADHD medication seem laughably simple, because now my ADHD is at the very bottom of the list of things that need medical and pharmaceutical attention. 

It feels so hopeless. How can I keep a job and provide for myself like this? I've already failed at too many things to count, none of which was officially 'my fault', though I've been the common denominator in every situation. How can I not blame myself for failing, even if these failings stemmed from issues I have very little control over? I hardly can bring myself to try any more, because failing is so expensive, and so shameful. I look back on what has been invested in me and feel so wasteful.

How do I go on?,"Hi,
I don’t really know where or how to start this. I’ve had anxiety and depression on and off since I was 18 (that’s 6 years for reference). But I managed to push through it, went through the motions of life, felt the emotions. It was do-able.
I met a guy 2 years ago, we started talking and then dating. He was my rock for a year and a half, he was always there for me, cheered me on when I was down, encouraged me to keep going and get help. We broke up this January, it was too much for him, me and my mental illness turned him into a different person. I took it really hard, I’ve been on the brink of suicide four times in the past two months. He’s saved me each and every time, screamed at me on the phone to go home, that he’d tell my mum what was going. He doesn’t know it but two of those four times I was in a park tying up the knot on my bought rope, ready to hang that sucker on the nearest sturdy looking thing and end it all.  He’s moved on now, he’s there for me, and he’ll always be an ear to listen. Life is looking up for him, he’s got a great job opportunity, he seems happy and joyful with life. I on the other hand had bad news after bad news. I found out I couldn’t have children, then I had a concussion, got let go from my job due to being mentally unstable and not someone they could rely on. I’m so close to pulling the plug. I’ve been seeing a therapist once a week for almost 9 weeks now, but it hasn’t helped in the slightest. In fact, she just makes me bring up these childhood situations and makes me despise my mum. Today, is his birthday, mine is in 6 days, I don’t want it. Last year he flew to me and surprised me, this year I’ll be alone and in tears. I’ve harmed myself multiple times, no one knows this. I’ve taken too many antidepressants many times hoping I wouldn’t wake up the next day. 
I can’t go on anymore, nothing is fair in life, and I didn’t expect it to be. But it was always do-able, now nothing has a meaning anymore, I’m just a walking talking vessel living every day.

Edit: tomorrow I’m finally going to end it, this evening I’m gonna watch a couple of my favourite shows, eat a hearty and good last meal. And tomorrow, just disappear and disconnect. I’ve had many attempts but tomorrow’s gonna be it. I didn’t mean for this to sound so melodramatic",t2_16meuz,1,0,1,"How do I go on? Hi,

I don't have any energy anymore.,"I don't really care about advice or anything. Just venting.

There's just nothing left in me anymore. I feel like a shell of my former self. I'm trying so hard to get back into a better place and just nothing happens. I feel like an empty pit of dread. My friends and family have noticed I'm on a sharp decline and I can't really even talk to them about whats actually going on in my life.

My therapist was an asshole and gave shitty advice, so I haven't been back. I feel alone, and scared that I'm started to head back to where I was before I pulled myself out of this shit a couple years ago. Just...empty. I dissociate almost constantly now, not even thinking about anything. I used to describe my depression as a monster inside of me waiting to come out...but now I know the truth. It's the seeping sensation that literally nothing I do matters. That there's no way I can ever be truly happy, even though I have people that love me.


And that makes me feel even worse; guilty. I've started drinking way more than I used to (only had like one beer a week), and now I find myself chugging handles of Jack to which my friends have commented on. I've started smoking weed almost constantly. I've started self harming, and gained thirty pounds. I'm scared of what I'm capable of, honestly.

Waking up,"This has gotten so bad. Forcing myself to just wake up in the morning and go to school has become the hardest task of my life. 

Every time I wake up I’m just filled with this completely horrible dread and am faced with absolutely no will power to get up and do what I have to do.

The routine is getting to me too I guess. Wake up, get dressed, and go to the place that stresses me and drains me the most for 7+ hours. 


I literally burst into tears just because I have to get up and couldn’t take that awful feeling anymore. Almost like I’m either gonna puke or have a panic attack every single morning.


It’s so freaking pathetic and frustrating.

Suffocating,"This is new for me. I don't talk about my issues with anyone I hate the thought of pushing my burdens on to others and I don't make posts like this because I'm always afraid of getting answers that I don't want to acknowledge.

 I'm 24 years old married to a wonderful woman who truly is the only reason I stick around in this world for.

I'm suffocating. Drowning within a constant numbness that's been growing within me for years. There is nothing that satisfies me. Job, family, friends, sex, games whatever it may be. I feel nothing towards anything. I feel as though I'm stuck in a void, this never ending blackness that consumes me and pulls me away from the things that should be important or held dearly by me. 

I never want to get out of bed and it's an effort every morning to move. I go through my days having conversations with myself as to how I feel. This voice within me constantly berating me telling myself I'm worthless and have no place in this life. 

I have no desires nor wants, dreams or ambitions at best I just exist like a mosquito sucking the blood from whatever gives me a short burst of any kind of feeling other than this constant blunt scraping in the back of my head. 

I wear a mask every day for my wife who has her own things to deal with in which I try so hard to help with. For my mother who I don't want to worry about me. For my sister who is growing into a young woman and needs all the support she can get right now. For the few friends I have who just wouldn't understand or who I'm afraid would exile me for being different. For myself because the person I am inside my head is vulgar, dusgusting bile with no consistency no purpose. 

I just am. 

I don't rightly know what I expect to gain from this post other than a feeble attempt to romove the thoughts within me elsewhere for a time so as to be free for only a short while. I can't cope with this in my head any longer its like lice in my hair itching, scratching, scraping it never ends. I just need it to end to stop I need to silence the silence. 

This was the best way I felt I could articulate what goes on inside my head and I've left plenty out as the post would probably never end. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to  read this.

Getting out of bed,"A few hours ago, I again got the intense urge to spend the day in bed. The thought that I may not have to interact with the outside world felt overwhelming and extremely appealing. The idea made me ""happy."" Or so I thought.

For over a decade i've had this philosophy of, although I don't believe in God, for the sake of argument, if a god were to have quotas of, ""this many cancer cases per year, this many loving relationships, this many suicides"" etc, then I would relish the chance to be one of those that helped fill the quota of one of the ""bad things"". If me dying of cancer means that someone more grateful or deserving of their life doesn't have to, then I can delude myself into having some sick sense of martyrdom to ease the dying process.

Now that everyone around me is freaking out over the new trendy illness, i've been tempted and today almost acted upon putting myself into situations that increase my likelihood of getting infected. I don't even know the symptoms, I can tolerate physical pain to a decent extent and don't think whatever Corona has to offer will transcend what i've felt already. 

I'm not sure why i'm even posting this. I don't have a question or anything to accompany it. I guess if I had to have one, am I fucked up for seeing this new, apparently highly contagious disease as only a positive, potential avenue to off myself? The only deterrent stopping me is that fact that it's contagious, and wouldn't want to harm the little family I have.

"I found the best way to no longer feel depressed about the fact that I will always be depressed. Underestimating myself, and letting everything amaze me. Basically killing any tiny bit of ego I still have.","Hear me out. I've always been a boxing fan. For the longest time I pictured being the heavyweight champion. If it happened this year, and I defeated Tyson Fury, I'd grab the mic and say this: ""For 27 years, everyone I've ever met has doubted me. After tonight, there's not a person on the face of this planet who can ever doubt me again"". Then I drop the mic and walk out. Badass right?

Are you kidding me? That shit would never happen in a million years. I'm an uncoordinated dope with the reaction time of a dead person. That thought, finally killed my ego. And now I'm finally...happy about being depressed if that makes sense.

Over the past day or two I've started underestimating myself as much as possible, and I allow myself to be amazed by everything. The key is to not quit just because you underestimate yourself. I'll play Madden 20, and I'll think ""well I suck at passing so I don't think I'll complete this pass but I'll try. I just know it will fall incomplete"". When it falls incomplete, I don't feel bad because I knew it would happen. When I complete a pass it's like ""oh wow I didn't think I could do that"". Then if I'm playing someone online and they juke me out and spin and break tackles and score the old me would have been pissed. Dead ego me is like ""wow look how good he is.. I can't do any of that"". Boom, letting myself be amazed, and underestimating myself.

Same thing happens with girls. I used to be confident in myself but then feel shitty if a girl rejected me (which is silly because it happens to everyone at some point). Well now I just tell myself ""she's just going to say no, oh well"". Or if the girl gives me her number I think ""it's probably a fake number anyways"". That way if I get rejected or get a fake number, I expected it. If I get her real number, awesome, wasn't expecting that. You should probably not let her know you thought that way though. Have to be confident otherwise girls bounce fast as can be. I'd just rather not get my hopes up these days with my depression as bad as it is.

Then back to the being in awe part, I let myself become impressed by everything. My truck; ""Wow if someone didn't make this, I'd have to ride my bike or walk to work and that would take hours. It would suck if this was never invented"". Almost like appreciating everything to a ridiculous degree. ""Oh wow my favorite player is playing, I should watch this game, what if he died tomorrow? This would be his very last game"".

I also try and justify things I want to do. I still wanna lift and get big but my dead ego says ""I'll never get big"". So, I still lift, and I find reasons to do so even though I don't think I'll ever get any stronger or bigger. ""I like this Whey protein powder it tastes so good but I didn't earn it so I should lift so I earned it. I spent all this money on this weight bench and weights so I should at least use them. Someone else probably wishes they had this stuff"". 

I guess some of it you'll have to figure out yourself, in order to motivate you but this is what I do. I play dumb with myself. Pretending I'm awful at everything and being amazed by everything. Being humble is never bad though. You ever see someone who's actually really good at something, and doesn't even realize it? Like they're shocked when you tell them how good they are and it's as if they're blind to their own talents? Yeah there's nothing wrong with that.

So from now on everything amazes me and I don't think I'm good at anything but I still try because I don't know any better anymore. Or this is just a nonsensical rant and I'm creating a euphoric alternate reality because I'm so far gone mentally that it's the only thing keeping me from going insane.",t2_510io2c2,9,0,1,"I found the best way to no longer feel depressed about the fact that I will always be depressed.

I needed to rant,"Hi, I'm 19F. I just wanted to get some stuff off my chest in case maybe I could find some encouragement. I'm just struggling lately. Some background. I've struggled on and off with depression, anxiety etc most of my life. I've been medicated and hospitalized in the past. I've been to counseling on and off over the years. Started going again last month but honestly 50 minutes once a week isnt much. I want to get back on an antidepressant because my mood swings (not PMS related) are ridiculous. I cry almost every day about some stupid shit or another. I get so angry at myself for the mistakes I make, and the things I don't do. I just can't figure out how to love myself because I see myself as useless/lazy/stupid. I've had low self esteem for literally my whole life. It's such a bad habit I can't figure out how to break.

I don't get home til 6pm and when I do I feel like I no longer have energy for errands, cooking, or even seeing friends sometimes. I have what most would consider a good job, but I don't really care for it. What I hate myself for the most is that my boyfriend has to put up with my shit every day and I know I'm horrible to him, I'll get snappy for no reason and he doesn't understand at all.

And then like 2 minutes later I'm crying and apologizing to him yet again for whatever I did.

I feel like I can never get to all the things I need to get done. I'm always fucking tired. And I wish I could get my shit together. I'm just sad. I should be happy. I have a good life.

My 13 year old life.,"I just wanted to share my story to this world.
And sorry, I'm from Switzerland and my English isn't that good. 

Well, where do I start...
My life I had was really nice. I always was a little bit sad and depressed all the time, but I found a way to deal with it. And then it happened, I met the most beautiful girl in my life. I started to talk with her, and after a short while, we were together. I was so happy, I couldn't believe it. The relationship between us lasted for 3 months. These 3 months were the best I've ever had. Then it all started to break. It knew, that something is about to happen, but I didn't want to have that. I just wanted to love her so much. I wanted to much. Then it happened. She broke up and hurted me so much. Not because she broke up, because the things she said. She said that I wasn't ever depressed, that another guy is more important to her and that she changed too much because of me. This was the really first time I cried so much that I couldn't sleep. It hurt so much. I respected her decision, even tho it hurt. I just want that she is happy, and that no one hurt her. And now, in school, I hate my life. Everyone is staring at me like I am a monster, and her friends always come to me and start to bully me and make me down. And it's not like I don't have any friends, but something doesn't let me accept help from them. I just destroy more lives with that and I don't know what to do right now. Since that moment she broke up I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to do.",t2_5bv4p3vd,4,0,1,"My 13 year old life. I just wanted to share my story to this world.

Fiancé is struggling right now and doesn’t seem like he wants to help himself. Kind of freaking right now,"Sorry if this ends up being a long post. 
A little background: we’ve been together for about 5 years, dating for two, engaged for the last 2 months, getting married in August. I have never been depressed and do not stuff or at all with having a more positive outlook on life (I am blessed and lucky) so it’s so hard to understand what he’s going through and how to help him deal with it. I’ve always known that he has struggled with what I would say is mild depression, and it was only last year where I really got him to accept and realize, in a long convo, that it was depression that he was feeling. He’s not very in touch with his feelings and I think has a skewed (narcissistic) view of himself. 

Ever since that conversation it seems like during his dark days he has all the regular symptoms and has no desire to do anything for himself and kind of trudges through life, which I get. But on his good days he has this sort of hope where he believes things are changing in him and then he won’t go get any help when he actually has the motivation to do it.

Previously I have been able to deal with this behavior pretty well since I consider myself pretty emotionally stable and strong. But recently I think the symptoms have worsened a lot, and fast. To the point where he has a pretty significant drinking problem and he doesn’t treat me very well (no abuse!) or just treats me with complete apathy. It sucks for me but I try to think of what it must be like for him. He struggles with insecurity and shame and let’s those feelings conquer any sort of lesson he could learn from them. Here’s my dilemma, I don’t know what approach I should have with him. It seems like anything I do is annoying to him whether it’s gentle or tough love. But which one should I do? Should I help him by cleaning his messes and letting him sleep and being gentle and just making myself available to him? Or should I encourage him to get up and clean and do work even when he doesn’t want to, and sort of pry in conversations with him to get him to share his feelings (good to note that he will never share anything on his own)? I’ve tried to help in many ways but it’s pretty obvious from his annoyance and defensiveness that he doesn’t want help. And if I know anything it’s that you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to help themselves.

Why am I alive?,"I have seen people, talented people, suffering from major illnesses. Some even dying. I have no special talents, very few friends, messed up relation with my family, academically poor, yet I still survive, and a burden for literally everyone. At least if I die I can help so many people by donating my organs. But yet I lack the courage to commit suicide. I believe in God, and always thought that if I survive the bad times, the future will be good. It's written, have faith, perform your duties, and carry on. But I think God doesn't even think about me, left me a long time ago to be by my own. With each passing day, I hope that the next day things will definitely change for good. But it doesn't. Trust me, hope is not a good thing, it's a poison. A slow poison that takes away everything from your life. 
I have tried talking to people, but they easily lose interest in me. Like sure they always tell me to stay connected, but after a substantial amount of time, they ignore me. I don't blame them, I am a boring guy; no talents, morose and depressed.

"The antidote is life, not death.","Think about it, why do you suffer?   
I suffer because I am slow. I don’t move. I don’t eat. I don’t have a job. I don’t create. I don’t socialise. I deny all help. I am practically a living corpse. Being this close to death I can say that this is far from peaceful and to move further in this direction means to suffer even more.  
   
What does the depression want?   
Depression wants me to slow down more. Depression wants me to stop. To starve. To sleep. To destroy myself. To isolate. To reject life. To die. Depression lies and tells me that life is the source of my suffering even though my pain comes from the feeling of not living.  
  
What makes you better?   
I know what makes me better. It’s all the advice I have turned away from in favour of all the things that make me feel like shit. Exercise, healthy food, routine, a job, a creative hobby, sobriety, human interaction, therapy. All the things that make the depression scream in panic and claw at the back of my mind. All the things that keep me alive and sane.  
   
How do you kill the depression?   
I can’t, it is the unchanging infinite incarnate. But I can overpower it. I can outsmart it. I can starve it and weaken it the same way it starved and weakened me. No more sleeping in. No more junk food. No more drugs. No more mind numbing, unproductive pastimes. No more reasons to feel guilty. No more reasons to hate myself. No more reasons to die. I must come to terms with the fact that I am now allergic to these things.

So depressed right now needed this off my chest,"I have to be honest with myself

I am not contemplating suicide at the moment, but i think self preservation is kicking in and im now stuck here, confused, not knowing what to do next.

I dont want to die yet, i still have fight in me, i want to see my kids grow up, i want to teach my kids about life, i want to explore new things, i want to go places, i want to pursue my dreams.

But im in so much debt right now, everyday is a waking nightmare, i cry a little everyday knowing that i still have to struggle for another day

Im so broke right now, i dont even have money to buy food, i worry about my kids when their supplies ran out.

I googled inspirational stuff to motivate me, it say things would get better but its been more than a year and things seems bleaker than before, ive already ran out of options for money, i dont know where to turn to.

Collections agents hound me everyday, im so stressed right now that i think im being paranoid. I dont want to look at my phone because those agents kept calling.

Every morning i always wish i could still sleep, to wake up on my own time, not being forced to wake up, i keep saying ""i wish wouldnt wake up again, wish i could sleep forever""

Im so sorry if my post is a bit incoherent, my mind is so stressed that i could not think straight

I dont want to go home, going home means accepting my fate and waking up tomorrow to face another stressful day

I want all of these to stop

Post Surgery depression spiral,"I had planned surgery one week ago, and everything went well. So far so good, just recovering physically as normal. Yet, the post-surgery depression is hitting me harder than it has before. I am on bed rest, and my mind is thinking backwards to easier times. While things right now are not bad at all (my only struggles are that I'm financially tighter than I have been in years &amp; I chose to move to a different country 5 years ago so I am far from family), I keep finding myself looking at a specific point in my life with rose-tinted glasses. I keep thinking about moving house back to my home country just to recapture that feeling of no financial stress. Yet, that really isn't a possibility for me, I own a house and I have settled here and have a better quality of life in most regards and am independent where I never was before. I just can't stop remembering what I think are better times even though I know they really weren't. I didn't even really have local friends back then - and I actually do now but sometimes I still feel extremely isolated.

Sometimes when I think back, it's like I'm remembering three different people's stories and not my own life. Does anyone experience this? I remember my childhood being one person, and then my early 20s is a totally different person's life... and now I'm a totally different third person. Sometimes if I think too hard, it's like I've got even more people's stories in there, even though this is all stuff I lived through and saw and experienced. I moved a lot of times in my life, to different places and now a different country, and it's almost sometimes surreal because I don't think that it happened. I just don't feel like.... this was my life. And I don't feel settled or comfortable in my own house, like I need to make a change and move somewhere else for some reason even though I fought very hard to buy this house and made it just right for me.

Sometimes if I think too hard, it's like I've got even more people's stories in there, even though this is all stuff I lived through and saw and experienced. I moved a lot of times in my life, to different places and now a different country, and it's almost sometimes surreal because I don't think that it happened. I just don't feel like.... this was my life. And I don't feel settled or comfortable in my own house, like I need to make a change and move somewhere else for some reason even though I fought very hard to buy this house and made it just right for me.

I feel like I'm going insane sometimes, because I want to uproot everything just because I am malcontent, and the past few days it has been in overdrive. I can't wait for this feeling to fade and to be on my feet again..."

Currently suffering through a bad bout of depression due to unemployment but have a lot of hope and am motivated. I’m seeking advice/learning how other people have dealt with this.,"Hi all,

I’m a 28 year old person living in Boston who has Aspergers and am MLIS (masters of library science degree)degree who has been unemployed for a month and a half and am having an existential crisis. Finished up grad school last August working as an archives assistant for a year and a half and then a temp at a large institution’s library for six months. I feel depressed for the following reasons.

1. Dearth of work in my field
2. Delusions that I’ll never have a quality full-time job
3.Feeling like I get so close in an interview but certain questions slip my fingers
4. Lack of confidence in my abilities due to paranoia and persecutory delusions about my condition and acute self-conscious about how others perceive me
5. Guilt that I perceive my situation at times to mostly be my fault
6. Ignorance complex that I’m not well read enough

These are the things I’m currently doing or did to mitigate my depression

1.run and strength train 3-4 times a week
2. Write fiction for 1-2.5 hours a day
3. Speak to my mom, brother and best friends throughout the week
4. Healthier diet
5. Gave a crap load of books to charity
6. See a therapist weekly
7. Take antidepressants mostly on time but everyday without fail
8. Loving kindness/compassion mediation to be more compassionate to myself and in a Nietzchean  fashion rid myself of societal guilt complex’s and affirm my own value/values
9. Finding ways to give away magic the gathering cards to schools/ Charlie’s and selling the significantly pricey ones
10. Read a lot of history, philosophy, and fiction to fuel my creative writing and to learn more about the world

I’m trying very hard but I feel an overwhelming sense of regret over my situation thinking that if I made better choices in the past I wouldn’t here. I also have a delusional complex that I’m a philistine who is not well read enough and will never catch up to my peers who are well versed in the western canon/multiple subject areas. On this ignorance complex I get freaked out with the enormity of the western canon and figuring out how I can possibly gain a masterly knowledge of it.

Well this was a long post but I want advice on how I can tweak things and learn about what it was like for you Redditors to go through some of this stuff.

Pretty sure my man broke up with me cause of my depression,"Not sure if this belongs here but uhh... Had some people commit suicide really good friends. and all I wanted was my man to hold me while I cry about my loss. He was “busy” and I could barely get a hold of him.

One day his muscles were hurting and I went over to take care of him and was gonna stay the night. When his muscles had stopped aching. He wanted sex so I was like why not(stupid me) and then like 2 hours later he told me know cause he thought he was sick and I was like “that’s ok. I’d rather get sick and take care of you” and we had like a whole debate. I had to leave cause I was feeling stressed and I told him before I left. “ Come with me I don’t like being mad at you can we talk it out” hasn’t told him about the suicides. His sister was dying. Didn’t want to bother him with my stuff. He wouldn’t come with me. And I was just like wtf and texted him how I felt rudely. Oops. And he broke up with me. I asked I was like please let’s talk it out and he was like tomorrow so tomorrow rolls around and I don’t feel too hot. I go to the wellness center. I sit there for a few and notice dudes phone and was like oh fuck. And he comes out and sits down. I’m laying down on the little couch and I go “what’s wrong with you” he goes “I got the flu I’m going home” dude slept with me then 4 hours later broke up with me and then I find out I have the flu. Yuppieeeee. After we all back and everything I get like this wierd feeling and invite him over. I thought I was pregnant and we still never had that talk so I told him about the pregnancy. He calmed me down and just told me to at Some point get a test and we talking stuff out and I apologized because I had it in my head that I was at fault so I didn’t tell him bout the friends but told him about my depression and the other shit happening in my life and started to cry he pulled me off my bed and made me hug him cause I “needed a hug” and he was like  “I just need to be alone for a while.

I'm having a hard time right now. I feel like I can't even find a thing to be upset at. It just hurts.,"So I'm 43 and I'm just recently coming to terms with the fact that my feelings aren't normal. I'm having a pretty hard time right now. I can see that in the past I've made excuses, denied, blamed other people or my situation. Recently I felt a dip and instead of starting a fight with my wife or saying something mean I just let it be. She asked what's wrong and I told her ""I'm just not doing well right now"". There was a big part of me that thought maybe being more direct would stop the slide. But it didn't. 

I don't have a therapist. I'm borderline ADD and I think the tremendous uncontrollable energy I had when I was younger staved off the lowest of the lows. At least it provided a distraction. But now it seems the highs are gone and the lows...I don't think they're lower. They're just always there. 

Anyways I really wanted to talk to you guys about my relationship. I've been married 15 years to a beautiful amazing woman, who doesn't deal well with this. She's very low maintenance. I think after a string of wild blow-out style relationships her calmness and ease really sold me. And it's been a good run. But she isn't a giver. Not really a taker, but if there's going to be energy in the relationship it comes from me. She's not active, not sexual, not funny, not motivated. She works hard, she's a great mom, we've had some awesome sex, and we are super affectionate...but it's like, she's available to share those things when I'm up for it. The energy is definitely generated by me. 

The only tool she has in her relationship toolbox is tolerance and space. So when I'm down she heads for the hills. She gives me ""space"" till I feel better. Her mom is a narcissist from hell who burns down everything around her at the drop of a hat, so I understand why she decided that is a good strategy. But it really makes me feel like I'm on my own. Or, it's my depression making me feel that way. I've told her before that giving me space when there's a problem just makes things worse. Oh, she also can not admit when she's wrong. Like ever. Zero. I'm fairly sure I've never heard a genuine apology. But she is trying. She asked me if I want to talk. And I realized I don't want to talk to her. I want her to be someone I want to talk with. I just don't think she is. And I can't figure out where to put that. I don't like my depression. So I don't think the ability to deal with my depression is a reasonable quality to request. And here we go with phase two. A little energy comes back and I just spin. Till it drops off again.

Faking headaches,"I haven't told anyone about this and I just want to get this off my chest and maybe even get someone's opinion about it.

I've had minor anxiety at the age of 10,which has gotten worse and started feeling down at the age of 12, which later became depression.

A bit after the age of 12 or 13 ( it's hard to remember things) I got a virus infection. It was nice to stay away from school and school wasn't great. I wasn't bullied or anything, but I didn't like school at all.

So after the virus was gone I started faking feeling sick so I could skip school more. I did it more and more to the point I almost stopped going to school and I think that continued for a year? I went to different hospitals to get help for my faked sickness, but of course that didn't help.

After that I started to fake a headache instead because I thought it would be easier to fake and I'm still doing it. At that point I've been regularly visiting the hospital and again, didn't help

Somewhere there I realized that I had problems with my emotions. Expressing them, talking about them, understanding them and so on. I think I was 15? I also realized that I might be depressed, but I didn't tell them or anyone for a few years about it. I didn't know how to, I was doubting myself alot and I did know if I even should tell anyone or if I'm just being over dramatic.

At 16 (?) I didn't go to school at all and I was very depressed. I had violent thoughts and cried myself to sleep at least 2 times a month. I started talking to a new friend about it and (half a year or a year) later told the doctors that I was probably depressed. I got to meet therapist but I never liked her. Infact she made me feel worse and I sometimes cried after the meetings. Half a year later (?) I got a new therapist and she was nicer, but not much help. I started self harming a bit before meeting her.

Now I'm 18, still self harming, still depressed, very anxious to do anything and getting worse. I've been going to a new hospital cause I'm an adult and the old one only takes care of children. All I'm doing if waiting to meet a specialist to possibly get some sort of mental disorder diagnosis (possibly aspergers?). Keep in mind, I'm still faking my headache.

I originally did it to skip school, but I think I later did it to bring attention to me because I wasn't and still isn't doing well mentally, at all.

Since this has been going on for so long, I don't know if I can tell anyone that I'm faking it and that the actual problem is my deteriorating mental health.

"The ""need to"" life","I thought today, that one of the reasons of my depression is that non reachable, or very hard to reach life.
I think that I will be happy if I will: exercise regularly, eat healthy, have interesting hobbies, meet friends , have meaningful job, keep my house clean etc..

People think if you're good looking you cannot be depressed,"M(21) Not much explanation needed here. Ive been told numerous times im good looking, offered to be a model, strong features yada yada.

I guess I'm venting with this post, but it doesnt matter what you look like. Depression hurts, and being told that is probably one of the most hurtful things ive been told.

Abusive ex part 2,"I ended up permanently ending everything with him (yay) but then I met a dude and we dated then I was happy with myself and I wasn't interested in dating at the moment, at first I didn't like him but he kept bothering me so I gave him a chance, we talked on our views and he lied saying our views were alike when in reality it was nowhere near , I told him my past I told him how I was raped and I told him all the pain I endured , just for him to lie and waste my time , he was super obsessive , he tried to get me pregnant multiple times and even told me he wanted to get me pregnant so I had to stay with him , all that just to find out he had a kid with another women , and then he cheated on me with that same women and put me through all unnecessary pain , I gave him so many opportunities to leave me alone , And he never did , he claimed he wanted a life with me , I was very conflicted , this went on for months , I didn't need any of it , he actually ended up assaulting me (on New Years) he texted me on a spam account and  used one of his profile pics as one of my teddy bears from a picture that I had only ever posted on snap  that he was outside right ? So I went outside cause I was sketched out And when I went outside he was in a different car from the one he usually drives and I went inside , we talked and he tried kissing me so I slapped him Then we started hitting each other right ?

Ignoring the guilt,"I'm supposed to be student teaching today. I only have a limited time to complete my total sum of hours, and while missing days can be risky, I have to consider my mental health. 

I've always struggled with putting myself first. I put others first, my education first, my love life first, my responsibilities first, but never myself. 
I know a lot of you can relate. People call people with depression selfish for feeling this way, self harming themselves, wanting to end their pain and take their life, but I see that we are some of the few selfless people around. 

If we were really selfish, we would let our depression win and let it take over us. We would allow ourselves to give in, to not try and fight, and to stop caring about everything. Instead, we are fighting depression. We are going to work and school. We are raising families. We are getting out of bed. We are staying alive. 

Depression is not selfishness. It is bravery. 

So many posts are rants, cries, pleas, and white flags involving the fights with depression. And everyday, we are still here. We are taking one day at a time. What others consider us being lazy for not going to school, or weird for not going to a social gathering, or selfish that we go to therapy, is actually moving mountains to us. 

I am proud of myself. I may screw myself with my hours, and I may need to make extra effort to make sure I finish. But I know it'll be worth it. 

My old therapist told me a saying once. 

Imagine the house you're living in. It has several rooms, and it can sometimes, those rooms can get messy. The bedroom, the closet, the bathroom, the kitchen, etc. They get messy, and that's okay. 

Instead of caving into the stress of the mess that is unraveling in your life, take one room at a time. You can take the biggest room first, like your bedroom, or you can start on the smallest room, like your closet. 

Your problems are messy rooms in your house. Yes, it can be overwhelming to deal with at once. It sometimes won't even be easy when taking one problem at a time. But you are taking the time to focus on yourself. 

To me, my bedroom is the most important room to me. Because of this, I relate that my depression and mental health is my bedroom. That is the first room that I always want to clean, that I want to fix. It can be hard to agree to that when there are other issues at hand that people expect you to tend to and ignore your mental health. 

I'm taking one day at a time. I'm having a lot of bad days, and I have a lot of messy rooms I have to tend to, but today I'm tending to my bedroom. To my mental health.

Getting Signed off work UK?,"Hey, so I'm thinking of going to the Doctor to see if I can get them to sign me off for a few weeks, just gonna tell you my situation and see if anyone thinks it's worth it. 

So I have had depression and anxiety  for as long as I could remember,  but 3 years ago I think I had a breakdown. My best friend convinced me to apply for a job at her workplace so I did, I got it and handed my notice in.  2 weeks before I was due to start my new job my best friend ended our friendship because I wouldn't go to her Dad's retirement party, she knew I didn't like parties or large groups I didn't know and she just said that me not going was the final straw. Anyway, I had to start the new job and work with her but she kept digging at me at work, undermining me and even put me forward to give a presentation knowing I had anxiety, then my trainer went on holiday and it was just me and my ex friend, I couldn't handle it so I called in sick. When I got back my boss told me I had passed my probation and the job was mine but he also mentioned my friend told him she though I was off work avoiding her not because I was sick. I broke down in tears (I'm a guy in my 30's so this was probably awkward for him) and told my boss I couldn't take the job, I explained what my friend had done and he offered to escalate to HR but I told him I thought that would just make it worse. In the end I worked my notice and left. 

I spent the next 6 months living off my savings and thinking about how bad a person I must have been for my best friend of 12+ years, who knew all of my anxieties, could just cut me off for something she should have understood.  Eventually, my Dad said he was being promoted and needed an assistant running his warehouse so I took it.  I now work for a builders merchants which only serves a maintenance company, we basically run the warehouse for them. It's only a small site but the company we work with is awful, the staff are too lazy to find somewhere to park and walk up the road so they park all over the loading bay. Literally, every time we get a delivery we have to unload it in the middle of the road that exits the estate and can get quite busy (we have a DPD depot here and they are constantly using it). My Dad just wants them all to like him so he just works around it but because I have been frustrated by it I have literally had their staff shout in my face ""Fuck off you cunt! It's our site"".  I have mentioned it all to our regional manager and he just shrugs it off.  Then there's my Dad's smoking, he has been a smoker since he was in his teens, I smoked until about 5 years ago when I gave up, but it was a struggle and maybe it's just me, but  I hate the smell of it now, it gives me a headache. My Dad thinks he has some god given right to smoke where and when he wants, he just lights up around me whether we are inside or out, he did it recently and I asked him to at least go to the warehouse door which was like 4 meters away and he laughed and just said no.  The staff all hate me for wanting to do my job safely and they all love to wind me up, my Dad does not even have the decency to smoke away from me and if I have time off for  holiday or something he always leaves loads of stuff for me to do when I get back because he didn't want to or couldn't be bothered. I just want some time to evaluate my life and my options. I am so miserable and I go to bed hoping I don't wake up so I won't have to go to work.

Death from small airplane,"Reposting for day people. 
So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire.

Just a little vent,All the years are the same and each week ends with another one. Time never stops. I'll never get a break. I don't know why I feel relief when one period of time ends.

I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years and it's really hard to kope with school and life in general,"Hi my name is Roman, and I had been with this girl for 2 years. It may not seem like much to you but it feels like forever to me...

She was my absolute world, she was my everything. 

But now she's just a person I walk past in school acting like we don't know each other anymore.

It hurts man... it really really hurts. 

All the old memories of her and I just roll past like a movie and it just breaks my heart seeing her beautiful face painted in my head like a master piece. 

It may seem creepy but i can even still smell her sweet vibrant stupid Ariana grande perfume she would boast about all the time hahaha ;(... 

Her voice rings through my head and that wonderful, cute laugh just never gets old... I miss her... I miss her so much.

I'm in year 12 and it is just so much more hard when I now have this problem in my hands. It's so hard trying to kope because I have no one to help me, no one to express the way I feel.

I don't mean to sound like I'm up myself but I'm kind of like the popular kid, but the one no one talks to. So I do have a lot of people it's just that people simply just do not care.

Everyone knows I've broken up with her and I act like I'm happy and it hasn't effected me but trust me... It has.

I've got so many assignments due and I haven't even started any of them, no outside job and just a whole lot of arguing at home with my parents.


ITS JUST SO ANNOYING BECAUSE SHE CANT GET OUT OF MY HEADDDDD.

I keep making it worst by looking at our memories on snap chat whilst listening to sad music to...

I have a long history with depression, Self harm and suicidal thoughts and they are just tempting me so fucking badly again. I thought I was free but they are always around the corner.

My mind is just in a blur and there is a pool filled of tears in my lap so I'll stop this right here. I'M in desperate need of help, and I really need someone to guide me because I am struggle so badly.

I'm Stuck,"My depression is finally starting to catch up with me. School has become significantly more difficult and my grades have started to drop. It's almost impossible for me to make new friends and keeping the few friends I have is much more difficult, and feels more like a chore except no matter how many times I do it nothing gets done. 

I've been thinking that perhaps my depression is not a result of bullying, lack of deep social connections, or my hatred of myself. I've been thinking perhaps there is something else underneath, except I can't tell my parents because anxiety (and they never do anything about my health concerns) which only makes me more upset and frustrated. 

I've been struggling with a severe case of writer's and artist's block, which sucks a lot and makes me feel like I'm stuck, like my creativity is being blocked by the wall of depression. 

Additionally, I know I will never be able to hold a job or move out or date anyone, even if depression becomes nothing but a sad memory for me. 

I feel like I'm stuck. Like there's nothing I can do to get better. Like I'll never dream again, like none of my dreams will be fulfilled.

I am empty,"Last year I was doing therapy. I talked a lot a kind of helped me put my head in place. But I noticed something about me that makes me worry more than anything: I was always empty.

When I was a kid, my birthday parties, going on vacation to the beach or to some relatives' house, studying, having friends, that was always about pleasing my relatives, make them proud. As far as my memory goes, I never enjoyed those things.

When I became a teenager I started feeling depressed. I spent years thinking about ""how did it come to this"" and ""what did I do"", but now I think that when I had more freedom and begun doing things I wanted, I always went into my room and did nothing. That was what I wanted the most: peace and isolation. 

It consumed me. It became worse and worse and I'm stuck in this cycle to this day. I don't know how can I ever get over it, except by completely changing how I am. Who I am is empty. There's no goals, no dreams, no fears, no will. I'm just an empty shell posing as a human being. I don't know how to create a personality or how to be ""me"".

Depression took over my day in a way I have never experienced before.,"10/03 
Today is the strangest day of my life. 
I wake up at 10am. It is a Tuesday. I decide not to go to my volunteer shift, but instead have a lazy day. My left eye hurts. My house feels strangely dull. 

I am alone. 

I lie in bed for a bit, then get up to have breakfast with a pot of tea. This is proceeded by a couple of hours of mindless videos. Nothing out of the ordinary for my lazy days. Minutes meld together, my eyes glued to the screen. 

I can no longer ignore the dull pain in the corner of my eye. 

I shuffle to the bathroom and examine the crevices of my eyeball at an excruciatingly close distance. The world blurs around me as I see a black, string-like object sticking out from the corner of my eye. I take a hold of it and pull. And pull. And keep pulling. I hold a long hair in between my fingers, covered in a thick, slimy goop. I stare at it for what feels like minutes. It goes straight into the bin as I stumble back into the kitchen. The world doesn’t come back into complete focus after that moment. 

Time continues to blur in an unfamiliar way. A hazy lunch and another pot of tea ensue. My dad arrives home. I ask how his trip was as he walks through the kitchen. I listen but don’t hear the response through the monotonous sound of a since-forgotten Youtube video. I stare at the screen as my dad shuffles around the house, getting ready for work. 

Around 3pm, I text my boyfriend to say that I am going to have a shower. Instead, I lie down on my bed for a moment. My dad yells goodbye as he leaves for work. I think I mumble something back. 

10 minutes pass, and my mother arrives home. I check the time. 5pm. She asks me how my day was. It was fine. I somehow manage to ignore the dull, pulsating pain that had suddenly pierced my left cheekbone. I lie there for a few more minutes, groaning weakly at my mother’s suggestions to get up. She asks me if I have eaten dinner. 

“No.”

“Well you should eat some dinner.”

“Is it ready?”

“No, I still have to put vegetables in it.”

“How can I eat if it’s not ready?”

“There’s pasta on the stove.”

“I thought dinner wasn’t ready?”

“There’s pasta on the stove!” she exhales. 

It is now 6pm. 

I get up out of bed as if the past three hours simply never existed. I eat a small bowl of pasta that makes me feel strangely nauseous. I love pasta. 

I finally get into the shower, after what convincingly felt like a collective twenty minutes. I figure some cold water will shock me out of this stupor. I stand under the tap, feeling the cool water run over me for a couple of seconds, only to realise that I have turned the wrong tap, and that the water is actually scalding. I jump and almost slip, still feeling the world blur around me slightly. 

I slowly adjust the water, and finally have the cool shower I need. I feel my surroundings crisp slightly, as if introducing more pixels into my bathroom. I stare at a body in the mirror that looks vaguely like mine, but doesn’t feel that way. 

I barely have enough strength to lift the shampoo bottle from the floor. I feel that I am balding as I pull dead strands of hair from my head. It doesn’t panic me as it usually does. 

It reminds me of my eyeball in the mirror. I stare into that giant glass pane once again. My body feels strangely numb. I notice how cold the water feels now. 

The damp stench of a used towel overwhelms me as I take a heavy step on to the bath mat. It had never bothered me before. The mirror continues to me in a way that I cannot describe. 

I eat another bowl of pasta in my towel, this time ravenous for more. It feels as if I haven’t eaten all day. 

And now I am here. 

The more I think about the day and the more I write, the clearer my mind feels. I still can’t understand how the hours of today melded together, feeling simultaneously momentary, yet sluggish.

My cheekbone still hurts.

The damp stench of a used towel overwhelms me as I take a heavy step on to the bath mat. It had never bothered me before. The mirror continues to me in a way that I cannot describe. 

I eat another bowl of pasta in my towel, this time ravenous for more. It feels as if I haven’t eaten all day. 

And now I am here. 

The more I think about the day and the more I write, the clearer my mind feels. I still can’t understand how the hours of today melded together, feeling simultaneously momentary, yet sluggish.

My cheekbone still hurts. 

Today was the strangest day of my life."

Just need to get some things out my chest.,"I am a nihilist and atheist, for me there is no value and no reason to be alive other than to increase entropy, and although I have been suicidal at times I could never get myself to do it because I am terrified of death, the idea of dying scares me so much.

Overthinking will be the death of me,"One main thing that I tend to do on a daily basis is overthink.

"A small milestone, a small change of mindset.","I just realised this this morning, and it makes me super happy and I just wanted to share to mark it.

I used to workout for all the wrong reasons, like wanting to be skinny because then I thought people would find me attractive and I’d have loads of friends etc. Because I wanted to look a certain way. And all that and more was a real drain, and contributed a lot to my not-so-great mental health. I wouldn’t say I had a eating disorder or anything definitely not, but I was very insecure about food and exercise and it didn’t help with my mental health. 

But I started working out recently and i realised i dont think like that anymore. Honestly I just want to get fit for my body, because, you know, I live in it. I want to be strong and able to do things. 

I guess it seems kinda dumb maybe but man my view on body image has changed so much (for the better) and i didnt even realise til now.

I’m terrified that it’s my responsibility to improve myself because I don’t think I’ll ever have the drive to do so,"Since I was in middle school I never cared for school because I hated myself and figured I’d kill myself soon, eventually dropped out in high school because what need do I have for an education if I’m going to end up dead.

I work 45 hours a week so I can cover my part of the bills but I despise going to work and just participating with existence, I see everyone talking about their normal lives and I become jealous and spiteful

Stress management rant,"I finally went to the doctors and got perscribed citalopram. Been on it for about a month now and have no major side effects. I feel like its working in some ways but its just making me content. I still have no drive to really do anything. No drive to improve myself no drive to learn anything no drive to push myself.

I feel like there's this mental divide between my ""In the moment"" emotions which are now generally balanced and long term emotions when thinking of my future, aspirtations which are still down and unsatisifed.

I went to see a therapist and he said I was stressed which i could have told him myself. So now I've been suggested group therapy for stress management. From my understanding I'm going to be taught techniques for managing my stress. Things like keeping a todo list. Meditating. Deep breathing.

These are all things I've tried doing myself in the past but I've never been able to stick with them. I'm honestly frusterated right now. I'm going to go to show I want to improve but I really don't see it helping at all.

25 y/o male feeling old and depressed after leaving the army,"Hey ppl,

my english is not on point so it's a bit harder for me to explain the things sorry.

Im very depressed because i spent all those years for the army and had no time to follow my dreams. I feel like i wasted my youth and adult years by nothing else... My social life is like zero, never been on a festival or to a club and rarely had a girlfriend. I get jealous when I see my old friends living their life having fun while i stuck at home and keep wasting my time. I also have to deal with some panic attacks and posttraumatic stress disorder from my military years in Iraq. Im unemployment at the moment and have no health insurance. It's hard to find a good job because i don't have a career. Im planing to make another education as an IT Specialist but with all my problems this won't be possible. I want to make changes in my life but I dunno how to start. My biggest problem is to deal with my wasted years and the things that i have missed out. I try to stay healthy and decided to hit the gym for the first time. It won't cure my problems but maybe it help me to feel more comfortable :) what advice would u give me for a better future ? I won't give up and i hope that i feel better one day ! :)

"Managed to keep it together for three years, starting to fall apart","
I have to put few things down, 

Few years ago, I fucked to up big time in every way possible, I'm talking health, work and family at the same time. 

It took me years to fix it. When I started landing on my feet, I managed to nail some things, took pride in my achievements, used to say : ""I don't deserve this, I earned it"". 

I was still miserable but my archivements inspired my close ones. This ok situation went for three years. It wasn't hell but it wasn't comfy either. 

Then last year came the hard times, I went full speed to try to overcome it, it was still alright for some time, like 3 months

Then when the hard times were over, I realized that I only managed to hurt myself and something in me broke. 

There is a me before and after that time. I've changed, I don't really recognize myself. People noticed. 

I've done close to nothing for months, can't think straight. 

I'm starting to think that my three years of ok time were just momentum I built on luck . 


Are some of us destined to lose while others are born into greatness? Is this some kind of balance? Am I failing so another one can succeed?

This year so far is rough,"I just turned 24 and I'm single never been in a relationship and I'm not sure what I want to do in the future, I'm so lost.

By high school we were old enough to take care of ourselves and once I left highschool I was on my own to find a job and do something for myself. I worked at a shitty grocery store for three years and decided to quit once my father had terminal colon cancer and he never told me until it was time for him to be in hospice after he passed I quit the super market, five months of searching for a job I landed a job at Starbucks and only stayed for five months since it was an incredibly difficult job and then I found a job at target working overnight and it sucks I've been here a year and I'm losing the motivation to move forward. I was also went to community college for a semester after my dad died but I just thought to myself what's the point.

My Spouses Depression,"Hi all, my spouse and I recently had a discussion about our marriage and they admitted to being incredibly depressed and they do not feel anything about anything. They admitted that they had resented me for 3-4 years at this point. They admitted that they needed to fix themselves and would seek help, which is amazing and I’m happy they have finally had that breakthrough. I feel like I have watched them suffer for years and tried to help as best I could but until they admitted it to themselves it was futile. Here’s the problem, I don’t love them anymore, I care about them and want them to get help but in my head sometimes I have moved on. I did comfort them and let them cry on me and said “no matter what I still care about you.” I don’t want to lead them on but didn’t feel it was the time to discuss that I don’t love them.

I don't know what more to do without risking so much already.,"I've only recently been diagnosed with depression and my doctor has been a huge help but she could only do so much. Im on medication, 20mg ciprolax, and I mean it usually helps but more often I keep having so many negative thoughts. 

I keep wanting to try to do more but every time I try something always happens and I go right back to ""what's the point?"". 

Even now writing this it feels pointless and I feel like I'm seeking attention even though I'm just trying to voice out my thoughts. I'm worried that if I go for more advanced help that it'll make my family upset or just put me in a bad spot financially. 

My family is very caring and so is my fiancee but the negative is also so much stronger and it's so hard to control it. 

I'm at an impasse in my life and though I'll never do it I always feel like ending it will finally give me that release that I want. To finally be free of everything in life.

But I know if I did that that it would destroy my mom, my sister and my fiancee. 

I just don't know what more to do. I'm scared, I'm tired, I always have to put on this face and happy go lucky attitude just so people don't worry but every day I only want to be left alone and just cry my eyes out and hope for death. 

I don't know what to do because each time I try to think I need more help I just think that I'm not that bad off that I'm over reacting and no one will understand or take me seriously. Others have gone through worse what do I have to complain about?

That's why I don't call to the suicide hotlines, I'm just downs and always down what can they do?..

Only like to be social when I'm drunk,"I am a female college student. I really look forward to social events with drinking involved because it feels like the only time I can be around new people without feeling awkward or like nobody likes me. At this point, I have to be super drunk to get to the point where I feel good about myself around other people. I feel pretty unhappy when I'm at a large social event and not drunk. Like if I have less than 5 drinks, I will definitely still feel self-conscious and scared to talk to people. Especially guys, but that's a whole different issue (I have a problem with placing my self-worth in what guys think of me). I know I don't have an alcohol problem; that's not what I'm worried about.

I just have such low self-esteem and anxiety about what people think about me. I wish there was a way to be the real me around people without getting drunk, especially because I can act a little too outgoing or embarrassing once I'm like 8 drinks deep. It just sucks and I don't know how to retrain myself to feel comfortable around people, probably because I'm always feeling like nobody likes me. I hate who I've become because I'm so awkward and quiet and never know what to say to people. I feel like the real me is in there somewhere but I just don't know how to get to her. I just kind of hate myself all the time. I have ridiculously low self-esteem. I get told I am attractive, but in a weird way that makes me feel worse, because it means there must be something seriously wrong with my personality. I feel as if people like me when they see my face but then when they talk to me for more than 5 minutes they're bound to hate me or think I'm a complete weirdo, if that makes any sense at all. I'm just extremely self-conscious about who I am as a person because it feels like I don't have whatever it is that makes other people like a person.

I'm just so bummed and blah feeling most of the time, and I don't really have anyone to talk to about it.

I want to go back to sleep when I wake up and never wake up.

People always seem to want to talk to me or be around me but I'm always so disconnected and still so alone in my mind. I'm not even sure anymore if there is a God and if there is he's a twisted MFer. Sorry for the pointless rant. Even if no one reads this it's 5 minutes of relief for me somehow."

I’m afraid if I open up once I’ll never be able to hold it together again.,"Sorry this is so deep and literally just all about my problems. But that’s what Reddit’s for I guess. Loneliness makes way for a lot of introspection.

My number one problem is that I never say what I want to say. I can’t express my feelings at all, ever. Even to myself, I rarely cry, and when I have, it has felt forced and meaningless, not relieving. I can’t fully open up to a single person in my life, so they all think I’m just level-headed (or cold to a degree). I’ve gone through two periods of depression and nobody in my life knows. I convinced myself that I’m all I need, and I do still believe that, that I don’t need the reassurance and advice from people who don’t know me as well as I know myself, but I see now that I’m self-sabotaging with my inability to let anyone in. I don’t know how to fix it and it’s driving me crazy.

So I’ve been trying to think about why I so adamantly refuse speak my feelings. And I think it’s because I’m scared, not of judgment or vulnerability, but of making my feelings real. The one person I let myself fall in love with... I told him I was in love with him and suddenly I was consumed in our feelings. Just telling him I loved him was all it took for me to find myself attached to him. He was so fucking good to me, but eventually he gave up on trying to get me to commit. And I don’t blame him.

It was when I lost him that I realized that this is exactly why I don’t open up. I’m terrified that I’m going to say one word and never be able to stop the flood of emotions that bursts out. Somehow, holding in all of my feelings one hundred percent of the time keeps them from being real. If I can just keep it all in, I can deal with it my own way without people pitying and tiptoeing around me. But simultaneously, keeping it all in sets a limit for how deeply I can connect with someone. And I’m learning this too late.

I also can't drop out and get a g.e.d cause I can't drop out in the first place. So now I'm laying on my floor thinking of the life I never had. How I'll never see my siblings grow up. And wondering if the other side is peaceful. And now I'm thinking how I need to wake up in 5 hours for school so I can continue pretending I'm ok.

Having a hard time with high school,"Hi all, I'm new to Reddit, so hopefully I'm doing this post right. 

I'm currently in one of the top high schools in my city and its extremely stressful. Everyone is constantly comparing test scores, and its hard to stand out. I've been raised to believe in an ""Ivy League or bust"" type mindset, and I'm just feeling very stressed out. I have a 4.0 GPA, but it gives me extreme anxiety just to be at school and keep up my grades. I have GAD (generalized anxiety) and some social anxiety, and to make it worse, I live in a dense city area which makes my anxiety spike. I'm very tired every day since I end up procrastinating. I don't want to do my work because it has just become tedious at this point, and just very boring. I feel like I have actually become more dumb by going to this school because I just end up learning things only to end up forgetting them. I used to love learning and reading books but now I barely have time to read anything, and even when I do have time I don't have the motivation to read anymore. I feel more grades driven than actually wanting to learn something new. I'm always incredibly discouraged when I see myself getting bad grades. Recently my grades have been on a downwards spiral and I'm getting very worried (recently I scored a 79 and 82). I've read articles that your immune system/brain growth is stunted from lack of sleep yet I can't bring myself to stop procrastinating since I'm just so stressed out and bored all the time. I feel like if I was at a ""regular"" high school I would have a lot more time to develop my interests. I feel like a mechanized robot most of the time, and always go through these depressive phases. My parents don't really acknowledge it, and didn't allow me to see a therapist until 2 years into high school. I've stopped with the therapist, because my mother has guilt tripped me about the cost of therapy, and because I get way too emotional when I talk to a therapist.

I'm very fed up with my school, and just upset with society in general. I think its very detrimental to put teenagers in such a harsh environment when their brains are still developing, and they are tying to figure out who they are. I see countless kids at my school taking stimulant/depressive drugs because they are so stressed out, and that causes permanent brain damage in some cases. I myself have horrible neurosis about everything, and push myself way past my limit all because of trying to prove to myself/parents that I can get into a great school. I would feel bad about myself if I stopped trying, but at the same time, I just want to stop everything. I really hate myself, and I just feel unconfident all the time because I'm in a family and school with amazingly brilliant, intelligent people. I just feel so inadequate and stupid all the time, and I feel like people are just judging me all the time. Every day I wake up, I'm basically just in denial about everything so I can keep going.

The depression always seeps back. How do we even manage?,"Had an amazing last couple of days. Have more fun to come tomorrow.

Depression re-emerging; what do I do?,"For a long time I’ve known I suffer with depression. As young as 9 I can remember breaking down crying in my mom’s car for reasons I couldn’t articulate to anyone. Through high school I struggled with thoughts of suicide and long periods where I couldn’t find happiness in anything. For the last 2 years, I thought I was better. I found motivation in life, made lots of friends, and had a much more optimistic attitude. Much of this (though not all) was due to the great relationships I formed in college. In the last 2 months I have lost many friends and depression has creeped its way back into the forefront of my life. I struggle to forgive myself for the smallest things and will have several hour periods where I can’t move from my couch. This affliction has only become more serious and crippling with time, although I have managed to keep my grades up and hide the fact from my family and most friends. Admittedly drugs and alcohol have played a greater role in holding this off than I’d like to admit.

I’ve considered therapy or talking to my family, but I’m ashamed. I know it’s nothing one should be ashamed of and I’d never judge someone else for their depression, but shame isn’t rational and it’s not something I can logically escape. Do you all think it’s possible to overcome this alone or with the help of a few friends or do I need professional help. I’ve never posted to a subreddit of this sort, but I’m feeling desperate and low and concerned for my long term future.

If anyone would like to reach out and talk, I’d be beyond appreciative. Thanks everyone",t2_3dsfq82u,2,0,1,"Depression re-emerging; what do I do? For a long time I’ve known I suffer with depression. As young as 9 I can remember breaking down crying in my mom’s car for reasons I couldn’t articulate to anyone. Through high school I struggled with thoughts of suicide and long periods where I couldn’t find happiness in anything. For the last 2 years, I thought I was better. I found motivation in life, made lots of friends, and had a much more optimistic attitude. Much of this (though not all) was due to the great relationships I formed in college. In the last 2 months I have lost many friends and depression has creeped its way back into the forefront of my life. I struggle to forgive myself for the smallest things and will have several hour periods where I can’t move from my couch. This affliction has only become more serious and crippling with time, although I have managed to keep my grades up and hide the fact from my family and most friends. Admittedly drugs and alcohol have played a greater role in holding this off than I’d like to admit.

I’ve considered therapy or talking to my family, but I’m ashamed. I know it’s nothing one should be ashamed of and I’d never judge someone else for their depression, but shame isn’t rational and it’s not something I can logically escape. Do you all think it’s possible to overcome this alone or with the help of a few friends or do I need professional help. I’ve never posted to a subreddit of this sort, but I’m feeling desperate and low and concerned for my long term future. I know I could survive months or even years this way, but not in a way that’s fulfilling. While this post is one asking for advice it really feels like a cry for help too. If anyone would like to reach out and talk, I’d be beyond appreciative. Thanks everyone"
I fail at everything no matter how hard I try,"I'm such a pathetic failure , no matter how easy something is I always fail and after a while usually lose my resolve and give up.

"I don’t want to be the same, I don’t want to be normal.","Normal hurts, Normal is boring. I sit in my room, alone, with my cat. I cry and hurt, yet that reminds me of who I am.

Phsycotic Break advice needed,"I like to think I’m a sane and normal person, but my life this past year has been been going into a downward spiral. It started with pressure upon graduating college and not knowing what I wanted to pursue with my career. Then my gf of 3 years broke up with me, to which we’ve been off and on in a very emotional middle ground these past few months while she’s falling in love again, but with another guy. 

I don’t feel healthy anymore. In the good old days I used to spend doing the things I love like golf, skiing, drawing, working, being with friends or my ex. Now, literal hours I sit on my butt and play video games or wallow in what my life has become and why my mind races around in circles.  

I’m failing in almost every class at school except my senior capstone project, why can’t I just keep that together for 1 more semester? I need to be working on my employment opportunities and don’t even have a place to live once my current lease ends in 3 months. I’m broke and if I don’t work up the discipline to work again I can’t pay rent for next month. 

Right now I’m pulled off the side of the highway after experiencing a psychotic break about losing my sense of personality and identity.

I’m too embarrassed to talk to family because they certainly don’t how to handle this in a loving way, and the only person Id 99% be comfortable of confessing this vulnerable position is my ex, to which I don’t want to show how poorly I truly am doing and receive care out of pity.

Finding it Hard to Keep in Regular Contact with Friends,"So, a bit of context before I begin. I recently failed my examinations that would allow me to go through to University and since then my life has kinda ground to a halt. I would say that the reason for me dropping the ball like that has something to do with my mental health, but it would be wrong of me to blame it all on that.

A lot of my friends, some of my closest in fact have gone on to Uni and are now beginning a new chapter in life, and while I'm really happy for them, I'm struggling to maintain a relationship with them.

Their Uni is halfway across the country, and doing the whole long distance friendship thing has sort of become a challenge for me, which I hate because some of these guys are a reason why I'm still around today. 

For some reason I've already started to isolate myself away from friends who are still local, which makes me feel like a dick for just slowly losing contact with people I still want to hang around with, but I just can't?? I can't really explain why, I just rarely go out anymore, and people tend to drift away when you're not making as much of an effort, which I get.

A similar thing is happening with my Uni friends, but also the fact that they're doing something and I'm not is getting to me more than I would like to admit.

I hate being like this, and I don't want to lose the connections with people that have taken multiple years to cultivate. Am I just being an asshole??

For some reason I've already started to isolate myself away from friends who are still local, which makes me feel like a dick for just slowly losing contact with people I still want to hang around with, but I just can't?? I can't really explain why, I just rarely go out anymore, and people tend to drift away when you're not making as much of an effort, which I get.

A similar thing is happening with my Uni friends, but also the fact that they're doing something and I'm not is getting to me more than I would like to admit.

I hate being like this, and I don't want to lose the connections with people that have taken multiple years to cultivate. Am I just being an asshole?? What kind of things should I do to get my drive back, because sitting at home all the time is definitely driving me insane"
Are you depressed in your dreams?,"It's weird- I've been a recovering anorexic for 7 years, and I've had depression for 4 years.

Not every dream involves it, but often within the greater plot of my dream I'll be offered food at some point and turn it down. I also have lucid dreams where, once I realize I'm dreaming, I go on insane food binges. On the flip side, I have never had depression in my dreams. I've never had a dream where I have depression thoughts, and even in my lucid dreams, I focus so much on flying or jumping off buildings or eating that it never occurs to me that I have depression.

Against time,"I constantly dream about going back in time to the age a was a little girl so I can start over and avoid my current state, cause I feel it's to like for me at 27 to improve things because I'm stuck.

"I have very little savings but won’t starve. I have a home with AC, PC, and PS4 but everyday is so tiring.","I will be 27 in this November. Along with little loans and things I finally have some savings but I can’t even encourage myself to buy one motorcycle with loan. I don’t feel like I deserve it. I have a roof on me but everything seemed so miserable. 

This is a very long story. I feel like a child crying for attention. Ashamed at the same time. But it just feels like no one understands. I had to talk. In any ways. 

I’ve always wanted a gameboy as a child. But my mom told me we were too poor to afford any. So I just watch other kids play em in break time at school. I wanted to learn music instruments but no we were too poor. 

My mom had so much expectation on me. At around 7 my mom wanted me to learn ballet. But I insisted on Piano classes. Later she compromised with GuZheng (a Chinese instrument). It was Wednesday when the first class was held. I was so eager to go. I think the tutor there even provided one free class just to see if I like it or not. 
But I didn’t go. My parents got into a pretty serious fight because of that and no one could leave the house. They used to fight so bad. At an age of capable of remembering certain events like maybe 4, my mom drank farming pesticide in a rly ugly fight. I heard it just a couple of years ago that it was not the first time. 

It just never occurred to me so clearly that I shouldn’t asked for anything else but food, shelter and school. I just never understand. (Stupid brat.)

When I get into 2nd year of jr high I really wanted to learn guitar. And I asked the money for it. They said yes. Now thinking back I guess they just don’t have the energy to talk me out of it anymore. And my dad had to work his ass off to afford even bigger bills than before. At the time, my mom slowly becoming more and more distanced. She started to be hospitalized when I was 11/12. I never understand the real reason. I only knew she needed it. My dad told me she need a lot of rest. That’s why she’s in. 

My sister was not very happy with the guitar class cuz I got what she couldn’t have. But she didn’t stop it. We had pretty bad relationship because my mom was pretty bias with me and her. She hated me for a very long time. I hated her too for being mean to me. 
Later our family had to move because a neighbor is buying off our place or simply stealing our chance to rent there I forgot and my mom or my dad wasn’t too happy about it. We moved to a crappy hole. I had to share a room with my sister and it was not very good. She basically ignored my needs. I had to get up early in the morning to go to school and she’d usually stay up very late watching movies or talk to her friends pretty loud. Or leaving the lights on. It was so bad. We shared a room for couple of years. And later we grew better with each other. But we still fight pretty often. (I moved to another room my dad build for other family members after they moved away. )

Growing up I never understood why people doesn’t like me (mostly classmates). Later on I realized I was the biggest brat in the group. I even cuss so loud at one of my best friend in front of my home teacher when I was 11. 

Guitar lesson goes on and off because of school. In the mean time I saved up money from time to time to buy a few games to play at home. And I broke our PC pretty often. It was just a office work PC. Never meant for games. 

At 16, I can’t remember where I got the money but I think I saved it up. I struggled so hard with with one. Guns N Roses was touring in Asia and to our country. I cried at school when I was looking for tickets. There was a person who wanted to get rid of some tickets in section B for personal reason. It was so cheap I felt so lucky. I cried. But because I thought I can’t go. I cannot spend money like this. This is not worth it. But.... I still went there. And I told my family I went to play basketball with my classmates. (Now I think it’s funny that no one questioned. I never stay out and play basketball. My mom would’ve thought it was weird but she was in the hospital.) I was so happy. But alone at the same time. I didn’t have dinner, only had a chocolate bar on me. I felt dizzy when jumping in the crowd. After that, I rode almost 2 hours of train ride home. I almost missed the bus to my home in my town. 

Throughout high school, my mom has been in and out of the hospital. She’d stay for one day the most, and go back to the hospital. I knew she was sick but I never knew what kind of sickness. My dad’s explanation kind of made sense but didn’t really made sense. Later I understood she had depression. But I was too dumb to see what was causing it. One time I find a jar of badly contained sleeping pills she’s been collecting. I threw them away. Angrily told her she shouldn’t do anything. She should stay alive for her family, for me. I even begged her not to die in younger age. I can’t remember when. 

I don’t visit her very often. The visiting time was limited. It never occurred to me that I could’ve visited her myself and grab food for her. I. Was. So. Much. Of. A. Brat. 
...........one time, It was midterm. We have to clear out desks. In my school, we don’t have lockers or anything and most of us tug our textbooks under a space of our desks. So I had to carry all the books home. It was heavy. And teenagers get grumpy easily. No, I was just being selfish. My dad was so busy one day he asked me to go check up my mom and I refused. Cuz the books are heavy. 
And the hospital is just 30mins away from my home. I could’ve carry the books with me and go see her. 
It felt guilty. One time I illegally rode a scooter to see her. She was worried, said I was too bald (not in happy tone. minors can’t get drivers/riders license). 

I finally graduated from sr high. My mom kind of got out the the hospital now. This time she stayed at home longer than before. She asked me out couple of times but I was too lazy and wanted to sleep more. I stayed up late and sleep throughout the day. There was one time my dad was taking her to a long time family friend. Was gonna get some meds or some nutrition shots I forgot. She asked me to come along. I said no. She begged a little and looked concerned a bit. I said no. I stayed home with my PC. 

Two weeks into the summer. It was 12 oclock in the noon. I heard my dad shouting my moms name asking her why did she do it. I was so angry and storm out the door straight into the garage. 
She effing hanged herself in the garage. Located right beside the bedroom of my sister and I. I saw her lying on the ground as my dad already got her off from the beam on the ceiling. I could not believe it. We tried CPR but none of us were trained. It was like a really bad tragic comedy that everything gets cringy. She was so cold. I knew it when I see her face. She’s not coming back. But I told my sister that mom would come back. There was a coincidence that she “visited” me in my dream when it happened. I dreamed about we finally got a house and I was so happy. I told her we finally have our own house and can live together happily, never have to worry about this crappy hole and live a better life altogether. 

Couple of months later I got into a local collage. Normal things were normal. Only I still cry almost every night. And learned how to smoke (guess I needed to feel control over something).  I cut myself sometimes. I listen to stories from my dad how bad their relationship was. It was okay at the start. Later I realized he kept victimizing himself. Kept saying how much of a psycho my mom was. Everything was just toxic. Them tearing each other apart and killing each other without physical weapons.  

It was bad. That is true. But my dad plays some major parts too. Slowly some regular relatives stopped speaking to us. Cuz shit was just so bad. He blamed my mom’s death on one of my second aunt. The third aunt is basically another selfish and ungrateful brat. And the kids (cousins) never talked to us anymore after the funeral. They said would help if we needed anything but my dad had to held up a show and that’s it. Only some kids from first aunt would show slight friendliness only in biggest holiday of the year. 

Everything is so broken. I was in the hole for so many years. I feel like I had to listen to him or he’s gonna get sick too. Yet it’s so heavy at the same time. I am so tired. 

When I got home just earlier this evening, my dad told me he hit someone’s scooter in the back this morning. Paid a lot of money. I didn’t wanted to step into another hole again and basically said at least you’re safe. And I just couldn’t stop my mouth and had to tell him that he should call the cops next time (though I hope there isn’t another time). And he said “it wont help anyways”. He says that to a lot of things. He had to have a way of dealing with things himself. It has driven me crazy so many times. 

I don’t think I can take it anymore. But I can’t abandon him. And my sister basically can’t do shit. She’s 34. The three of us bought a car and a house altogether and it’s all under her name. She’s needy and emotional. Can’t be blamed or the whole family would be on fire. Can’t argue things with her if she think it’s right. Can’t disrespect her or she’d drive the car and run away. Don’t know if she’s gonna kill herself. I had a fight with her and she had to block me on Instagram and disconnect photos on apple clouds. (Shouldn’t even kept using her ID in the first place, should’ve been more independent on my part....) 

I can’t see points. I don’t know how to make this stop. 
I finally bought a PC of my own in 2016 and a PS4 last summer. I know money can’t buy happiness. I tried to love some people in my life but I always picked the wrong person and don’t love the ones who possibly really loves me. I have been abandoned by “friends” for being such a bad person. Now there are people who seemed to care about me but I don’t think it’s good to burden them for being friends with them. And every one has their own shit to deal with. I am so self absorbed. I am a bad listener. I am the worst person. I am like this since jr high. My family is a pile of sand no one cares about each other and I and the worst among them all cuz I complain about them I can’t get my shit together. But it feels like no one listens. I should help myself getting out of this I know how but why is it so painful. I’m so numb sometimes but I’m so sad. I need it to stop.

Die from the sky in small plane,"So I'm 48. Very successful. Attractive. Married. Wife adores me but I have no feelings for her or anything. I've been depressed my entire life. Tried all the doctors with their pharma anti depressants. Even tried recreational drugs to get by these last 10 years.. Helped till tolerance buil3and they stopped working. 

No kids and no parents to worry about. No real friends. Depression just ruined this life. Thsts all. I accept it. Some people get cancer or other illness and pass away. 

When I was 12 years old I was  interested in airplanes. Dad was a aerospace engineer. He's gone 20 years.

I have been very successful. Own my own home outright in California and many rental properties. Net worth around 10 million.. Money never made me happy. Once bought a  Lamborghini on a whim thinking it would bring joy but didn't so I kept in garage 3 years then sold it. I have no desire. No interest in sex. Had opportunity for other women but no desire. 

Im not like the story of a, loser that feels unloved or inferior so that's why he hates his life . I quite love myself and have been told I'm very attractive. So I got all this good going for me but my brain is sick with depression. Depression is a  slow painfull tortured existence. Only the depressed can understand. 

I guess it's like any other illness just mental and goes on and on. Better to get cancer and die than suffer from depression for 20 years.

I've decided I don't wanna live much longer with this illness. I don't wanna be found hanging in a garage or something unpleasant like an overdose or gunshot and those methods are not 100%
So I'm gonna take 2 years and get my private pilots license. Thrn either just buy a, small plane go for a solo flight. Maybe take some pills and alcohol to numb myself then crash into a hillside or mountain.

This way people will say he died doing something he loved. He died with passion. That's better than being remembered as a loser that hung himself in his garage

I screwed up really bad with my social/career life and now do not see meaning in keep living,"A little bit of context (And just because I need to vent overall): I am a college student (Seventh semester out of 10). Up until last year, I was one of the best of the entire country and was a successful student. I was constantly stressed out, depressed and close to a total burnout, but my results were outstanding nonetheless.  
Until, last year, I tried to cheat some exams. I still do not know if I did this out of sheer lack of motivation or because I wanted to keep my image of a good student intact (Aka pure pride), but in my mind cheating was better than getting low grades. Anyway, it did not end up okay as one of my teachers found out and I confessed my crime. As a punishment, I was suspended for a whole academical term (Fall 2019).  


I got so anxious about everyone finding out about the cheating that I made a cover-up story about a travel I would go and because of that I would be away from college during a term. Long story short, everyone found out about that lie (I am not a good liar), and now my reputation is destroyed. Everyone thinks I am this liar/cheater, and when I went back to college earlier this month, people look past me and pretend I don't even exist. I feel SO alone and useless, and I cannot even feel bad about myself because that is all my fault: I am the bad guy, the villain, and I am suffering the consequences of my act.  


But the truth is I... do not like my past enough to have motivation to work on my future. I feel so hopeless about my future. I should gather motivation to revert this whole situation, but I still feel so... tired. TBH, I've thought about killing myself a lot in these past months, but the only thing keep me going is the small hope that I will graduate next year and then get a job overseas, only to never look at my past again and start fresh. But I fear I am not strong enough to go through these 2 years before graduation or even running from my past the rest of my life.

Just wanted to know I'm not alone,"In the process of my depression, I'd ignored it for a while. I'd wanted to commit suicide since I was 12(I just turned 24) and I dealt with so much anxiety since then. I thought the thoughts were normal. I thought depression was just sadness. I drove myself to create a wall around that darkness to keep it out. But I couldn't. When I graduated, and my routine was about to change, I crumbled. But no one noticed. They thought I just wasn't ready for school.  I told a doctor, but I wasn't ready to accept depression. I went to a psychiatrist and therapist who messed me up more. I refused therapy when I went to a new facility, but my nurse clinician, she became worried. She wanted me to talk to someone. 

It took me breaking down and going to the psych ward in the hospital when I was 22 to see that I wasn't getting better. I got a therapist and honestly she's the best thing to ever happen. But the clinician I came to like, ended up leaving. 

I wasn't okay with male clinicians because my first psychiatrist and therapist were male and didn't help. I freaked out. I cried. Because that was all they had. Him and I we butt heads. I know what I don't want to do, he wants to make me take it because it worked for his other patients. I've been through 19 different medications from the span of 2018-1019. I only take duloxetine and valium now. But I'm not better by any means. I just know what to do. I got good at hiding it. But my therapist knows. I'm not okay.

The one question I wanted to know, was have any of you created an entity out of your depression/mental disorders(I do suffer from GAD, Social Anxiety, Major Depression with Psychosis, OCD and PTSD). I know he's not real. His name's Shadow. I saw a program that said depressives can create their own entities out of depression, but it's a ghost show.

I am going to bring this up with my therapist and doctor, but also wanted to ask the sub. Last week I experienced a minor depressive episode. Episodes happen about once a month. I was stuck in bed for two days and didn't eat. Towards the end of the second day, my friend dragged me out of bed and to a social event. I mostly just stood around and didn't talk to anyone. On my drive home I cried in frustration over being stuck in bed and how everyone else at the event was having fun and enjoying themselves. The next few days though I had a weird swing in emotions. I jumped out of bed early the next day and was doing chores and even exercised. I was laser focused at work.

Does anyone else experience these swings? It's like the clouds have opened up and I have clarity.",t2_k9gdn,10,0,1,"Post Depressive Episode Highs TL;DR does anyone else experience moments of focus and clarity the days following a depressive episode?

"I am sick, sleep deprived, empty, and low","This is the worst time of year for me because it signifies the beginning of yet another summer, another year, in which I am a loser and my life is subpar. I am disappointed with my low quality of life, I am regretful of the choices I have made, and I am ashamed of the essence of my being.

I don't believe I will ever catch up to where I wanted to be, nor that I will ever recover from the fall I took following my endless blunders. I am one of the most stupid people I know. I look back in disgust at the decisions I made, the worhtless trivialities I prioritized, the lack of discipline I did not address.

I don't know what is left for me. I am unemployed, without an ideal family unit, without social support, without any fulfillment or even hobbies whatsoever. I see others live out my dreams and I think to myself ""I am not worthy of doing those things because I am too stupid and weak, and I have made a proper mess of things.""

"My friends have all moved on and I haven’t, and it’s killing me.","So I’ll try to make this as brief as possible. 

Basically I have always had friends that were 5 years or more older than I. About 4-5 years ago I moved into a house with two of my best friends. Like we were super close. Every night was filled with cooking dinner, enjoying drinks, weekends going out, etc. we were inseparable at that time. We did this for about 2.5 years. And it was arguably the best times of my life. Those guys will always be brothers to me. 

Well once our last lease was up, one guy informed me he was moving away to be with his new gf (whom I love) in a city four hours away, and the other guy was getting his own place by himself for himself and his future wife. I didn’t think anything of it, I went ahead and bought my own house and all was good. Once in my new house my mom suddenly died at 53, then three months later my step dad and then a year after that my dog of 10 years died. (Maybe this is important idk)

So here I am, two years from when we all moved out. Finding all my friends have moved on. And I have no friends interested in dinner parties or going out. I have friends but then I find myself being super clingy, basically asking them to do something everyday. Which just annoys them to no end and they eventually just don’t want to hang out. 

I find it so incredibly difficult to cope with this loneliness, I know it’s nothing compared to some people, but being social was such a big part of my life, and now I feel like I just have nothing. Just this empty house and me sitting on the couch literally staring out my living room window as Netflix softly plays in the background. Just wondering what I’m doing with my life or whatever.

I can't help my cartoonish friend,"I have a friend who's attached themself to me. This has basically happened all my life. I attract younger brothers and I don't know why. 

We met online and are on opposite sides of the country (US.) He's a total teddy bear of a guy. He loves cute things and generally acting cute. He likes to roleplay and is often flirty. We bonded over our similar taste in men (we're both dudes, but I'm bi and he's mostly gay.) After I made it clear I'm not interested in dating him, he's mostly been talking about other guys he's got the hots for, which I'm comfortable with. He still flirts, but it's died down to ""have I mentioned I'm gay today"" kinda stuff, not the serious flirting we started out with. We have no mutual friends or even acquaintances, and I don't think he has that many people there for him in his life. I honestly do like him most of the time, and my life would be much lonelier without him. 

He's clearly suffering from depression. Sometimes, he flips like a switch into absolute nihilism. He honestly sounds like lyrics from a metal album sometimes. He's clearly calling for help and clearly thinks I can give that. 

But the thing is, I can't. 

I've tried listening and being supportive, but it always grows into apocalyptic kind of stuff and how he wants the whole world to be destroyed or politicians to all die or something. It's always vague stuff, no concrete threats. I think it's just finding solace in being an edgelord. 

But it's really disturbing to me. He's normally a teddy bear. It's really toxic. I'm afraid it will turn into actual threats if he doesn't get help and I don't know how to defuse it. Anytime I try to push back on these malevolent rants, I become the enemy and it turns into a huge fight. 

And I know it sounds super cartoonish, but it's really painful for me. 

I've set boundaries-- no sociopathic talk about killing the world or the streets running with blood. But he ignores that. 

I've tried telling him he needs to seek professional help, but if he's in a rant, psychologists just become another antichrist. He was a open to the idea for the first couple months, but ever since, he's just gotten more and more anti-psych ever since talking to *one* volunteer on the first website he found. 

Just now, he turned from happy and enjoying working on something to completely deflated with no obvious trigger. And I'm just staring at this wall of chats coming in a message every few minutes basically saying ""help me."" 

And I'm *not* helping him. I'm not even talking to him. I don't know how to help him. I can't patiently listen--it turns violent. I can't set boundaries--he ignores them. I can't send him to informal or formal help, because I have nobody to send him to/no one he trusts. And I really don't want to block him. 

He just spirals through it for a while and eventually snaps out of it. But what if he doesn't? I feel like there's nothing I can do for him, but if I do nothing...

I feel responsible for his well being, which I know is wrong. I feel like if I block him, I've failed him and myself.

I just don't feel anything maybe that is an unhealthy coping mechanism. I also ruminate a lot, i really can't remember when i was happy last time. My father is like always ashamed of me but i don't care about that but he is an abusive father. If he wants to get something done he will threathen to kill himself and beat himself...

I live at a hostel and a person just became my friend so he could be at studies but i guess everyone makes friends out of mutual interest(maybe).

People always dismiss it as a personality quirk. Also i get irritated and angry very quickly. I was bullied and i never stood up for myself. Because i was slapped by sister i front of my class when i was in 7 grade because a ""friend"" said that i was disturbing him which was completely false and i was just crushed. He was just torturing me because i didn't gave him video games and movies because my computer was damaged but he wouldn't believe it. Also i was beaten by a 17/18 old when i was in 8rd grade. I was teased my whole life by everyone(even my own family). I felt miserable everywhere. Because of this i have anxiety of everything that is social. I feel very awkward, at one time i even felt like i couldn't order my food. Because i have picked up some weird quirks like raising my eyebrows all the time, talking strangely, walking while dragging my feet, i felt like my mouth wouldn't move while talking. I was insulted constantly. I have tried to change myself by becoming more acccepting of myself, having a good diet, exercise more but my brain still wasn't working that good. I realised that i took much more time than my peers to understand stuff. I was planning to giving more time to doing stuff that i am good at. Becoming more better at what i could do. But my parents didn't support me and i felt totally crushed. I guess i didn't plan it though. My good grades weren't able to pursuade them. I should have put a much better performance to convince them, try to put that thought in their head from a long time etc. But whenever i tried to talk to them they said to talk after the exams. I relapsed to my old hateful, digusting habits. I feel like i just can't do it alone but in my society there is so stigma on mental health that if i seek help people will think that i am insane. And i did seek help, the doctor said i needed therapy and some medications. But everyone in my family was like no he was born gullible, stupid, sad and he is just making this stuff. So i didn't took treatment. Also i am mostly uncertain and i isolated myself many times.

When i watch tv shows or talk to people i can't understand what are they saying. I have trouble following up when sometimes people explain stuff. I have trouble looking at people when talking to them i guess i just stare at them or i feel like they are judging me or judge me. I have so many bad memories of so many people that i just hate most of them. I am sad most of the time and i don't look like it but my laughter doesn't look natural. I just don't feel anything maybe that is an unhealthy coping mechanism. I also ruminate a lot, i really can't remember when i was happy last time. My father is like always ashamed of me but i don't care about that but he is an abusive father. If he wants to get something done he will threathen to kill himself and beat himself...

My parents don’t take me seriously,"It was hard enough to tell them and I didn’t plan to, it only happened bc u had a mental breakdown bc I had to go to school. Anyways they may be really supportive and my mom tries to find psychologist but I think she doesn’t take me seriously. She always leave comments like ,,Just fix your sleep, everything will change” or ,,If it’s just that we don’t need a psychologist.”

Today I told her that I can’t study it’s just not possible that’s why I want to go to a dancing school and she said ,,You still have 2 months everything will get better then”

What do you do when your depression starts to show in a relationship?,"I'm in a relationship and I can feel what is happening as it has happened many times in the past. I feel like a lie. My depression controls my life but if I keep people at a distance, I can feign normality. I can hide away the days I just lie for 16 hours not eating not sleeping but paralysed by indifference and apathy.

But I can also be fine on some days. I can be charming, passionate, full of care and love. But it's a deception. I am not this lovely person who has occasional depressed days. I am the depression who can sometimes manage to be the most caring ball of sunshine. The two live side by side - the emptiness that looms fuels the longing for something real. It makes me care deeply about others whilst I am unable to care for myself.

So, I meet someone and they see those sparse moments of passion. They see the slight rays of sunshine amongst a cloud of darkness. But all they see of me is the sunshine, so they perceive me as that sunshine. Then, as it gets deeper, the facade drops and I can't feign normality. The reality of what I am and who I am comes through. But they don't see that. As the commitments grow deeper and the time we spent together grows, they start to see the clouds and they don't realise they were always there. They think the clouds have just appeared and it means I don't care about them. They don't understand why I've suddenly become like this. I can't explain myself anymore, I don't want to go through that same conversation where I explain my depression and it feels like it will never make me good enough. But then, I'm left just saying ""I don't know why I wasn't available, I don't know why bla bla, I can't explain why I didn't respond then"" when I just want them to leave me alone because I will never be enough. I didn't stop caring, I haven't stopped feeling. I just got too close and they realised how empty I was.

What do you do when you get to that point? I don't want my depression to be someone else's burden to bear.",t2_17cq8u,2,0,1,"What do you do when your depression starts to show in a relationship?

Depressive episode bc of school,I have been so stressed out lately.. my best friend left me for someone who hates me and it messed me up so much. I'm in a group with them for a school project since 5 weeks. We should've presented it last week but I just called in sick.. I still dont have all of my work done and because of that the one person screamed at me. I know it's my own fault but all this stress is too much and when I think of school I'm getting so sick and I wanna throw up. I'm still not going to school and my mother doesn't know. I haven't showered for a week and my room is messier than normally. I feel so dumb and pathetic. I feel like everyone is leaving me. I only have one friend left but she is going to another school.. wow. My problems aren't big at all. I'm just a sensitive crybaby.

I feel like a lost cause mentally,"To be honest, I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe it could be a good way of recognising my own issues. I’m male (20) and am struggling with depression and my adaption into adulthood. I’ve always been a shy quiet guy, but after I’ve left high school this seems to have gotten way worse. In my job, I’m surrounded by people twice my age, which I don’t actually mind. It doesn’t have the pressure to fit in, as I’m already the youngest there by a mile. I struggle with speaking to people my own age, especially girls. 

I did have a few struggles with drugs such as coke and weed, but I thought if I kicked these my mood would improve. Things have been slightly better since I stopped these, but I wouldn’t say my mood has significantly improved.

Since I’ve started to take notice of my depression, I have noticed some side effects that I’d rather live without, these include:

• Regularly forgetting words whilst speaking to people. I’ll be telling a story and suddenly I’ll forget a word that is pivotal to the story I am telling. This is so annoying as it makes me appear like an idiot with no vocabulary.

• Nervousness. This has been particularly bad recently. I’m not talking the type of nervousness you’d get before sky diving. I get nervous if I’m walking into a shop or cafe I haven’t been in before. I get nervous whilst speaking on the phone to people at my work, to the point where I don’t answer sometimes and rely on email.

• I’ve become a people pleaser in the worst sense. It’s not even that I particularly want to make everyone happy, I just say what people want to hear sometimes to make my day easier and avoid difficult conversations.

•This is something recent, but a few people have picked up on it. I struggle with eye contact, I finds it awkward and I’m not sure why. One of my friends compared it to speaking with a blind person before. (This wasn’t to be mean btw)

•I become infatuated with any woman my age who shows me the smallest bit attention (came to realise this once I heard Jim Carrey say it in a film). I’ve never been able to form a relationship with someone before, and I feel the longer it takes, the worse this is going to get.

• I feel uncomfortable being in a crowd of people. Like if I’m at a social gathering, if I’m in a conversation with a big group of people I feel pressured to contribute which makes me feel nervous and run off.

These are just a few of the things I have noticed. I’m thinking of seeing a therapist, but I live in Scotland and to be honest I don’t know if therapy isn’t just for rich people in Hollywood. I do have friends, but I only have one true friend I speak to everyday. The rest are people I went to school with and I don’t feel I particularly fit in with them anymore. Not saying they are bad people, but I can feel me drifting away from them. I have thought about suicide, but I wouldn’t want to put that emotional strain on my family. I wouldn’t say I want kill myself. But if I learned by some magic that I was going to die next week, I wouldn’t put up much of a fuss.

Thanks for reading if you’ve made it this far. I just thought I would write some of this down to see if I could recognise some of my own problems on my own. It has been quite therapeutic actually. If anyone else is struggling with any of this, I’m happy to chat.",t2_5vs98rdk,3,0,1,"I feel like a lost cause mentally To be honest, I don’t know why I’m writing this.

Blown away by literal abscence of good in my mind,"After not being able to sleep as 1 AM approaches, I feel that there is not a single place in my mind I can direct my thoughts into in order to calm down, in order to feel safe, to feel that I matter, to feel I have personality, to feel I have anything that defines a  living human being.

I have just realized this, after observing that every time new thought forms in my mind, it is a negative thought. Negative past experience, negative fake scenarios, self doubt thoughts.

I tried to look for even a single thought that would make me relatively calm but failed. And this is not embelishment.

I have AvPD and severe lack of sense of self. 

I feel better writing this down and sharing it. 

I can not stress enough how important a reply is for me. I can not help myself on my own. 

There is nothing I strive for. Literally. I am just piece of meat that is scared to die. I have no life.

The idea of ending things is all that makes me feel okay anymore(TW),"My meds stopped working. I’m always sad. Or numb. All I’ve managed to do is fuck my life up beyond belief in the last year and now I have nothing and nobody. I have no friends. The family that was still talking to me basically made it clear they only did so because of my last suicide attempt. I fucked up every romantic situation to come in my life and hurt the one person I actually care about. All I do is fuck up and hurt people. 
Lately, most of my thoughts have been about hurting myself. I started self harming again and I’ve been thinking about taking harder drugs again, too. My life and everything in it feels empty and I can’t be bothered to care about myself anymore. 

When I think about ending it I just feel really calm. Like if I did it, everything would finally be over. I wouldn’t have to live through it anymore. I used to have a hard time with it. When I first started thinking about suicide(about 7 years ago at around age 12), there was a sense of distress that accompanied it. It would happen during panic attacks or really bad nights. I’d think about all the people I needed to say goodbye to and that would stop me. Now, when I think about going back to the same bridge from last time and being done with it, I feel relieved. I realized I cause more problems than I ever mean to, and if I weren’t around, that would stop. 

I think I’m going to do it soon. I need this to be over.

10 years later,"After 10 years of feeling like something isnt right, I finally was diagnosed with depression and anxiety today.

I was on the fence because at first the symptoms were only felt every few days a month. I remember being 14 and accepting the fact that I was going to kill myself, but I was just waiting for the right moment. Yet throughout the years I still pushed it away as me only having the occasional bad day or feeling hormonal cuz of puberty. Since I could still get out of bed in the morning to do stuff and I wasnt self-harming (in the traditional way people tend to think of), I figured I was just being dramatic or looking for attention. 

Fast forward to today, and Im at the point where waking up everyday is just exhausting. Having to do this daily; putting on a smiling face when deep down I feel like a shell of a person. Struggling to pay attention in a 1 hour lecture. Sitting down to do homework and ending up not doing anything. Falling behind with no motivation to do better, and every day asking myself ""why am I even still here? Whats the point?""

I used school to get good grades and in return felt validated by the school, peers, and parents. I don’t consider myself a smart person, but have always been driven to get the best grades I could get so that I could feel that sense of validation.

depressions a bitch,nobody told me that you have highs when you get happy and then go back into depression.

How I'm feeling.,"So alot of times I feel good. I don't really sleep well but I never did, and I am really really skinny. I don't really eat all that much. It's never really bothered me. I'm graduating soon and I'm moving out of my fraternity house. Hopefully I'll start eating and sleeping better. Be a healthy productive member of society.

But sometimes, something happens and I just spiral into thoughts of oh I'm not good enough or smart enough blah blah.

Alot of times it's girl related, I've never been in a relationship and I'm 22, being in college and in a frat and seeing everyone else doing that really sucks.

Sometimes it's school related, unused to want to get my masters in accounting and I changed my mind for alot of reasons, mostly I don't want to be a CPA, and I'm doing a bachelor's degree and getting regular job.

There's other stuff too, maybe it's being skinny, maybe it's me feeling like my friends don't like me even though they do, maybe it's x maybe it's y. But it's always a spiral and idk how to stop it.

And like I said, most of the time I feel good. This weekend was pretty bad but tommorow feels like it'll be a good day unless something bad happens.

Idk what I really expected to get out of this post. And I really think it'll be better come may when I have that change of pace and scenery. It just feels like forever away.

Die drowning in the beach,"I listen to tango. This specific tango always comforts me, it has something warm about it. I have rarely felt comfortable. Life has been more discomfort. Perhaps that is why Argentina enchanted me and enchants me today. Tango brings me comfort, it brings me heat: why wouldn't Argentina (or Uruguay) have the same effect?

I'm still lonely. I continue a thousand things. But now I'm a freshman of Portuguese Literature at the glorious Federal University of Santa Catarina. I care about rankings so I went to see where the little princess of Trindade was and we are (we are? I'm hardly a freshman) the twenty-second in Latin America. I remained sad. Perhaps rankings are not that important.

I thought maybe I was going to be hospitalized last week. Fortunately, I wasn't. Because I tried to kill myself recently, they infer that soon I will have to try again. The psychiatrist did not want to leave the medication with me. I said that I wasn't crazy about trying something new with medication. I have the recipes.

I don't even know more than to complain. Yes, I am lonely. I've always been lonely. I didn't have most of the experiences of an ordinary teenager. I have a few friends. I never went to their homes. Maybe I don't have friends. My family is dysfunctional and I learned what suicide means from an early age. I talked to my mom last week and I almost had an anxiety attack.

I tried to contact almost everyone. It was not a success. I felt even more lonely.

Things should have improved. I moved to another city. I recited my poems at a bar. I'm almost a college student now. But now I can only remember that once an Australian Prime Minister went to dive into the sea and never came back. And I think it’s not that unusual.

Depression has made my life so unstable for 5 years...But with Wellbutrin and a supportive employer I'm having a turn around!,"TL;DR You should try some kind of treatment for your depression and anxiety, and let your employer know what you deal with. It is helping me immensely.   


I dropped out of school 3 years into a math degree at a research level university after sudden onset of extreme hypochondria which has led to sustained anxiety and depression.   


5 years later I am 4 online classes away from a trash degree from university of phoenix online. I've coped with anxiety/depression with alcohol, gambling, sexual thrill seeking, years long video game binges, and overeating. This led to a bankruptcy, over 30 different jobs in the last 5 years(most lasting less than 1 month) I've spent more time unemployed than employed in this time period by far.  


I lie to my wife about my unhealthy habits. I tell her I'm going to work, when I'm going to a casino. I tell her I'm hanging out at a park when I'm getting shitfaced at a strip bar(then eventually kicked out). My life is just riddled with bullshit stupid things I do to try to feel better.

The first time I actually tried an antidepressant was about a month and a half ago(cymbalta) which made me manic and unable to feel my penis during sex. I switched to wellbutrin after a week long bender that ended with my parents finding my lame 28 year old ass sleeping in my car outside the local indian casino with a pile of wine bottles in the passenger seat.   


The wellbutrin has been hit and miss so far, it gave me a lot more energy and motivation sometimes, but sometimes I just feel like I'm paralyzed stuck in a dark spot. I've also had much less negative thoughts on this medicine. 

Right now I'm sitting on 2 and a half weeks with a new job as a business to business salesperson. During the interview for this job was the first time I EVER had an employer ask me if I dealt with a disability that could effect my performance. He has shown empathy ever since I mentioned it and tried to support me and make sure I'm feeling ok throughout my time I've worked with him. I REALLY HOPE I CAN KEEP THIS JOB! 

Having a job like this helps me feel some purpose in my life. Something that has been missing for a long time. I am finally feeling motivated and confident for the first time in ages. I walk into businesses and lay my balls on the front desk. I've had some success and that is thrilling. The flurry of ""We will call you if we need you""s and other rejections haven't fazed me thus far.  


I wish I hadn't been scared to try an antidepressant 5 years ago, and I wish I would have told my employers the living hell I live with.

Advice on how to get help,"Hello, about two years ago I went through a seriously traumatic situation and I've had to continue experiencing it in a lesser way. Basically now my ex husband who brutalized me took my daughter and I rarely get to see her. I'm not here for custody advice, I just think it needs to be explained as to why I can't change my situation much.

I went to my doctor about a year ago and asked for help with my anxiety and depression that's just gotten worse and worse as time goes on, very much relating to the situation with my daughter. He recommended therapy. He didn't want To give me anything. I started seeing a therapist weekly. It helped some for awhile but a couple months ago I started really slipping again. I now feel I'm at a point where I can't hold myself up. I've expressed this to my husband. He's supportive but he can't help me much other than push me back to the doctor. I had to switch clinics because of my insurance. This doctor also doesn't want to give me anything. She just wants me to keep trying therapy.

I'm not really sure how to make them listen to me. I've told them I was traumatized. I've told them how bad my depression is. I've told them I'm barely functional right now. What do I do?

"I need some advice people, please..","Hello, I've dealt with anxiety (mainly health anxiety) for the past **months.** I've reached this point that I've finally beat it (couple of weeks ago) , meaning that I stopped worrying about issues and start enjoying stuff more. One day at a time and I was finally starting to get my energy/strength back , to start attending my University again (2nd year) and start producing music again.

2 weeks ago , 4th semester started. I already had random moments in my day , especially after a good meal , that I felt a bit sleepy, but since I was done with looking up sh\*t online and had **no** other weird symptoms I decided that's it's nothing serious. It's Monday and I get ready to get back at it and try my best and be as productive as possible etc. without overdoing it obviously. Again, one day at a time.

But, something was completely off. Seriously. I felt sleepy, tired, fatigued , weak , bored. I can't even describe the feeling I felt those days. It got a bit better but I can tell you the situation is pretty much the same for 2 weeks. I don't have any other issues. I am 19 and had some blood work done today. Results will be ready tomorrow. (I do them on March every year). 

The other mental thing I feel is like a brain fog thing, when I have to do something I feel like I will lift 10.000 KGs on my back. My upper body feels...I don't know , sore? Weak? Tired? Bored? Again I can't find the right words. There are moments that I feel great , but if I hear, feel or see something that I dislike to hear/feel or see I instantly start feeling like cr@p. Tired etc. I can't really describe you the situation.

Oh and since I've dealt with health anxiety and know pretty much all health conditions that exist. I've convinced myself without knowing it that I have cancer or multiple sclerosis/ALS. 

**My question to you is..** Do you feel the same? Could I have a mild form of depression? I feel lost, tired and emotionally drained. Instead of feeling afraid I feel nothing, I feel like I have destroyed my body's neurological system/adrenal glands. This sucks hard time.

How do I deal with that I will never have a girlfriend?,"My ideal dream, even now, is to have a girlfriend and someday marry her, start a family and have a child. I've always been by pure nature a very sincere, affectionate, fun, funny but focused person at the same time, attentive, who knows how to listen and that I know that if a single girl deigned to know me even if it's a bit I know that she'd like me.

However, I know that I'll never ever get anything similar in my whole life and it's doomed to loneliness. And this isn't something that I just believe, I know perfectly. Among other things, because I'm not from the USA or the American continent and things in my country in particular are very different since here there are NO attentive girls directly, only the superficiality is undeniably the order of the day (and where I don't leave winning)

In addition, to all this is added the fact that I don't like to go out there and I find it extremely barbaric to speak a single syllable before a woman.

And even then, even knowing this and accepting it, I have a hard time assimilating it and that all the years that I still have left of life will be monotonous one after the other mired in total solitude, because I don't even have a single female friend nor does it seem that I'm going to have (although I don't have so many male friends too).

High-functioning denial. How do you ask for help?,"I've had depression since I was a teenager. It's a lot more under control now that I'm in my late 20's, but a few days a week it'll hit me again. I've seen counselors before. Latest one for about a year and a half. They've helped, but I get so mad at myself because I feel like I can't beat this. I feel like I am so fortunate to have the resources and support that I have, so it makes me feel more ashamed that I can't take advantage of those things and help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm back in college after a long hiatus, and the depression has really been interfering. I have identified this pattern: A bad thought comes, triggering self-doubt and self-loathing. This can lead to suicidal thinking and isolating myself to a point where I become sort of paralyzed and I hate myself so much I don't want to tell anyone what's going on. I just want myself to suffer. I doubt my ability to even attempt, much less complete my schoolwork. Even simple assignments or filling out simple forms. So I end up delaying and procrastinating to avoid the fear that I won't do a good enough job. Then I end up missing the deadline, and then I skip class. I tell myself I'll catch up and turn it in at the next class session, but I almost never do. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I feel embarrassed to go to that next class without the assignment completed, and I tell myself I'll do it by the next class. But then I feel so angry with myself for not doing it, and for being lazy and procrastinating and getting into this situation again. Then I try to work on it, but I'm not satisfied with my attempt, so I put it away, frustrated. This happens over and over again, and meanwhile, of course, I'm missing class and missing all the new assignments, and falling behind in one class affects my attitude about my other classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I know my situation is not that bad. Other people have it much worse. I feel so guilty and ashamed for struggling with this for so long. I've had to push my graduation back so many times, and my parents have been footing the bill. I know there are people who can't even afford to go to college, or they have to take out a loan for it. I'm lucky, and I'm wasting the opportunity I have because I can't get my act together.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying and I have been trying, but I think one of the major things holding me back is my hesitation to ask for help. I am usually the person that other people go to for help and advice. I seem confident and I am a natural leader. People like me and feel comfortable around me, and I really genuinely care about others. I try to help people as often as I can, and it makes me feel good to be there for others, even if it's just to put my arm around their shoulder or just show them that I'm listening.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason, I don't allow myself that same comfort. It's almost like I stop myself from having that connection with others. I don't know how to let people comfort me. I feel ashamed and I feel like they will be mad at me and disappointed in me if they knew how much I'm struggling with something that it seems like everyone else is able to handle. I feel that way a lot with my mom and dad, like they are frustrated with me for not being over this after so long.

&amp;#x200B;

I am lucky to have several close friends. Even though they don't have depression or other mental health issues, they really care about me and want to help me. They are always willing to listen and support me, and if they're busy, they try to help as much as they can in whatever capacity they can. I just feel so ashamed for asking them for help. Every now and then, I distance myself from my friends, and I deny that anything is wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone around me sees a lot of potential in me. It feels very heavy. When I'm able to lift my head above water, I have so much energy and I am working on different projects and leading volunteer committees and trying to make a positive difference, and I feel good about myself. But the rest of the time, I feel like I will never be able to do what I really want to do because of this recurring depression.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with my classes. It's not hard. It's not impossible. And I do believe in a higher power. I believe that God can do anything and He can make things easy for people. But with that, I also believe that people have to trust Him and put in the effort to try to help themselves. Even then, the outcome might not always be what they expect, but at least they have tried.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I feel like I don't care about myself enough to really try. I feel like giving up. People expect so much from me, and I feel like -- without bragging or being pompous -- I could really do something good and beneficial if I were able to get through this and learn to lean on my friends for support.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like because I'm able to hide it well and because I am generally confident and a leader, it doesn't seem like there really is a problem. I have frequent suicidal ideation, but my religious beliefs have always kept me from acting on them. As much as I hate reaching out for help, I still see value and purpose in my life, so I've been able to tell people when I reach that point. I've never been hospitalized, I don't drink or use drugs, I am not violent or angry, I don't physically harm myself.

 

So I feel embarrassed to talk about how depression is affecting me, because I know other people have it much worse. Most of the time I can act like I'm fine. I'm good at denying things to myself and to others. People look at me and they think I have it all together. I don't want to complain to anyone about my issues, because to me it looks like most of my problems stem from my own lack of ability to cope properly. I'm going to a therapist and we've talked about this over and over and over, so I feel that at this point, I really should be able to take steps to help myself.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for 7 years now, it's only getting worse. I feel like a failure. I'm 19, and I have achieved literally nothing so far. I'm basically studying to be a cashier, in my country we have a special high school for that. And if you want to graduate, you need to work almost 700 hours in a grocery shop, clothing shop etc. I can't work because of my depression and anxiety, I always feel like my co-workers and the customers hate me, I also know that a lot of them talk sh* about me behind my back. Some days I can't even leave my bed or house, I feel so miserable. I really wanna finish school, get a job and move out, to make my mom proud. But I can't, and I hate myself for it. I feel like sh* cause she has to cook for me, clean the house, basically do EVERYTHING around the house, and I'm just sitting there doing nothing. I just want to get my sh* together, but it seems impossible. Sometimes I actually feel good for a few days, thinking to myself 'finally'...but then depression hits me all of a sudden again, and I can't do anything but cry cause I'm literally a burden to my poor mother...my only real friend is my brother, who has recently moved out like 2 months ago..and I miss him so bad 24/7, I feel so alone..We used to chill together, play videogames, we basically did everything together...and I fricking miss that. :(
I am currently on antidepressants, but they aren't helping..they just keep giving me bad headaches and nausea.
I also hate the way I look. I feel like the ugliest person, there is literally nothing I like about myself. Not even one thing. And it's not a good feeling to look in the mirror and hate what you see. I don't know what to do. People are saying I'm weird cause I rarely talk, but I just hate myself so much, that I started thinking ""Who would even want to know what a weirdo like me has got to say?"". So I keep quiet and it's making things worse..
Also lost quite a lot of friends, cause I don't reply to their messages..I just can't understand why someone would care about a failure like me. I always think that they secretly hate me and that I'm doing them a favor by not replying to their texts. I fail at every single thing I do, I'm useless. I can't even think straight anymore.

Fu#k Happiness,"We are not meant to be happy all of the time, or most of the time, or a fair bit of the time.

We are meant to feel bad when bad things happen. And even when good things happen we have evolved to keep an eye out for potential bad things that could threaten us.

Buy this new house and you will be happy. Buy this new game and you will be happy. Buy these new clothes and you will be happy. Buy this holiday and you will be happy.

Looking for advice for someone who's SO is dealing with depression,"So for a while now my GF had told me shes been battling depression (as long as I know) for a year now at this point. I've tried everything. Or what I feel is everything. I've coddled her when she takes a nap because she likes it but it turned into me thinking I'm feeding into it and I stopped. She didn't like that.  I tried to get her to do a simple task like getting her dirty clothes off the floor so i can clean them, it didnt happen. So I picked up most of the room. Amazon packages and clothes just to have a walking path to the bathroom thinking that would spark something... nothing. I've tried to get her out of bed so we could play mario kart or just talk and hang out. Wouldnt budge. 

I'm starting to feel bad that I cant do anything to help her. Now I do know she is trying to take less naps throughout the day. Her day is work then in between  sleep. As well she is trying to also do at least one productive thing a day hence the 2 options I tried. 

Now I know most people will say go find a therapist and I want her to but as her BF should I also make an attempt to go with her(we live an hour away so attempt my very best to go), or let her sort it out herself and let me help aid her in what she learned about herself.?

Just got fired from my second job ever.,"I have graduated last year and ever since I've been looking for a job. I tried applying as a teacher, cashier, sales assistant, secretary anything and I've been looking for a whole year. Few months ago I got a job at this call center and withing two weeks I got fired because I wasn't making any sales. The second job was last month, I worked as a cashier for two weeks and at the end of the second week I got fired when I asked why they said I was making a lot of mistakes. The thing is that I haven't even begged them to stay I was actually glad they fired me. It was a really shitty job, I had to deal with a lot of rude customers, problems, my managers were impatient and unhelpful and always wanted me to solve problems on my own even though I was new and basically knew nothing. The pay was really low too and they made me work two weeks in a row, 8 hours a day with some few extra hours thrown here and there, I even cried the last day of my second week because they made me work two weeks in a row (this was my second job ever and I was exhausted both physically and mentally). I have also applied to qatar airways and gulf air to become a flight attendant and got rejected both times because I had a little scratch scar on my arm. My boyfriend on the other hand is smart he is an engineer, he landed a job at this company just a few weeks after his graduation except that the company he's working for now is sort of exploiting them and he's busy, tired and grumpy most of the time, so now we barely see each other (we live in different startes) and I feel like our relationship just keeps getting worse and worse everyday, I mean I love him, but since he started working his personality changed, he's grumpy, gets irritated fast, and I feel like he dosen't even like me anymore. Seeing that I've been unemployed for a whole year and that I got fired again just two weeks into my new job my parents were pretty pissed at me my dad even insulted me (they probably think am lazy and I dropped out).

I would give my left hand to see the guy who tried to coerce me into doing sexual favors doe,"I would give my left hand to see the guy who try to coerce me into doing sexual favors die in front of me.

He didn’t get what he wanted but he fucked up my self esteem for a long time. Basically I made the mistake of opening up to him about my depression etc and then got the idea that he should send a dick pic and me something back to make me feel special (creepy, I should’ve just blocked him then but I was really low and I thought he was sweet at the time)

Anyway then we get into an argument and he tries to make things sexual again and this time he wanted me to send a video of me masturbating and send it to him because it would “blow off steam” we went in circles for a while until I blocked him. 

Then he messages me on what’s app and I blew up on him for trying to force me to see my pussy. He said that he just wanted me to be happy and I said when did I fucking ask to be a free hooker? Anyway then he blocked me at that point. But I was still super angry about the whole thing. At him and at myself too for not knowing better.

I know he did this to other girls as well so I gathered evidence like screenshots etc and I found out where he worked. He had some business with some other girl and told her what a creep and predator he is. Now he deleted all his social media and his business’s social media too.

I still hate him so much. It might be extreme but I fucking hate entitled men with a passion. He deserves to gets his ass beat and I hate the fact that I will never be able to do it.

He didn’t get what he wanted but he fucked up my self esteem for a long time. Basically I made the mistake of opening up to him about my depression etc and then got the idea that he should send a dick pic and me something back to make me feel special (creepy, I should’ve just blocked him then but I was really low and I thought he was sweet at the time)

Anyway then we get into an argument and he tries to make things sexual again and this time he wanted me to send a video of me masturbating and send it to him because it would “blow off steam” we went in circles for a while until I blocked him. 

Then he messages me on what’s app and I blew up on him for trying to force me to see my pussy. He said that he just wanted me to be happy and I said when did I fucking ask to be a free hooker? Anyway then he blocked me at that point. But I was still super angry about the whole thing. At him and at myself too for not knowing better.

I know he did this to other girls as well so I gathered evidence like screenshots etc and I found out where he worked. He had some business with some other girl and told her what a creep and predator he is. Now he deleted all his social media and his business’s social media too.

I still hate him so much. It might be extreme but I fucking hate entitled men with a passion. He deserves to gets his ass beat and I hate the fact that I will never be able to do it.
