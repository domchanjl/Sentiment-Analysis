It\\'s never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \\n\\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\\n\\nWe\\'re here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we\\'re here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \\n\\nBut there\\'s an important line to draw here.  There\\'s a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. \\n\\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn\\'t supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit\\'s sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \\n\\nDo not treat any OP\\'s post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can\\'t change their minds or be helped. Anyone who\\'s able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they\\'ve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \\n\\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \\n\\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person\\'s sense that they\\'re unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \\n\\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\\n\\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \\n\\n* **People who say they don\\'t want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn\\'t invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it\\'s not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don\\'t understand what you\\'re going through and I\\'m not going to try\".  People who\\'ve had \"help\" that made them feel worse don\\'t want any more of the same.  It doesn\\'t mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can\\'t give them any comfort.   \\n\\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It\\'s almost never true that death is the only way to end these people\\'s suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone\\'s suicide doesn\\'t mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \\n\\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn\\'t mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don\\'t have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It\\'s important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there\\'s not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \\n\\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\\n\\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don\\'t say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can\\'t turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\\n\\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\\n\\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \\n\\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\\n\\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\\n\\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \\n\\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \\n\\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person\\'s feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don\\'t do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You\\'ve got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren\\'t as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it\\'s fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else\\'s hope of getting help.)\\n\\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone\\'s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client\\'s full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \\n\\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don\\'t recommend trying to engage with them directly.',\n",

Specifically you might see people doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  &lt;strong&gt;There are&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more and better choices than &amp;quot;brutally forcing someone to stay alive&amp;quot; or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an artificial and toxic sense of &amp;quot;solidarity&amp;quot; by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  &lt;strong&gt;Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person&amp;#39;s feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.&lt;/strong&gt;  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; involve persuasion (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do it!&amp;quot;), cheerleading (&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got this!&amp;quot;) or meaningless false promises (&amp;quot;Trust me, it gets better!&amp;quot;), or invalidation (&amp;quot;Let me show you how things aren&amp;#39;t as bad as you think!&amp;quot;).  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it&amp;#39;s fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else&amp;#39;s hope of getting help.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone&amp;#39;s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.&lt;/strong&gt;  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an &lt;strong&gt;extremely unlikely&lt;/strong&gt; outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in &lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/1c7ntr\"&gt;our Hotlines FAQ post&lt;/a&gt;). The goal is always to provide all help with the client&amp;#39;s full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch\"&gt;let us know discreetly&lt;/a&gt; if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don&amp;#39;t recommend trying to engage with them directly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Sometimes I made him bleed slightly. One time he went to school with a bruise on his neck and the school called a cop to our house.

And yet I can&amp;#39;t trust myself, maybe a mirage, or heat exhaustion.&lt;br/&gt;\\nI&amp;#39;m too tired of chasing after endless mirages. I hope you&amp;#39;ll understand that I don&amp;#39;t believe my eyes when you point out the latest body of water. You&amp;#39;re dying of thirst, too. I can see it in your eyes.&lt;br/&gt;\\nI&amp;#39;m tired. I&amp;#39;m so tired. You say there&amp;#39;s a helicopter coming, but where is it? I&amp;#39;ve waited so long. I&amp;#39;ve struggled so long.&lt;br/&gt;\\nI don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s coming.&lt;br/&gt;\\nI&amp;#39;m ready to bury myself in the sand and suffocate. The thirst is raw agony, and all I can do is wait. Wait or die. For the best?&lt;br/&gt;\\nFor a glimmer of water?&lt;br/&gt;\\nIt&amp;#39;s all a mirage. Please let me sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I am almost 40, with nothing but a 500 dollar laptop that my neighbor gave me that is falling apart and only worth around 70 if that. a pair of shoes that are falling apart and hurt when I walk in them. about a dozen worn-out socks and a few shirts and pants all black. mostly sweat pants and two pairs of blue jeans and a worn-out wallet that is falling apart on me. \\n\\nI am on disability getting less than 800$ USD a month and have no educational background no GED was homeless for over 8 years and have bad teeth because of it. some need fixing and one needs a new crown. I wasn't taught dental hygiene until I became homeless and even then brushing and flossing was the least of my worries. it was more of getting food and trying to survive. \\n\\nI spent the past few years trying to get my GED and failed even with tutors and teachers and study groups found out I have learning issues that make it hard for me to get my GED and I basically have to go from the 2nd and 3rd grade to 12th grade in every subject.\\n\\nI have no family, no friends. I am utterly alone in this world. Bought a car two years ago was my first car and was planning on living in it but got scammed out of 3k. been trying to save again for another car to live in but were unable to. \\n\\nRenting a bedroom from an elderly woman with bad health and she is going in for surgery today if she doesn't make it I will be homeless again nowhere to live and unable to survive being homeless this time. My body has arthritis in my lower back, rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and feet. there's days that I just can't get out of bed because of it hurting so badly. there is no way I can survive being on the streets again.\\n\\nI feel like complete and utter crap especially compared to everyone else and now realizing how worthless I am in life and maybe it is for the best I just don't live anymore. I have nothing in this world to live for other than myself and even then I don't care to do that anymore. nothing in my life will get better. \\n\\nI applied for HUD housing and was supposed to move into my own apartment after 7 years of waiting on the list for over 40 hud housing I got accepted to one but I couldn't make it there as I had no money to get there or for first months rent, downpayment, or to have the lights turned on. \\n\\nI spent the past ten years trying to better my life but only to get knocked down every time I get up. For example. saved 3 to 4 years up to 3k and bought my first car then got scammed by the dealership. Resaved money up to 900 dollars than needed two teeth pulled which cost 450 each after tax which drained my 900 I had saved last month after almost a year of saving. Then I got called up for my first apartment ever and couldn't get there. \\n\\nTwo years ago needed eye surgery to remove a cataract in my right eye and now need it done in my left eye but the Dr refuses and now Texas is doing this Real ID stuff where you need a star on your driver license and in order to do that I need an eye exam and I will most likely fail it and lose my driver license because of the cataract in my left eye so there goes the driver license and there goes getting a car to live in. \\n\\nSpent years trying to get my GED only to fail it every time I try. spent the past eight years in the dating scene only to get rejected by women over my weight and told I am worthless and have nothing to offer a relationship or just downright mocked at and laughed at over my weight.\\n\\nI got the cataracts in my eyes from taking Androgel testosterone medication because I have very low testosterone and I am on thyroid meds because my thyroid is basically dead and when they gave the max dose I lost 45 lbs in 8 months with absolutely no changes to my diet or daily routine but then gained it back a year later...\\n\\nI just literally can't take any more of this crummy life and to the point of thinking death is a lot better than this and it is better to be dead than keep failing or being knocked down every time I try to do something with my life. \\n\\nI also suffer from CPTSD = Complex post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I didn't serve just from things I been through in my life and childhood. I also suffer from Severe chronic depression, Severe social anxiety, severe abandonment issues, paranoia and learning issues. I have been diagnosed with them all. \\n\\nI have looked up issues with autism and self-diagnosing that I may be borderline autistic as I have some of the same issues in that spectrum. I am just so tired of fighting and so tired of going through life like this barely being able to breathe and barely being able to survive and have absolutely nothing to show for it.\",\n",

We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. \\n\\nWhen she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.\\n\\nSo fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.\\n\\nTL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.\\n\\nEdit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things.',\n",

Had a traumatic childhood, and battling severe clinical depression. it's really difficult for me to form relationships with new people....I wish with all my heart I was more social and perky and surrounded by a squad of friends.. Truth is I only hv one great friend and I'm pretty sure I value her more than she does me.... He is so charismatic and knows so many people and is total opposite of me. It's a real bummer describing my life to him... Ugh why can't I just be different?!?! \\nPretty sure he will dump me. Damn.\",\n",

When I finally felt good about how I look I decided I would try to get a girlfriend for the first time but she said no. Now my self image is lower than ever.

       "['We\\'ve been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \\n\\nWe\\'ve created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who\\'s wondering whether something\\'s okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you\\'re 100% committed, I\\'ll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people\\'s pain, and why it\\'s important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki\\'s current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \\n\\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who\\'s already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \\n\\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can\\'t read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \\n\\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \\n    \\n    \\n\\n******\\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \\n*******\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**It\\'s important to respect and understand people\\'s experiences and emotions. It\\'s never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \\n\\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\\n\\nWe\\'re here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we\\'re here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \\n\\nBut there\\'s an important line to draw here.  There\\'s a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. \\n\\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn\\'t supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit\\'s sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \\n\\nDo not treat any OP\\'s post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can\\'t change their minds or be helped. Anyone who\\'s able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they\\'ve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \\n\\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \\n\\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person\\'s sense that they\\'re unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \\n\\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\\n\\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \\n\\n* **People who say they don\\'t want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn\\'t invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it\\'s not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don\\'t understand what you\\'re going through and I\\'m not going to try\".  People who\\'ve had \"help\" that made them feel worse don\\'t want any more of the same.  It doesn\\'t mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can\\'t give them any comfort.   \\n\\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It\\'s almost never true that death is the only way to end these people\\'s suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone\\'s suicide doesn\\'t mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \\n\\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn\\'t mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don\\'t have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It\\'s important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there\\'s not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \\n\\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\\n\\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don\\'t say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can\\'t turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\\n\\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\\n\\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \\n\\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\\n\\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\\n\\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \\n\\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \\n\\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person\\'s feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don\\'t do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You\\'ve got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren\\'t as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it\\'s fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else\\'s hope of getting help.)\\n\\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone\\'s trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client\\'s full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \\n\\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don\\'t recommend trying to engage with them directly.',\n",

       "['We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say \"PM me anytime\" in a casual social context.  \\n\\nWe have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We\\'re hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \\n\\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it\\'s much better to respond in public comments, at least until you\\'ve gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\\n\\n*****\\n\\n###Summary###\\n\\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it\\'s unwise to trust them.** \\n\\n\\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it\\'s just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\\n\\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you\\'ll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you\\'ll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \\n\\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don\\'t give their names and callers aren\\'t allowed to request specific responders.  It\\'s much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it\\'s much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It\\'s partly about availability, but it\\'s mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \\n\\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it\\'s much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can\\'t see or police PMs.)  \\n\\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There\\'s no reason why someone who\\'s truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \\n\\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they\\'ve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone\\'s in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\\n\\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don\\'t recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.',\n",

       " 'So bit of a story I’m 22 I’ve never been to therapy or anything like that and I’ve known for a while that I probably should have a long time ago. A little over a week ago my mom and a close family friend sat me down and asked if I was open to trying to get some professional help to which I said yes. So my mom asked if she could come back the next day to decide on a plan of action and it was all very supportive up to this point. \\n\\nWhen she came back the next day she asked if I minded if she went outside to make some phone calls to again “explore our options”. When she returned she told me that some people from an organization called COPE are coming in about an hour and if I had a problem with it I had 15 minutes to decide if I wanted her to call them off. Now I have some pretty bad social anxiety so the idea of two strangers coming to my house to ask me very personal questions didn’t sit very well. Yet when I told her this she argued with me about how “what I was doing hasn’t been working” and “if we don’t do this then what are we going to do?” like I thought that’s what today was for?? Basically she argued with me until it was too late and had no choice. Don’t get me wrong I want help but I kind of thought it’d be on my terms.\\n\\nSo fast forward to today where the people from COPE scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist for me. I have no idea what to expect and that’s what’s kind of freaking me out. Like is she just going to try to put me on medication immediately? What kind of questions is she going to ask? Anybody who as experience and wants to share would be much appreciated. Even if it doesn’t directly answer my question and you just relate to my story I’d still like to hear your input.\\n\\nTL;DR I’m going to the psychiatrist for the first time and am freaked out. Looking for people to tell me what to expect and general advice.\\n\\nEdit: Wow. Just wow you guys. I didn’t know what to expect when I made this post but the amount of support and shared experiences is just amazing thank you all so much. You all gave such good advice I was so much more at ease going in to this. I just got back home from it and for those who are interested I feel like it went well. She seemed very understanding and she was easier to talk to than I expected. She did recommend me to start taking medication to which I did agree to after she explained how it was going to work so we’ll see how it goes. I’m also getting a call later this week to set up my first therapy session so hopefully that also goes well. Thank you all again for the kind words and advice it was very heartwarming and I feel a lot better about things.',\n",
